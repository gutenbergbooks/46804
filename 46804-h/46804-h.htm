<hr class="r5" />
<p>Twelve months have elapsed since we first took the
field, and every successive number of our Miscellany has
experienced a warmer reception, and a more extensive
circulation, than its predecessor.</p>

<p>In the opening of the new year, and the commencement
of our new volume, we hope to make many changes
for the better, and none for the worse; and, to show
that, while we have one grateful eye to past patronage,
we have another wary one to future favours; in short,
that, like the heroine of the sweet poem descriptive of
the faithlessness and perjury of Mr. John Oakhum, of
the Royal Navy, we look two ways at once.</p>

<p>It is our intention to usher in the new year with a
very merry greeting, towards the accomplishment of
which end we have prevailed upon a long procession of
distinguished friends to mount their hobbies on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
occasion, in humble imitation of those adventurous and
aldermanic spirits who gallantly bestrode their foaming
chargers on the memorable ninth of this present month,
while</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"The stones did rattle underneath,</div>
<div class="verse">As if Cheapside were mad."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These, and a hundred other great designs, preparations,
and surprises, are in contemplation, for the fulfilment of
all of which we are already bound in two volumes cloth,
and have no objection, if it be any additional security
to the public, to stand bound in twenty more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THE NINTH.</h3>

<p class="center f90">CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD
GENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS.</p>

<p>It was late next morning when Oliver awoke from a sound,
long sleep. There was nobody in the room beside, but the old
Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast,
and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and
round with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and
then to listen when there was the least noise below; and, when
he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring
again, as before.</p>

<p>Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not
thoroughly awake. There is a drowsy, heavy state, between
sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes
with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything
that is passing around you, than you would in five
nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in
perfect unconsciousness. At such times, a mortal knows just
enough of what his mind is doing to form some glimmering
conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and
spurning time and space, when freed from the irksome restraint
of its corporeal associate.</p>

<p>Oliver was precisely in the condition I have described. He
saw the Jew with his half-closed eyes, heard his low whistling,
and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the
saucepan's sides; and yet the self-same senses were mentally
engaged at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody
he had ever known.</p>

<p>When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to
the hob, and, standing in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes
as if he did not well know how to employ himself, turned
round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his name. He
did not answer, and was to all appearance asleep.</p>

<p>After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped
gently to the door, which he fastened; he then drew forth,
as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor, a small
box, which he placed carefully on the table. His eyes glistened
as he raised the lid and looked in. Dragging an old
chair to the table, he sat down, and took from it a magnificent
gold watch, sparkling with diamonds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;">
<a id="OT1"></a><img src="images/i011.jpg" width="497" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Oliver amazed at the Dodger's Mode of 'going
to work'</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aha!" said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting
every feature with a hideous grin. "Clever dogs!
clever dogs! Staunch to the last! Never told the old parson
where they were; never peached upon old Fagin. And why
should they? It wouldn't have loosened the knot, or kept
the drop up a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows!
fine fellows!"</p>

<p>With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature,
the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety.
At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the
same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings,
brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent
materials and costly workmanship that Oliver had no
idea even of their names.</p>

<p>Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another,
so small that it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed
to be some very minute inscription on it, for the Jew laid it
flat upon the table, and, shading it with his hand, pored over
it long and earnestly. At length he set it down as if despairing
of success, and, leaning back in his chair, muttered,</p>

<p>"What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never
repent; dead men never bring awkward stories to light. The
prospect of the gallows, too, makes them hardy and bold. Ah,
it's a fine thing for the trade! Five of them strung up in a
row, and none left to play booty or turn white-livered!"</p>

<p>As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes which
had been staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver's face;
the boy's eyes were fixed on his in mute curiosity, and, although
the recognition was only for an instant&mdash;for the briefest
space of time that can possibly be conceived,&mdash;it was enough
to show the old man that he had been observed. He closed
the lid of the box with a loud crash, and, laying his hand on a
bread-knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He
trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver
could see that the knife quivered in the air.</p>

<p>"What's that?" said the Jew. "What do you watch me
for? Why are you awake? What have you seen? Speak
out, boy! Quick&mdash;quick! for your life!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir," replied Oliver,
meekly. "I am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir."</p>

<p>"You were not awake an hour ago?" said the Jew, scowling
fiercely on the boy.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, indeed, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" cried the Jew, with a still fiercer look than
before, and a threatening attitude.</p>

<p>"Upon my word I was not, sir," replied Oliver, earnestly.
"I was not, indeed, sir."</p>

<p>"Tush, tush, my dear!" said the Jew, suddenly resuming his
old manner, and playing with the knife a little before he laid it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
down, as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up in
mere sport. "Of course I know that, my dear. I only tried
to frighten you. You're a brave boy. Ha! ha! you're a
brave boy, Oliver!" and the Jew rubbed his hands with a
chuckle, but looked uneasily at the box notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?" said the
Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short pause.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Jew, turning rather pale. "They&mdash;they're
mine, Oliver; my little property. All I have to live
upon in my old age. The folks call me a miser, my dear,&mdash;only
a miser; that's all."</p>

<p>Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser
to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but,
thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the
other boys cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a deferential
look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear,&mdash;certainly," replied the old gentleman.
"Stay. There's a pitcher of water in the corner by the door.
Bring it here, and I'll give you a basin to wash in, my dear."</p>

<p>Oliver got up, walked across the room, and stooped for one
instant to raise the pitcher. When he turned his head, the
box was gone.</p>

<p>He had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by
emptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew's
directions, than the Dodger returned, accompanied by a very
sprightly young friend whom Oliver had seen smoking on the
previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him as
Charley Bates. The four then sat down to breakfast off the
coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had
brought home in the crown of his hat.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing
himself to the Dodger, "I hope you've been at work this
morning, my dears."</p>

<p>"Hard," replied the Dodger.</p>

<p>"As nails," added Charley Bates.</p>

<p>"Good boys, good boys!" said the Jew. "What have <em>you</em>
got, Dodger?"</p>

<p>"A couple of pocket-books," replied that young gentleman.</p>

<p>"Lined?" inquired the Jew with trembling eagerness.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books,
one green and the other red.</p>

<p>"Not so heavy as they might be," said the Jew, after looking
at the insides carefully; "but very neat, and nicely made. Ingenious
workman, ain't he, Oliver?"</p>

<p>"Very, indeed, sir," said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles
Bates laughed uproariously, very much to the amazement of
Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh at, in anything that had
passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what have you got, my dear?" said Fagin to Charley
Bates.</p>

<p>"Wipes," replied Master Bates: at the same time producing
four pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Jew, inspecting them closely; "they're very
good ones,&mdash;very. You haven't marked them well, though,
Charley; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and
we'll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall us, Oliver, eh?&mdash;Ha!
ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"You'd like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as
easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you, my dear?" said the Jew.</p>

<p>"Very much indeed, if you'll teach me, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this
reply that he burst into another laugh; which laugh meeting the
coffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel,
very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation.</p>

<p>"He is so jolly green," said Charley when he recovered, as an
apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour.</p>

<p>The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver's hair down
over his eyes, and said he'd know better by-and-by; upon
which the old gentleman, observing Oliver's colour mounting,
changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of
a crowd at the execution that morning. This made him wonder
more and more, for it was plain from the replies of the two boys
that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally wondered
how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious.</p>

<p>When the breakfast was cleared away, the merry old gentleman
and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon
game, which was performed in this way:&mdash;The merry old gentleman,
placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers, a note-case
in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat-pocket, with a
guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin
in his shirt, buttoned his coat tight round him, and, putting his
spectacle-case and handkerchief in the pockets, trotted up and
down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which
old gentlemen walk about the streets every hour in the day.
Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the
door, making belief that he was staring with all his might into
shop-windows. At such times he would look constantly round
him for fear of thieves, and keep slapping all his pockets in
turn, to see that he hadn't lost anything, in such a very funny
and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down
his face. All this time the two boys followed him closely about,
getting out of his sight so nimbly every time he turned round,
that it was impossible to follow their motions. At last the
Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidentally,
while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that one moment they took from him with the most extraordinary
rapidity, snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin,
pocket-handkerchief,&mdash;even the spectacle-case. If the old gentleman
felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where
it was, and then the game began all over again.</p>

<p>When this game had been played a great many times, a
couple of young ladies came to see the young gentlemen, one of
whom was called Bet and the other Nancy. They wore a good
deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and were rather
untidy about the shoes and stockings. They were not exactly
pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their
faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being remarkably
free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very
nice girls indeed, as there is no doubt they were.</p>

<p>These visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in
consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness
in her inside, and the conversation took a very convivial and
improving turn. At length Charley Bates expressed his opinion
that it was time to pad the hoof, which it occurred to Oliver
must be French for going out; for directly afterwards the
Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies went away
together, having been kindly furnished with money to spend, by
the amiable old Jew.</p>

<p>"There, my dear," said Fagin, "that's a pleasant life, isn't
it? They have gone out for the day."</p>

<p>"Have they done work, sir?" inquired Oliver.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Jew; "that is, unless they should unexpectedly
come across any when they are out; and they won't
neglect it if they do, my dear, depend upon it."</p>

<p>"Make 'em your models, my dear, make 'em your models,"
said the Jew, tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force
to his words; "do everything they bid you, and take their advice
in all matters, especially the Dodger's, my dear. He'll be
a great man himself, and make you one too, if you take pattern
by him. Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my
dear?" said the Jew, stopping short.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"See if you can take it out, without my feeling it, as you saw
them do when we were at play this morning."</p>

<p>Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand as he
had seen the Dodger do, and drew the handkerchief lightly out
of it with the other.</p>

<p>"Is it gone?" cried the Jew.</p>

<p>"Here it is, sir," said Oliver, showing it in his hand.</p>

<p>"You're a clever boy, my dear," said the playful old gentleman,
patting Oliver on the head approvingly; "I never saw
a sharper lad. Here's a shilling for you. If you go on in
this way, you'll be the greatest man of the time. And now
come here, and I'll show you how to take the marks out of the
handkerchiefs."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman's pocket in
play had to do with his chances of being a great man; but
thinking that the Jew, being so much his senior, must know
best, followed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply
involved in his new study.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_THE_TENTH" id="CHAPTER_THE_TENTH"></a>CHAPTER THE TENTH.</h3>

<p class="center f90">OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW
ASSOCIATES, AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A
SHORT BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN THIS HISTORY.</p>

<p>For eight or ten days Oliver remained in the Jew's room,
picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchiefs, (of which a
great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part
in the game already described, which the two boys and the Jew
played regularly every day. At length he began to languish
for the fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating
the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his
two companions.</p>

<p>Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed
by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman's
character. Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came
home at night empty-handed, he would expatiate with great
vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits, and enforce
upon them the necessity of an active life by sending them supperless
to bed: upon one occasion he even went so far as to
knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying
out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.</p>

<p>At length one morning Oliver obtained the permission he
had so eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to
work upon, for two or three days, and the dinners had been
rather meagre. Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman's
giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he
told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship
of Charley Bates and his friend the Dodger.</p>

<p>The three boys sallied out, the Dodger with his coat-sleeves
tucked up and his hat cocked as usual, Master Bates sauntering
along with his hands in his pockets, and Oliver between them,
wondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture
he would be instructed in first.</p>

<p>The pace at which they went was such a very lazy, ill-looking
saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were
going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all.
The Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps
from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas;
while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning
the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and
onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them
into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.
These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of
declaring his intention of seeking his way back in the best way
he could, when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another
channel by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the
part of the Dodger.</p>

<p>They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from
the open square in Clerkenwell, which is called, by some strange
perversion of terms, "The Green," when the Dodger made a
sudden stop, and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions
back again with the greatest caution and circumspection.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Oliver.</p>

<p>"Hush!" replied the Dodger. "Do you see that old cove at
the book-stall?"</p>

<p>"The old gentleman over the way?" said Oliver. "Yes, I
see him."</p>

<p>"He'll do," said the Dodger.</p>

<p>"A prime plant," observed Charley Bates.</p>

<p>Oliver looked from one to the other with the greatest surprise,
but was not permitted to make any inquiries, for the two
boys walked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind
the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed.
Oliver walked a few paces after them, and, not knowing
whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent
amazement.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage,
with a powdered head and gold spectacles; dressed in a bottle-green
coat with a black velvet collar, and white trousers: with
a smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book
from the stall, and there he stood, reading away as hard as if
he were in his elbow-chair in his own study. It was very possible
that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from
his utter abstraction, that he saw not the book-stall, nor the
street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself,
which he was reading straight through, turning over the leaves
when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line
of the next one, and going regularly on with the greatest interest
and eagerness.</p>

<p>What was Oliver's horror and alarm as he stood a few paces
off, looking on with his eye-lids as wide open as they would
possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into this old gentleman's
pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief, which he
handed to Charley Bates, and with which they both ran away
round the corner at full speed!</p>

<p>In one instant the whole mystery of the handkerchiefs, and
the watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy's
mind. He stood for a moment with the blood tingling so
through all his veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a
burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
heels, and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he
could lay his feet to the ground.</p>

<p>This was all done in a minute's space, and the very instant
that Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand
to his pocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp
round. Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he
very naturally concluded him to be the depredator, and, shouting
"Stop thief!" with all his might, made off after him, book
in hand.</p>

<p>But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised
the hue and cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to
attract public attention by running down the open street, had
merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner.
They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than,
guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with
great promptitude, and, shouting "Stop thief!" too, joined in
the pursuit like good citizens.</p>

<p>Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he
was not theoretically acquainted with their beautiful axiom that
self-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been,
perhaps he would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared,
however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went
like the wind, with the old gentlemen and the two boys roaring
and shouting behind him.</p>

<p>"Stop thief! stop thief!" There is a magic in the sound.
The tradesman leaves his counter, and the carman his waggon;
the butcher throws down his tray, the baker his basket, the milkman
his pail, the errand-boy his parcels, the schoolboy his
marbles, the paviour his pick-axe, the child his battledore:
away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash, tearing, yelling,
and screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn
the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls; and
streets, squares, and courts re-echo with the sound.</p>

<p>"Stop thief! stop thief!" The cry is taken up by a hundred
voices, and the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they
fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements;
up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the
mob: a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the
plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend
fresh vigour to the cry, "Stop thief! stop thief!"</p>

<p>"Stop thief! stop thief!" There is a passion <em>for hunting
something</em> deeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched,
breathless child, panting with exhaustion, terror in his looks,
agony in his eye, large drops of perspiration streaming down his
face, strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers; and as
they follow on his track, and gain upon him every instant, they
hail his decreasing strength with still louder shouts, and whoop
and scream with joy "Stop thief!"&mdash;Ay, stop him for God's
sake, were it only in mercy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Stopped at last. A clever blow that. He's down upon the
pavement, and the crowd eagerly gather round him; each new
comer jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse.
"Stand aside!"&mdash;"Give him a little air!"&mdash;"Nonsense! he don't
deserve it."&mdash;"Where's the gentleman?"&mdash;"Here he is, coming
down the street."&mdash;"Make room there for the gentleman!"&mdash;"Is
this the boy, sir?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

<p>Oliver lay covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the
mouth, looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded
him, when the old gentleman was officiously dragged
and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers, and
made this reply to their anxious inquiries.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the gentleman in a benevolent voice, "I am
afraid it is."</p>

<p>"Afraid!" murmured the crowd. "That's a good un."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said the gentleman, "he has hurt himself."</p>

<p>"I did that, sir," said a great lubberly fellow stepping forward;
"and preciously I cut my knuckle agin' his mouth. <em>I</em>
stopped him, sir."</p>

<p>The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something
for his pains; but the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression
of disgust, looked anxiously round, as if he contemplated
running away himself; which it is very possible he might
have attempted to do, and thus afforded another chase, had not
a police officer (who is always the last person to arrive in such
cases) at that moment made his way through the crowd, and
seized Oliver by the collar. "Come, get up," said the man
roughly.</p>

<p>"It wasn't me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other
boys," said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking
round: "they are here somewhere."</p>

<p>"Oh no, they ain't," said the officer. He meant this to be
ironical; but it was true besides, for the Dodger and Charley
Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to.
"Come, get up."</p>

<p>"Don't hurt him," said the old gentleman compassionately.</p>

<p>"Oh no, I won't hurt him," replied the officer, tearing his
jacket half off his back in proof thereof. "Come, I know you;
it won't do. Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?"</p>

<p>Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself
upon his feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the
jacket-collar at a rapid pace. The gentleman walked on with
them by the officer's side; and as many of the crowd as could,
got a little a-head, and stared back at Oliver from time to time.
The boys shouted in triumph, and on they went.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_THE_ELEVENTH" id="CHAPTER_THE_ELEVENTH"></a>CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH</h3>

<p class="f90 center">TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE, AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT
SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE.</p>

<p>The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed
in the immediate neighbourhood of a very notorious metropolitan
police-office. The crowd had only the satisfaction of
accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a
place called Mutton-hill, when he was led beneath a low archway
and up a dirty court into this dispensary of summary justice,
by the back way. It was a small paved yard into which
they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a
bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" said the man carelessly.</p>

<p>"A young fogle-hunter," replied the man who had Oliver in
charge.</p>

<p>"Are you the party that's been robbed, sir?" inquired the
man with the keys.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," replied the old gentleman; "but I am not sure
that this boy actually took the handkerchief. I&mdash;I'd rather not
press the case."</p>

<p>"Must go before the magistrate now, sir," replied the man.
"His worship will be disengaged in half a minute. Now, young
gallows."</p>

<p>This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door
which he unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a small stone
cell. Here he was searched, and, nothing been found upon him,
locked up.</p>

<p>This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar,
only not so light. It was most intolerably dirty, for it was
Monday morning, and it had been tenanted since Saturday night
by six drunken people. But this is nothing. In our station-houses,
men and women are every night confined on the most
trivial <em>charges</em>&mdash;the word is worth noting&mdash;in dungeons, compared
with which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious
felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death,
are palaces! Let any man who doubts this, compare the two.</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when
the key grated in the lock; and turned with a sigh to the book
which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance.</p>

<p>"There is something in that boy's face," said the old gentleman
to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with
the cover of the book in a thoughtful manner, "something that
touches and interests me. <em>Can</em> he be innocent? He looked
like&mdash;By the bye," exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very
abruptly, and staring up into the sky, "God bless my soul!
where have I seen something like that look before?"</p>

<p>After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked
with the same meditative face into a back ante-room opening
from the yard; and there, retiring into a corner, called up before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his mind's eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a
dusky curtain had hung for many years. "No," said the old
gentleman, shaking his head; "it must be imagination."</p>

<p>He wandered over them again. He had called them into
view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long
concealed them. There were the faces of friends and foes, and
of many that had been almost strangers, peering intrusively
from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming
girls that were now old women; there were others that the
grave had changed to ghastly trophies of death, but which the
mind, superior to his power, still dressed in their old freshness
and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness
of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay,
and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be
heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light
to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven.</p>

<p>But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of
which Oliver's features bore a trace; so he heaved a sigh over
the recollections he had awakened; and being, happily for himself,
an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of
the musty book.</p>

<p>He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request
from the man with the keys to follow him into the office. He
closed his book hastily, and was at once ushered into the imposing
presence of the renowned Mr. Fang.</p>

<p>The office was a front parlour, with a panneled wall. Mr.
Fang sat behind a bar at the upper end; and on one side the
door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was
already deposited, trembling very much at the awfulness of the
scene.</p>

<p>Mr. Fang was a middle-sized man, with no great quantity
of hair; and what he had, growing on the back and sides of his
head. His face was stern, and much flushed. If he were really
not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly
good for him, he might have brought an action against his
countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages.</p>

<p>The old gentleman bowed respectfully, and, advancing to
the magistrate's desk, said, suiting the action to the word,
"That is my name and address, sir." He then withdrew a pace
or two; and, with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of
the head, waited to be questioned.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment
perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting
to some recent decision of his, and commending him,
for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and particular
notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.
He was out of temper, and he looked up with an angry
scowl.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said Mr. Fang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The old gentleman pointed with some surprise to his card.</p>

<p>"Officer!" said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously
away with the newspaper, "who is this fellow?"</p>

<p>"My name, sir," said the old gentleman, speaking <em>like</em> a gentleman,
and consequently in strong contrast to Mr. Fang,&mdash;"my
name, sir, is Brownlow. Permit me to inquire the name
of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult
to a respectable man, under the protection of the bench." Saying
this, Mr. Brownlow looked round the office as if in search of
some person who would afford him the required information.</p>

<p>"Officer!" said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side,
"what's this fellow charged with?"</p>

<p>"He's not charged at all, your worship," replied the officer.
"He appears against the boy, your worship."</p>

<p>His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good
annoyance, and a safe one.</p>

<p>"Appears against the boy, does he?" said Fang, surveying
Mr. Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot. "Swear
him."</p>

<p>"Before I am sworn I must beg to say one word," said Mr.
Brownlow; "and that is, that I never, without actual experience,
could have believed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, sir!" said Mr. Fang peremptorily.</p>

<p>"I will not, sir!" replied the spirited old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue this instant, or I'll have you turned out
of the office!" said Mr. Fang. "You're an insolent impertinent
fellow. How dare you bully a magistrate!"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.</p>

<p>"Swear this person!" said Fang to the clerk. "I'll not
hear another word. Swear him!"</p>

<p>Mr. Brownlow's indignation was greatly roused; but, reflecting
that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he
suppressed his feelings, and submitted to be sworn at once.</p>

<p>"Now," said Fang, "what's the charge against this boy?
What have you got to say, sir?"</p>

<p>"I was standing at a book-stall&mdash;" Mr. Brownlow began.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, sir!" said Mr. Fang. "Policeman!&mdash;where's
the policeman? Here, swear this man. Now, policeman,
what is this?"</p>

<p>The policeman with becoming humility related how he had
taken the charge, how he had searched Oliver and found nothing
on his person; and how that was all he knew about it.</p>

<p>"Are there any witnesses?" inquired Mr. Fang.</p>

<p>"None, your worship," replied the policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning
round to the prosecutor, said, in a towering passion,</p>

<p>"Do you mean to state what your complaint against this
boy is, fellow, or do you not? You have been sworn. Now,
if you stand there, refusing to give evidence, I'll punish you
for disrespect to the bench; I will, by &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailer
coughed very loud just at the right moment, and the former dropped
a heavy book on the floor; thus preventing the word from being heard&mdash;accidentally,
of course.</p>

<p>With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived
to state his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment,
he had run after the boy because he saw him running away, and expressing
his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him, although
not actually the thief, to be connected with thieves, he would deal as
leniently with him as justice would allow.</p>

<p>"He has been hurt already," said the old gentleman in conclusion.
"And I fear," he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar,&mdash;"I
really fear that he is very ill."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; I dare say!" said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. "Come;
none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won't do. What's
your name?"</p>

<p>Oliver tried to reply, but his tongue failed him. He was deadly
pale, and the whole place seemed turning round and round.</p>

<p>"What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?" thundered Mr.
Fang. "Officer, what's his name?"</p>

<p>This was addressed to a bluff old fellow in a striped waistcoat, who
was standing by the bar. He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry;
but finding him really incapable of understanding the question,
and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate
the more, and add to the severity of his sentence, he hazarded a guess.</p>

<p>"He says his name's Tom White, your worship," said this kind-hearted
thief-taker.</p>

<p>"Oh, he won't speak out, won't he?" said Fang. "Very well, very
well. Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"Where he can, your worship," replied the officer, again pretending
to receive Oliver's answer.</p>

<p>"Has he any parents?" inquired Mr. Fang.</p>

<p>"He says they died in his infancy, your worship," replied the
officer, hazarding the usual reply.</p>

<p>At this point of the inquiry Oliver raised his head, and, looking
round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught
of water.</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" said Mr. Fang; "don't try to make a fool of
me."</p>

<p>"I think he really is ill, your worship," remonstrated the officer.</p>

<p>"I know better," said Mr. Fang.</p>

<p>"Take care of him, officer," said the old gentleman, raising his
hands instinctively; "he'll fall down."</p>

<p>"Stand away, officer," cried Fang savagely; "let him if he likes."</p>

<p>Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell heavily to
the floor in a fainting fit. The men in the office looked at each other,
but no one dared to stir.</p>

<p>"I knew he was shamming," said Fang, as if this were incontestable
proof of the fact. "Let him lie; he'll soon be tired of that."</p>

<p>"How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?" inquired the
clerk in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Summarily," replied Mr. Fang. "He stands committed for three
months,&mdash;hard labour of course. Clear the office."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were
preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell, when an elderly man
of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed
hastily into the office, and advanced to the bench.</p>

<p>"Stop, stop,&mdash;don't take him away,&mdash;for Heaven's sake stop a
moment," cried the new-comer, breathless with haste.</p>

<p>Although the presiding geniuses in such an office as this, exercise
a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name,
the character, almost the lives of his Majesty's subjects, especially of
the poorer class, and although within such walls enough fantastic
tricks are daily played to make the angels weep thick tears of blood,
they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily
press. Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an
unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder.</p>

<p>"What is this? Who is this? Turn this man out. Clear the
office," cried Mr. Fang.</p>

<p>"I will speak," cried the man; "I will not be turned out,&mdash;I saw
it all. I keep the book-stall. I demand to be sworn. I will not be
put down. Mr. Fang, you must hear me. You dare not refuse, sir."</p>

<p>The man was right. His manner was bold and determined, and
the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up.</p>

<p>"Swear the fellow," growled Fang with a very ill grace. "Now,
man, what have you got to say?"</p>

<p>"This," said the man: "I saw three boys&mdash;two others and the
prisoner here&mdash;loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this
gentleman was reading. The robbery was committed by another boy.
I saw it done, and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified
by it." Having by this time recovered a little breath, the
worthy book-stall keeper proceeded to relate in a more coherent manner
the exact circumstances of the robbery.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come here before?" said Fang after a pause.</p>

<p>"I hadn't a soul to mind the shop," replied the man; "everybody
that could have helped me had joined in the pursuit. I could get
nobody till five minutes ago, and I've run here all the way."</p>

<p>"The prosecutor was reading, was he?" inquired Fang, after another
pause.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man, "the very book he has got in his hand."</p>

<p>"Oh, that book, eh?" said Fang. "Is it paid for?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not," replied the man, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Dear me, I forgot all about it!" exclaimed the absent old gentleman,
innocently.</p>

<p>"A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!" said Fang,
with a comical effort to look humane. "I consider, sir, that you
have obtained possession of that book under very suspicious and disreputable
circumstances, and you may think yourself very fortunate that
the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a lesson
to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet. The boy is discharged.
Clear the office!"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;me!" cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage
he had kept down so long, "d&mdash;me! I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Clear the office!" roared the magistrate. "Officers, do you
hear? Clear the office!"</p>

<p>The mandate was obeyed, and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
conveyed out, with the book in one hand and the bamboo cane in the
other, in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance.</p>

<p>He reached the yard, and it vanished in a moment. Little Oliver
Twist lay on his back on the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned
and his temples bathed with water: his face a deadly white, and a
cold tremble convulsing his whole frame.</p>

<p>"Poor boy, poor boy!" said Mr. Brownlow bending over him.
"Call a coach, somebody, pray, directly!"</p>

<p>A coach was obtained, and Oliver, having been carefully laid on
one seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.</p>

<p>"May I accompany you?" said the book-stall keeper looking in.</p>

<p>"Bless me, yes, my dear friend," said Mr. Brownlow quickly. "I
forgot you. Dear, dear! I've got this unhappy book still. Jump
in. Poor fellow! there's no time to lose."</p>

<p>The book-stall keeper got into the coach, and away they drove.</p>

<h3>THE BUTTERFLY BISHOP.</h3>

<p>Amongst the numerous grievances complained of, during the reigns
of the Anglo-Norman sovereigns, none gave more uneasiness than the
inhuman severity of the forest-laws; they disgusted those nobles not
in the confidence of the monarch, oppressed the people, and impoverished
the country.</p>

<p>The privilege of hunting in the royal forests was confined to the
king and his favourites, who spent the greater portion of their time,
not engaged in active warfare, in that diversion; many of them pursued
wild beasts with greater fury than they did enemies of their
country, and became as savage as the very brutes they hunted.</p>

<p>The punishment for hunting or destroying game in royal forests, or
other property belonging to the crown, was very severe: the offender
was generally put to death; but, if he could afford to pay an enormous
mulct to the king, the sentence was commuted either to dismemberment
or tedious imprisonment.</p>

<p>The propensity of the dignified clergy to follow secular pastimes,
especially that of hunting, is well known: they were ambitious to surpass
the laity in the number and splendid livery of their huntsmen, and
to excel in making the woods resound with the echo of their bugles;
many of them are recorded for their skill in the aristocratic and manly
amusement of the chase. Few persons, however, either ecclesiastic
or secular, equalled Peter de Roches, Bishop of Winchester, in
his fondness for, and prowess in, the chase.</p>

<p>Peter had spent the prime of his life as a soldier,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and having
rendered King John essential service in such capacity, that monarch
conferred upon him the lucrative office of Bishop of Winchester, and
he thenceforth became a curer of souls instead of a destroyer of
bodies.</p>

<p>Peter's appointment as a bishop afforded him ample time to devote
to the fascinating employment of chasing the "full-acorned boar" and
stealthy fox: he thought the hunter's shout, the winding notes of the
clanging horn, and the joyous bark of the hounds, much sweeter music
than the nasal chaunt of the drowsy monks.</p>

<p>It happened one day that Peter, (who was, according to the Chronicle
of Lanercost,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a proud and worldly man,&mdash;as was too often the
case with bishops of that period,) with a bugle dangling at his belt,
and mounted upon a fiery steed, attended by a vast retinue of men,
horses, and hounds, was in hot pursuit of a wary old fox; his courser,&mdash;more
fleet than the mountain roe, scarce bruising the grass with his
iron-shod hoofs,&mdash;like Bucephalus of Macedon, took fright at his own
shadow, and became unmanageable; nor were all the skill and spur
of the rider able to check his impetuous speed: the harder the bishop
pulled, the more unruly became his steed; the bridle now suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
snapped in twain, and the bishop was left to the fate that awaited him.
Velocipede, for so the horse was called, now seemed exultingly to
bound over the deepest ditches, and to clear the highest thorny-twining
hedge with the greatest ease: nothing could moderate his
foaming rage; he resembled more the far-famed Pegasus of Medusan
blood, than the palfrey of a gentle bishop. The retinue, and eager
hounds, notwithstanding their utmost endeavour to keep pace with
their master, were left far behind.</p>

<p>Peter, having no control over his flying barbary, awaited with
truly apostolic calmness and gravity the issue of his wondrous ride,
seriously expecting every minute a broken neck or leg; or, perchance,
to have his preaching spoilt by the dislocation of a jaw-bone.&mdash;Such
thoughts will frequently obtrude themselves into the minds of
men encompassed with similar difficulties, let their presence of mind
be never so great.</p>

<p>After half an hour's ride in such unepiscopal speed, which can
only be compared to that of a steam-engine upon the Manchester
railroad, Velocipede suddenly stopped before a magnificent castle
with frowning battlements and a gloomy moat. The bishop, wondering
at what he saw, was struck dumb with astonishment; for he
well knew that so extensive a castle had not hitherto existed in his
diocese, nor did he know of any such in England. Velocipede seemed
also at his wits' end, and commenced frisking and gamboling
about; and, in making a devotional curvet to the castle, threw the
gallant, but unprepared bishop, over his head. Peter was either
stunned or entranced by the fall,&mdash;whether his senses ever returned
the reader must determine for himself when he has perused what
follows: the bishop, however, always declared that he was never
senseless, and that he could preach as well after, as before his fall.</p>

<p>No sooner was the bishop safely located upon the verdant down
by the reverential feelings of the awe-struck Velocipede, than the
castle's drawbridge fell, and an aged seneschal, of rubicund-tinted
face, with at least fifty liveried lackeys in fanciful suits, ran to assist
the bishop, and help him to regain his legs.</p>

<p>By the aid of a restorative cordial the bishop was resuscitated, and,
upon coming to himself, was welcomed by the seneschal to the castle
of Utopia.</p>

<p>The bishop looked aghast.</p>

<p>"My lord bishop," said the seneschal, "the king, our master, has
been long expecting you; he is all impatient to embrace you: hasten,
my lord, hasten your steps into the castle; the wines are cooled, the
supper is ready; oh, such a supper! my mouth waters at the very
smell thereof! Four wild turkeys smoke upon the spit, seven bitterns,
six-and-twenty grey partridges, two-and-thirty red-legged
ones, sixteen pheasants, nine woodcocks, nineteen herons, two-and-thirty
rooks, twenty ring-doves, sixty leverets, twelve hares, twenty
rabbits, and an ocean of Welsh ones, (enough to surfeit all the mice,
and kill every apoplectic person in the world,) twenty kids, six roebucks,
eight he-goats, fifteen sucking wild-boars, a flock of wild-ducks,
to say nothing of the sturgeons, pikes, jacks, and other fish, both
fresh and saltwater, besides ten tons of the most exquisite native
oysters: and then there are flagons, goblets, and mead-cups overflowing
with frothy ale, exhilarating wine, and goodly mead, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
longing to empty their contents into our parched and ready stomachs,
which are unquenchable asbestos; for we drink lustily, my lord, and
eat powdered beef salted at Shrovetide, to season our mouths, and
render them rabid for liquid in the same proportion as a rabid dog
avoids it."</p>

<p>The seneschal here paused to take breath, for his description of the
supper exhausted the wind-trunk of his organ; and the bishop, seizing
the opportunity of its being replenished, said,</p>

<p>"Peace, hoary dotard! thou hast mistaken thy man; I am Peter
de Roches, Bishop of Winchester, and Protector of England during
the king's sojourn abroad."</p>

<p>"You need not tell <em>me</em> what I already know," replied the seneschal;
"though, it seems, I must again remind <em>you</em> that my lord the king
awaits your coming within the castle walls, and has prepared a sumptuous
supper, with all manner of good cheer, to greet you."</p>

<p>"Supper!" said the bishop in astonishment, "I have not yet
dined; besides I never eat supper."</p>

<p>"The devil take your inhuman fashion, then!" replied the seneschal:
"in extreme necessity I might forego a dinner, provided I
had eaten an overwhelming breakfast; but I would as soon die as
go without my supper. To go to bed without supper is a base and
aristocratic custom; I say it is an error offensive to nature, and nature's
dictates; all fasting is bad save breakfasting. That wicked
pope who first invented fasting ought to have been baked alive in
the papal kitchen."</p>

<p>To the latter part of the seneschal's speech the bishop mentally
assented; but he merely said,</p>

<p>"Go to, thou gorged dullard, and tell thy master to gormandize
without me."</p>

<p>"Well, go I suppose I must, if you will not come," returned the
seneschal, "for I cannot longer tarry here. Ah, Sir Bishop, did you
feel the gnawings of my stomach, you would be glad to throw some
food to the hungry mastiff that seems feeding upon my very vitals!"</p>

<p>"Hold thy balderdash!" said the bishop, who had become very
irritated, and would have sworn, had it been etiquette to do so in
those days, at the effusive and edacious harangue of the seneschal.
"Verily, thy hunger and thirst have gotten the better of thy wits!
Whence comest thou?"</p>

<p>"From within the pincernary of that castle, where I have been
indefatigably filling the goblets," answered the seneschal, smacking
his lips. "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitio! sitio!</i> my parched mouth moistens at the thought!
Oh! the lachryma Christi, the nectar, the ambrosia, and the true Falernian!
Ah! Sir Bishop, some persons drink to quench their thirst,
but I drink to prevent it."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said the bishop, "the wine that thou hast already
drunken hath fuddled thy brains."</p>

<p>"By a gammon of the saltest bacon!" returned the seneschal, "I
have more sense of what is good in my little finger than your reverence
has in your whole pate, or you would not stand shilly-shambling
here whilst so goodly a supper waits within."</p>

<p>The bishop was highly incensed at the seneschal's reflection upon
his pate, and would have followed, had he dared, the slashing example
of his namesake, and have smitten off the ear of this high-priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the pantry; (for he always wore a sword, even in the pulpit,
firmly believing in the efficacy of cold steel, knowing from experience
that it would make a deeper and more lasting impression upon
human obduracy than the most eloquent preaching;) but the bishop
was deterred by prudential reflections from such sanguinary vengeance.</p>

<p>How long the confabulation between the bishop and the loquacious
seneschal would have lasted, and to what extent the patience of
the former might have been tried, it would at this remote period
be difficult to determine, especially as the Lanercost Chronicle does
not inform us. At any rate, it was cut shorter than it would have
been, by the approach of twenty youthful knights, clad in superb
armour, and riding upon horses caparisoned in most costly and gorgeous
trappings; they dismounted, and made a low obeisance. The
bishop returned it as lowly as bishops generally do, unless they are
bowing to the premier during the vacancy of an archbishoprick. The
knights advanced; but Peter remained as firm and majestic as the
rock of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>"Sir Bishop," said the chief of the knights, a youth with a most
beautiful and smiling face, "we are come to request your speedy
attendance upon our lord the king, who with any other than yourself
would have been much displeased at your perverse absence, after you
have been bidden by the steward of the household."</p>

<p>The bishop rubbed, shut, and opened his eyes.&mdash;"Am I bewitched,"
thought he to himself, "or do I dream?"</p>

<p>"Neither the one nor the other," said the knight, who perfectly
understood the bishop's cogitations.</p>

<p>"No? What, then, does all this mean?" inquired the bishop.
"When did my lord the king return from Picardy?"</p>

<p>"Proceed into the castle," replied the knight, "and let him answer
for himself."</p>

<p>"If these people consider this a joke," thought the bishop, "I by
no means think it one. At all events, come what come may, I will
follow up this strange adventure, and be even with these gentlemen.
I have not a bishop's garment," said he, addressing the seneschal;
"how can I appear before the king, accoutred as I am?"</p>

<p>"Knowing how much you are addicted to hunting," returned the
seneschal, "the king will assuredly receive you in your usual costume."</p>

<p>"Tut, fool!" said the bishop sneeringly; "do you forget, or has
your time been so engrossed with epicurean pursuits, that you have
not learnt how a guest, though bidden, was punished because he attended
a supper-party without a proper garment? Find me a becoming
dress, and I will instantly attend his highness' pleasure."</p>

<p>"If you will condescend to follow me," said the youthful knight,
"a sacerdotal dress shall be procured for you."</p>

<p>The bishop, nodding assent, was then conducted in solemn silence
into the wardrobe of the castle, where the obsequious attendants soon
arrayed him in a dress fit for a bishop to sit with the king at supper in.
It was not such unpretending costume as that in which bishops are at
present apparelled; but robes of the tinctured colours of the East,
which were more apt to remind both the wearer and the beholders of
mundane pomps and vanities, than of the humility and simplicity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Christianity. The alb was of most dazzling white, the dalmatica of
gold tissue, the stole was embroidered with precious stones, and the
chasuble, of purple velvet wrought with orfraise, was also studded
with costly orient gems.</p>

<p>The bishop thus splendidly accoutred was conducted with great
state and solemnity into the banqueting-room, one of the most magnificent
and spacious of the kind. It excelled everything he had ever
before seen: odoriferous and fragrant perfumes, fit for a Peri<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to feed
on, saluted his nose; his sight was dazzled by splendid and radiant
illuminations, the most exquisite music stole upon his ear, and laughter
and mirth seemed to be universal; every face (there were many
hundreds in the room) was decked with a smile; there wanted but
one thing to complete the enchantment of the scene,&mdash;the light of
woman's laughing eye.</p>

<p>As the bishop entered the hall, five hundred harpers in an instant
twanged their harps; and the air resounded with trumpets, clarions,
fifes, and other musical instruments, not omitting the hollow drum.</p>

<p>The bishop, being tainted with the superstitious feelings of the age,
easily persuaded himself that he was in an enchanted palace; he
therefore determined to conform to every custom that prevailed in
the assembled company, and by that means he hoped to ingratiate
himself with the presiding spirit. When he had reached the centre
of the hall, the king (he wore a robe of rich crimson velvet, furred
with ermine, over a dalmatica flowered with gold, rubies, emeralds,
pearls, and diamonds, and on his head was a splendid crown beyond
estimation,) descended from a throne of the purest crystal, and advanced
to meet the bishop. As he passed the obsequious nobles, he
received their servile adulation with a smile, and, extending his arms,
folded the bishop in a royal embrace. The latter surveyed with some
awe the brawny shoulders of the king, and regarded with much
respect the amber-coloured locks hanging in great profusion down his
musculous back. The bishop thought that the aquiline nose, the
expansive brow, the large clear azure eye, and the ruddy complexion
of his host, about as much resembled those of his own monarch as a
terrible-looking bull-dog does a snarling mongrel. But he kept his
complimentary thoughts of his host to himself, as he was not at any
time of a communicative spirit,&mdash;he was a proud, not a vain man,&mdash;and
he moreover did not know how his compliment might be received.</p>

<p>The king handed the bishop to the upper end of the hall, and
placed him at his right hand. No sooner were they seated than
twenty trumpeters, in a gallery at the lower end of the room, blew,
as the signal for supper to be served up, three such electrifying blasts,
that, had the building not been as substantial as beautiful, it must
have been shaken.</p>

<p>As the loquacious seneschal, in tempting the bishop to quicken his
steps to supper, has put us in possession of many of the various
articles provided for this festive entertainment, we shall not weary
our reader by recapitulating them; but content ourselves with stating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that, in addition to the solid fare, there were exquisite and delicate
fruits and viands, with wines and liqueurs of the choicest quality and
flavour. The supper-service was of the most superb description,
frosted silver and burnished gold; the goblets, vases, and wine-cups
were of crystal, mounted in gold richly carved. Such a feast the
bishop had never seen or tasted; and yet he was, like many of his
predecessors and successors too, perfectly familiar with the charms
of eating and drinking.</p>

<p>Nothing produces good-fellowship, intimacy, and conviviality more
than a good supper. We do not mean the cold, formal, and pompous
supper given to a fashionable party of the present day; but such as
were peculiar to by-gone days, when the table groaned under hot and
solid joints, and the company, with good appetites as provocatives,
ate and drank right heartily,&mdash;when glee and joy sat merrily upon
every face, and the glass went briskly round. Even misanthropes or
proud men could not be insensible to such festive scenes; their hearts
would necessarily warm as the exhilarating wine washed away their
gloomy and proud thoughts.</p>

<p>The bishop soon became familiar with his host, ate, drank, laughed,
and was merry; (we will not so scandalise the Bench as to presume
that he was drunk, although the Chronicle of Lanercost insinuates as
much;) the conversation was brilliant, the wit bright and poignant,
and the repartees flashed, and often rebounded upon the discharger.</p>

<p>To put a direct or pointed question at any time is, to say the least
of it, ungentlemanly; it very often gives dire offence, is seldom
admired or tolerated even by your most intimate acquaintance; and
men are seldom guilty of it, unless in their cups, or with a desire of
insulting:&mdash;how unpalatable must it be to royalty! As we know
it was the bishop's desire to keep upon good terms with his host,
it is but natural to infer that he would not intentionally insult him by
any rude question. If, therefore, any rudeness occurred on the part
of the bishop, it is charitable to set it down to inebriation, or perhaps
to the bishop's habit of putting questions in the confessional.</p>

<p>To the ineffable surprise of the king, the bishop was so injudicious
as to ask his host, in the most direct and pointed manner, who he
was, and whence he came there.</p>

<p>No sooner had the bishop attempted to satisfy his prying curiosity
by what appeared to him a very natural question, than the hall shook
as if Nature were indignant at his presumptuous inquiry; the whole
place was filled with an effulgent lambent light so brilliant, that it
entirely eclipsed the blaze of the variegated lamps that burned in the
hall; a low murmuring wind followed. The king's eyes seemed to
flash liquid fire as he answered, "Know me for what I am,&mdash;Arthur,
formerly lord of the whole monarchy of Britain, son of the mighty
Pendragon, and the illustrious founder of the Order of the Round
Table."</p>

<p>The bishop, having a firm heart and buxom valour, was far from
being daunted, as most men in a similar situation would have been,
and he inquired whether the story then current was true, that King Arthur
was not dead, but had been carried away by fairies into some
pleasant place, where he was to remain for a time, and then return
again and reign in as great authority as ever; or whether he died by
the sword-wounds he received from the sons of the king of the Picts;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and if so, whether his soul was saved, and come to revisit this sublunary
world. The bishop, meditating authorship, asked a thousand
other questions relative to the immortality of the soul; and so subtle
were they, that, had they been put in these days of sciolism and charlatanry,
his fame would have been as brilliant, lasting, and deserved
as that of the noble editor of Paley's Theology.</p>

<p>Whether King Arthur did not choose to satisfy the bishop's curiosity,
or whether, judging from the usual depth of the human mind,
he thought the immortality of the soul a subject too deep and mystic
for such moonshine treatises as have been written concerning it, the
Chronicle of Lanercost does not inform us. It merely states, that to all
the bishop's searching questions Arthur only replied, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verè expecto misericordiam
Dei magnam</i>." He had no sooner uttered those words than
a roar, like the falling of mighty waters such as Niagara's was heard,
and from the incense-altar another blaze of transcendent light issued:
the whole assembly, excepting the bishop, prostrated themselves and
chaunted a hymn, which he, mistaking for a bacchanal-venatical chorus,
heartily joined in. Upon this outrage of public decency, the chaunt
instantly terminated with a crash resembling what is ignorantly called
the falling of a thunderbolt; the altar again smoked, and horrible
and clamorous noises issued therefrom, like the bellowing of buffaloes,
the howling of wolves, the snarling and barking of hounds, the neighing
of horses, the halloo of huntsmen, and the blasts of brazen trumpets,
all in heterogeneous mingle. The smoke gradually assumed the
appearance of a host of hunters; one of them, evidently their chief,
fixed his glaring eyes upon the bishop, and frowned awfully. The
bishop did not admire the looks of the hunter-chief, and even winced
a little when he raised his ghastly arm, (as a self-satisfied orator does
when about to enforce some appalling clap-trap sentiment,) and said
in a gruff growl, "I am Nimrod, of hunting fame, and such a hunter
was I as the world had not before, or since, or will ever have again.
Yet was I no monopolizer of game, or murderer of men to preserve it,
as some have unjustly charged me. I loved the chase, and taught my
subjects to love it too; but thou, oh Bishop Peter, hast been a cruel
hunter, and strict preserver of game. The tongues thou hast dilacerated,
the ears and noses thou hast cut off, and the wretches thou
hast slain, form an awful catalogue of cruelty, and one that will require
tears of blood to wash out. Hearken to the lamentations of thy
victims, and the bewailings of the widows and orphans thy cruelty
hath made! Hadst thou not been so peerless and bold a hunter, I
should not have condescended to warn you of the terrible fate you
will experience in the world to come, unless you mend your ways.
Lover and encourager that I was, and interested as I still am in that
manly sport, I would sooner that it were entirely lost to the world
than it should be disgraced by human bloodshed. List, I say, to
the cries of the victims whom thou hast sacrificed at the altar of
Diana, thy divinity!" Loud lamentations were now heard, and a hideous
group of dismembered menacing ghosts flitted rapidly before
the bishop's wondering sight. He closed his eyes to avoid their
angry looks; one writer insinuates that he swooned, but we think
that unlikely. Be it, however, as it may, upon his opening his eyes
he neither saw Nimrod, his crew, nor any of the victims of the forest-laws.
They had every one of them disappeared!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>King Arthur, like a brave and magnanimous prince, soon forgot and
forgave the bishop's want of good breeding in asking impertinent
questions; though he severely chid him for having split so many
human noses, and dismembered Christians without the slightest remorse,
for so trifling an offence as infraction of the forest-laws: and
that, too, within the very precinct of Winchester Castle, where the
Round Table was preserved. The bishop thought those offences anything
but trifling, and that the souls as well as bodies of the offenders
merited the severest punishment, instead of commiseration.</p>

<p>King Arthur then denounced the concupiscence of the dignitaries
of the church, and their appetite for, and easy digestion of, the good
things of the world; and he declared that they regarded nothing but
sensual gratification, and wasted their precious lives in banqueting,
hawking, and hunting. He entreated the bishop to leave off his
hunting habits, and to take unto those that were more episcopal and
less sanguinary. He told him that it would add considerably to his
mundane happiness, and tend more to his salvation than ten thousand
thoughtless repetitions of the "pater noster" and twelve thousand of
the "ave Maria." So much did King Arthur say, needless here to
be repeated, that the bishop mentally resolved to profit by the king's
advice. But it occurred to him that he could not suddenly leave off
hunting without assigning a sufficient reason for his determination; and
that if he related what had befallen him, his being a bishop would not
entitle him to credit, nor protect him from the derision of his sovereign
and his courtiers; for who would believe his most solemn asseveration
that he had seen Nimrod, and conversed and supped with
King Arthur?</p>

<p>King Arthur, perceiving what was agitating the bishop's ideas, determined
to assist in fulfilling so righteous a resolve as the bishop was
meditating.</p>

<p>"Extend your right hand," said Arthur; the bishop complied.
"Shut it," said Arthur; the bishop did as he was told. "Now open
it," continued Arthur. The bishop opened his hand, and there flew
therefrom an exquisitely beautiful butterfly.</p>

<p>The bishop, notwithstanding all that he had just before seen and
heard, now in real good earnest believed himself bewitched, and
heartily wished that he had never forsaken the profession of a soldier
for that of a bishop, to be subject to miracles; for in those days miracles
and visions only occurred to the dignified clergy.</p>

<p>King Arthur, compassionating the bishop's perturbation, said,
"Whenever in relating your adventure any one doubts it, you shall
afford him sufficient autopsy of its verity by sending, at all seasons of
the year, a butterfly from your hand, in memorial of me and of your
virtuous resolution."</p>

<p>The bishop cordially thanked King Arthur for his kindness and
consideration, and swore by the face at Lucca, (his favourite oath,)
that as long as he lived, he would never again sound the bugle, follow
hounds, nor punish man, woman, or child for infringing the game-laws;
and that he would moreover exert all his influence with King
John to relax the inhuman severity of the forest-laws.</p>

<p>No sooner had the bishop made a solemn adjuration to that effect
than he felt a stunning blow upon his head, which deprived him of all
sensation. When he recovered, he found himself lying where Velocipede
had thrown him, and the brute quietly grazing by his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The bishop vaulted upon his saddle, spurred his steed, and galloped
off as fast as the creature could go. After a ride of about five
miles, he found his attendants anxiously seeking him. He related all
that had occurred, to their great awe and astonishment; but when
they had autoptical evidence of the truth of his narration, by his letting
loose a mealy-winged butterfly from his hand, their fear and wonder
exceeded all bounds.</p>

<p>The bishop's adventure was soon bruited abroad, and thousands
flocked from all parts of England, Scotland, Ireland, and even the
Continent, to see the man who had supped with King Arthur, and
seen the hunter Nimrod. Many more came to witness a miracle performed:
a circumstance of rare occurrence to the vulgar in those days,
miracles, as we have above observed, being reserved for the private
view of bishops and monks. Those pilgrimaging to Winchester always
sought and received a blessing from the butterfly hand of the
bishop as soon as he was satisfied that a liberal oblation had been
made at the high altar of his cathedral.</p>

<p>The frequent repetition of the miracle obtained for Peter the appellation
of the <span class="smcap">Butterfly Bishop</span>; and the offerings at the high
altar so greatly augmented his revenue, that he never once repented
of his promise to King Arthur. His time was so occupied in performing
the miracle and blessing the people, that he had no time, whatever
was his inclination, for hunting.</p>

<p>The Chronicler ends this strange story in the following words
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid in hoc anima Arthuri mortalis adhuc docere voluerit, perpendat
qui meliùs conjicere poterit</i>:"&mdash;which, for the benefit of our female
readers, may be rendered thus,&mdash;"What the still mortal soul of Arthur
wished to teach by this, let him consider who can best interpret."</p>

<p>Is it creditable to that very respectable academical abstraction, that
indefatigable pioneer to the march of intellect, (which some imagine
to be the rogues' march,) the <em>schoolmaster</em>, notwithstanding his ubiquity,
and his being lately abroad on his travels, that the medical
faculty, with all their appliances of pill and book, have not up
to this hour been able to devise a remedy for a very common-place
disorder, so feelingly enunciated in that touching and eloquent exclamation,
"I really don't know what to do with myself!" or to ascertain
in what category of diseases incident to humanity it is to be
placed? Like hydrophobia, it has baffled the ingenuity of the faculty,
who summarily disposed of the evil between two feather-beds;
and, though no effectual remedy has been devised for this pet
malady, a feather-bed, or an easy-chair, has been found to operate as
a sedative. One thing is clear; that, of all the ills that flesh or spirit
is heir to, this interesting disorder possesses as respectable a degree
of obstinacy and virulency as ever humanity had to cope with.</p>

<p>Talk of being dunned for your own or anybody else's debt; talk of
a favourite horse or dog falling sick just as you are ready to mount,
and the scent reeking hot on the stubble; of being bored, no matter
with what; talk&mdash;even if one is put to that&mdash;of the devil; and what
are all these petty annoyances to that sublime of <em>blue-devilism</em> to
which a poor devil is reduced, when, in his extremity, he reposes
his hands on his "fair round belly," or thrusts them to the very bottom
of his breeches' pockets, with not a cross there to keep the devil
out, and feelingly exclaims, "I really don't know what to do with
myself!" One may double the corner on a dun, or stop his mouth
for three months together with a promissory note, though at the
end of that period it may be as fructifying as any note of admiration;
or, at worst, pay him and be d&mdash;d to him, and there's an end.

the devil, though backed with this world, and his own, and the flesh to
boot. But when that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> of blue-devilism attacks you, what's
the remedy? I don't know&mdash;do you? but this I know; that it is the
most rascally, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. kind of malady, will be generally admitted.</p>

<p>Your poor devil at the East-end, and your devil-may-care fellow of
the West-end, are equally honoured by its visitation; while your happy,
active middle-man, who stands aloof from either end, sturdily bids
it defiance, and slams the door in its face. Under the influence of
this visitor it is that sundry pious pilgrimages are made to the foot of
Waterloo or Blackfriars' bridges, to steal out of life through an archway,
unless the dear enthusiast is interrupted by a meddling officious
waterman, and his senses gently wooed back by the resuscitating
apparatus and warm blankets of the Humane Society. Will Sprightly,
with four thousand a-year unincumbered, doesn't know what
to do with himself, and straightway falls to the agreeable occupation
of encumbering it, and, when it will bear no more, he finds he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
cannot bear himself, and incontinently flies from one state of suspense
to another, and hangs himself; or, should the ruling passion be
strong in death, and he is desirous even then to cut a figure, why, he
cuts his throat; or, the report of a pistol will give you a pretty correct
intimation of his whereabouts, and his probable occupation.
"Temporary insanity" is uniformly the verdict of your "crowner's
'quest" on such occasions; even a physician of any repute will honestly
state on ordinary occasions, particularly when the patient has
the benefit of his skill and experience in helping him to leave this
wicked world, that he died of such and such a disorder, and will manfully
state the name of the disorder, and the world gives him credit
for his skill and integrity. Would gentlemen serving upon "crowners'
'quests" imitate this heroic example, instead of recording the foolish
verdict of "temporary insanity," they would say, "The deceased <em>didn't
know what to do with himself</em>!" This would be intelligible, and the faculty
might stumble upon a remedy; but "temporary insanity" is
too transitory, too fugitive to be grappled with, too vague and indefinite
in its very name ever to do any good, and the patient is generally
"past all surgery" before one suspects he is attacked with insanity,
be it ever so temporary or evanescent: but in honestly recording
that "he didn't know what to do with himself, <em>and thereby came by
his death</em>," it would be but doing justice to that interesting malady.
Thus it could be easily observed in all its stages, from its incipient
symptoms at the gaming or any other well-garnished table, where it
sometimes takes its rise, through all its phases and evolutions, till the
malady comes to a <em>head</em>, and a man blows out his brains. The disease,
through each of these changes, might be stayed in its progress,
and society might be benefited by the honesty of the verdict.</p>

<p>Shade of the "mild Abernethy!" how many thousands of thy patients
laboured under this disorder! and how often did thy sagacious
and provident spirit turn the halter into a skipping-rope, and, in order
that thy patients should live, insist upon a few mouthfuls the less!</p>

<p>To a feeling very near akin to this, Tom Binks found himself reduced,
as, about twelve at noon, he flung himself into an easy-chair,
and sought, from the appliances of its downy cushions, a lenitive for
his wounded spirit. His feet on the fender, the fire gently stirred,
the curtains still undrawn and shutting out the garish sun, his eye
fixed on the glowing landscape formed by the fantastic combination
of the embers in the grate, the corners of his fine mouth drawn down
in hopeless despondency, as if nothing on earth could elevate them,
his hands clasped over his knees, he sat, not knowing what to do with
himself.</p>

<p>The room in which Binks sat was small, but elegant; pictures
of the most costly description covered the walls,&mdash;the most exquisite
that owned him or anybody else as <em>master</em>; gold and silver had done
their work. On the polished surface of the tables were thrown the
most amusing works of the day, the last new novel, the lively magazine,
the gay album, the serious review, all exhibiting on the same
board like so many brethren of the <em>Ravel family</em>, in the most alluring
and seductive shapes; but they exhibited in vain. With all these
elements of happiness around him, what <em>could</em> Binks sigh for? With
easy possessions, he was the most uneasy of human beings. Did he
play, fortune was always in the best humour with him: in the billiard-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the ball bounded from his cue to its destination; in the
field his shot was unerring, and the papers regularly chronicled the
murder, or the music, of his gun: no man stood better with <em>ins</em> and
outs; his maiden speech was said to be <em>shy</em>, simply because it <em>was</em>
maiden, but full of promise. With the ladies he was whatever he or
they pleased; but now you could "brain him with my lady's fan" as
he sits vegetating, or cogitating, on a pile of cushions, his breakfast
scarcely touched, and hardly sensible of his shaggy friend that lay
couched at his feet, with his snout buried in the hearth-rug, and his
bloodshot eye occasionally wandering in search of a regard from his
listless master.</p>

<p>At an early age Binks had contrived to run through half the Continent
and his fortune together; he had travelled from "Dan to
Beersheba," and all was barren; and, at twenty-three, the gay Binks
had serious notions that <em>this</em> was not the best of all possible worlds,
and that <em>that</em> world, commonly known as the other, to distinguish it
from this, might hold out a store of enjoyment of higher zest and
relish than the common-place realities of this. Whether he should
wait for his turn when the passage to it might become quite natural,
or force his way <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vi et armis</i>, that is, with a pistol in hand, (for some
folks <em>will</em> be impatient, and enter in at a breach,) was a matter that
sorely perplexed him. Tired of this hum-drum life, which a man of
common activity can exhaust of its most stimulating excitements in a
few years, was it surprising that he wished for <em>another</em>? But the doubt
that it was a better, would sometimes intrude itself, and agitate the
very powder in the pan of the pistol that lay before him on the breakfast
table. Now that the murder is out, it must be confessed that
Binks had a notion of shooting himself.</p>

<p>What heroic resolves he then made! What a noble contempt for
this world he then exhibited as he resolutely eyed the pistol, curiously
scanned its silver mounting, saw that the powder was in the
pan, looked anxiously around to see that none intruded, or should deprive
him of the honour of falling by his own hand: still he hesitated;
he lifted the deadly weapon with one hand, and with the other a
volume of Shakspeare, which opened at the play of <cite>Hamlet</cite>, and, by
the hasty glance which he threw on it, he perceived that "the Eternal
had set his canon 'gainst self-slaughter," and Binks was perplexed.
It became now a matter not so much of life and death as of simple
calculation; on one side there was a pistol <em>for</em>, and on the other
a <em>canon 'gainst</em> self-slaughter. In this state of indecision, thus sorely
beset with adverse arguments, what did Binks do? Why, he acted
somewhat like a sensible man; he yielded to the heavier weight of
metal,&mdash;the great-gun of Shakspeare carried it; and he consented to
live, drew the charge, lest he should return to it, (for he knew his
man,) and made up his mind that Shakspeare was a sensible fellow.
Have you ever felt as if your very heart-strings were tugged at by
wild horses, when the infernal host of <em>blues</em>, marshalled by the devil
himself, have taken the field against your peace, and that you don't
know what to do with yourself?</p>

<p class="linequot">"Throw but a stone, the giant dies."</p>

<p>Very good; but a pebble of such potency is not always at hand, particularly
in a drawing-room. Do something, no matter what: go into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the open air; there's your window invitingly open, and, provided it is
not too far from the ground, 'tis but a step in advance to the shock
that may rouse you. Turn financier,&mdash;chancellor of your own exchequer;
there's your tailor's bill lying on the table, wooing you to analyze
its soft items; give it a first reading, and pass it. What a relief,
on such occasions, is the presence of any living creature!&mdash;your sleek
tabby,&mdash;no,&mdash;that fellow doesn't know what to do with himself neither.
Your playful little Italian grey-hound, whose playfulness is the
very poetry of motion. And Binks found no relief in these gentle appliances.
There he lies, flung upon his ottoman, and dallying with
its downy cushions, with his foot of almost feminine symmetry coquetting
with his morocco slipper, jerking it off and on according to the
intensity of the fit. Ponto stands before him. Noble dog, Ponto!
He, too, has his turn at the slipper, and seizes it in his huge mouth,
and gambols round the room with it, and now crouches with it before
his master, and earnestly looks at him, and those two eyes of his
suggest a double-barrelled gun, and this puts a pistol into his head,
and there it was at hand, lying on the table, just ready for a charge.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cently," said a servant, half-opening the door; and Binks indolently
extended the forefinger of his jewelled hand to his visitor.</p>

<p>"Very glad to see you, Cently; this mortgage, I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is over due, Mr. Binks,&mdash;must redeem, though. I shan't let it
out of the family. The sum is large&mdash;hard to get&mdash;bad times. Fine
dog that&mdash;bulls and bears are very sulky to-day on 'Change.&mdash;Dear
me, a murderous-looking pistol that, sir&mdash;muzzle to muzzle&mdash;then
brains against the wall."</p>

<p>"Provided he has them," said Binks.</p>

<p>"Every man has a little&mdash;quality's the thing. I have to meet Scrip
in the City at two&mdash;no time to lose, sir;" and Binks, who was made
aware of the necessity of a visit to the City, to arrange the terms of
a loan, put himself under the plastic hands of Bedo, and in a few
minutes the pair were rolling towards the City in Cently's carriage,
which thundered along, scarcely waiting to take the necessary turns,
and narrowly escaped running down several old women of both
sexes, till they came to Charing-Cross.</p>

<p>"Money is scarce in these times," said Cently, as a sprinkling of
cabs and omnibuses impeded their course; "broad acres are fine
things. I mustn't let them go. The sum is large&mdash;ten per cent."</p>

<p>All this, and a few other equally interesting particulars, were lost
upon the abstract Binks, who was quietly lolling back in the carriage,
and exercising his optics and calculating powers on the size, number,
and colours of the tom-cats as they sunned themselves on the
gutters, or held attic intercourse with one another, between May-fair
and Temple-bar.</p>

<p>"You understand me," continued Cently; "let me see; how many
thousands? I think it cannot be under fourscore,&mdash;great amount that!"</p>

<p>"Not quite so many," said Binks; "I only counted sixty, and I'm
correct to a tail; bet you a rump and dozen on it."</p>

<p>"On what, sir?"</p>

<p>"On the cats, Cently."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! Very facetious, Mr. Binks; but I'm not joking.</p>

<p>"You bore me, Cently. Set me down here. Go, and do the needful;
and when all's ready to sign and seal, you'll find me here;" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Binks alighted from the carriage, and ascended the stairs of the Mansion-house,
which was then alive with sounds and sights of gladness:
a kind of fancy-fair was being held there for the benefit of some
charitable institution, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of the North, and wealth of the
East and West ends were combined in the holy cause of charity. He
entered, and mingled with the gay groups that promenaded the hall,
which was converted into a bazaar, where beauty and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijouterie</i> lured
the careless purchaser,&mdash;where a thousand soft things were said and
handled, and the angel of charity spread her wings over a scene
where streamed and flaunted many a silken banner, and pointed to
every little stand. "Happy country!" thought Binks, "that, amid all
the anxieties and contentions of commerce and politics, remembers
in these noble institutions the cause of the widow and the orphan.
This must be the surest mart for beauty when she's found at a
stand in the sacred cause of charity. Here the thoughtless forget
themselves, and think of others; here the merchant is generous, and
forgets his change."</p>

<p>"I ain't a-going to be done out of my half-crown that way neither,
ma'am," said a burly little personage in top-boots and perspiration to
a lovely girl who presided at a stand, and who was trying to lure a
supplementary half-crown, the balance of a half-sovereign, which,
after much grumbling, he consented to pay for a shaking mandarin.
The thorough-bass in which this was uttered roused Binks from his
reverie, and, on looking round, he beheld the lovely girl in playful
yet earnest contention for the half-crown, which the fat little man
finally surrendered to a few persuasive looks, and good-humouredly
pocketed his shaking mandarin and his chagrin together, and marched
off.</p>

<p>Binks approached, and as she raised her eyes from the gay assortment
before her, still animated with the pious contention in which she
was engaged, they encountered those of Binks, who was riveted to
the spot gazing at the beautiful creature that stood before him. He
turned over a few articles, and became at once deeply immersed in
the gay little miscellany before him. She would show everything.&mdash;Yes,&mdash;the
articles were of the best description; and Binks felt those
taper fingers, as they tossed them about, as if they were busy with his
heart-strings; and the perverse Binks asked twenty different questions,
and got as many answers eloquent and sweet: and then there
were looks lustrous and shy, and blushes deep and enchanting; and
she would go on expatiating on the beauty of her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijouterie</i>, and he
would stand absorbed and drinking in the sweet sound of a voice that
was modulated with the sweetest harmony,&mdash;and she would help him
to a pair of gloves. Binks took several pairs. The first he tried on
were very perverse,&mdash;too tight; and the fairest hands in the City
would distend them, and she would help to draw them on; and then
their palms would meet, and their fingers seek one another, and the
taper finger of the sweet girl and the jewelled hand of Binks would
be imprisoned unconsciously for a few seconds in the same glove.</p>

<p>"I shall take the whole," said he, and Julia (for that was her
name) was delighted; and Binks was asking for more, and pulled out,&mdash;not
his purse, but the disappointed hand that was seeking for it.&mdash;The
purse was not there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt it was that very civil gentleman that rubbed against him
as he was stepping out of the carriage, and apologised. Here was a
grab at heart-strings and purse-strings together. He drew out a box
set with brilliants,&mdash;it would stand him at a pinch,&mdash;and took a small
one from the stand, and he would exchange boxes. And this was
love,&mdash;love at first sight,&mdash;which we would match all the world over
with any at second sight.</p>

<p class="linequot">"Oh, love! no habitant of earth art thou."</p>

<p>Henceforth shalt thou take thy <em>stand</em> at a bazaar, and we shall bare
our bosom to thy shafts, provided they be tipped with a little charity,
and drawn in the holy cause of a benevolent institution! The hours
lingered on as if they too had come to a stand, the evening stole on
apace, group after group vanished from the bazaar, and Binks and
Julia were still in sweet and endearing communion with each other.
The evening was chilly, and he would help on her splendid cachmere;
and the loveliest arm in the City leant on Binks as he led her down
the steps of the Mansion-house. The evening was fine, and he would
see her home; and both wondered to find themselves at her father's
door. And then there was a sweet good-night, and kind looks, and
gentle pressings of the hand, and promises to meet again.</p>

<p>"Want a coach, sir?" said a heavy-coated, slouched-hat brother of
the cab to Binks, as he stood wondering at himself, his adventure, and
the fairy figure that a smart servant in livery had just closed the door
upon.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no,&mdash;I&mdash;I'll walk, friend,&mdash;the night's fine;" which healthy
resolution he was induced to take from certain reminiscences, and his
purse, though absent, was thought of with regret.</p>

<p>And Binks trod his perilous way through the "palpable obscure" of
the City with buoyant spirits, as if a pinion lifted every limb, notwithstanding
a little plebeian pressure from without through Cheapside,
as often as he forgot his own side of the way; and he entered his
club the happiest dog that ever moonlight, or its rival luminary gas-light,
shone upon, and surrendered himself to the intoxicating influence
of the only draught of pure pleasure he ever quaffed.</p>

<p>Julia Deering was the only daughter of a rather comfortable trader,
a man well to do in the world,&mdash;that is, in the City. Business&mdash;business
was at once his solace and his pride, and any pursuit or avocation
in life of which that bustling noun-substantive was not the principal
element, was an abomination in his sight. The West-end, he
thought, had no business where it stood. He looked upon it as
a huge fungus, the denizens thereof good for nothing; and lords&mdash;no
matter of what creation&mdash;he looked upon with the most supreme contempt.
Julia was his only child, and, next his business, the sole
object of his solicitude. She grew into loveliness and womanhood
amid the smoke and seclusion of her father's premises; and, though
turned of "quick seventeen," yet he thought that her settlement in
the world, like the settlement of an account with an old house in the
City, might take place at any time. Any hint to the contrary, whether
through the eloquent and suggestive looks of the maiden herself,
or the unequivocal assiduity of City beaux, was sure to make the old
man peevish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia, with a world of sense, had a spice of romance about her. She
loved the West-end, or anything pertaining to it, as much as her
father hated it. A noble mirror in her little boudoir, as she toyed
and coquetted with her budding beauties before it, frequently hinted
that she might be a fine lady; which could only come to pass by her
becoming the wife of something like a lord. City beaux were her
aversion. They looked at her through <em>stocks</em>, and she often wished
their necks in them.</p>

<p>Many were the stolen visits to the City which Binks made to see
his young betrothed. His suit prospered,&mdash;Julia was everything he
could wish; but as fathers <em>will</em> be in the way on such occasions,&mdash;how
can they be so hard-hearted?&mdash;and as something like his consent
was deemed necessary, Binks, through the medium of a friend, had
the old man's sentiments sounded on the subject; and a decided
refusal, couched in no very flattering terms, was the result. "I cannot
disguise from you," said Julia one evening to Binks, after he had
communicated to her the disastrous intelligence, "that there is much
to encounter in my father's disposition. He is old and wealthy, with
only myself to inherit it; and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;he has the
greatest aversion to a man of rank, and thinks superior manners and
accomplishments only a cover to heartlessness and deceit; and, what
is strange, he has repeatedly said he will never consent to my union
with anybody as long as he is in anything like health,&mdash;in short, till
he is no longer able to protect me himself."</p>

<p>"That is strange indeed!" said Binks, as he hung with the tenderest
rapture on the confiding frankness and simplicity of his fair companion;
"your father's objections are no less serious than strange."</p>

<p>"Can nothing," inquired Julia despondingly, "be done to get over
them?" Had Echo been present, she would have said, "Get over
them."</p>

<p>"There can, there can," said Binks with transport; "I have it.
So long as your father is in good health, he will never give his consent
to your marriage. Now he is old: and suppose he can be persuaded
that he <em>looks</em> ill,&mdash;such things, you know, are done,&mdash;and contrive
that he shall keep his bed for a few days; and then,&mdash;and then,
my dear girl, let the affair be again pressed upon him." And Binks
met the ingenuous blush and smile of his young betrothed as she
acquiesced with an embrace, in which was blended more heartfelt
rapture than ever he experienced in the dissipated round of tumultuous
and exciting pleasures.</p>

<p>"The times are certainly very bad, Julia," said old Deering to his
daughter, as they were at breakfast one morning together; "I never
recollect them so bad;" and he helped himself to a large slice of ham.</p>

<p>"They may be bad, pa," said the daughter; "but you mustn't take
it so much to heart. Everybody notices how ill you look since the
firm of Dobody and Sons went."</p>

<p>The old man suspended a piece of ham, that he had impaled on a
fork, midway between his mouth and plate; and, planting his right
hand on his thigh, he looked earnestly at the girl.</p>

<p>"What connexion, hussey, has that failure with my looks or my
books either? As long as I can keep both free from blotches, I don't
care a fig for what the world says. But I do believe, girl, that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
not as well as either of us could wish,&mdash;I am fallen off in my appetite.
I <em>could</em> finish my ham,&mdash;three slices,&mdash;and a few eggs; but I am a
little changed, Julia. Hussey, you've a sharp eye; and to notice it!"</p>

<p>"Lord! pa," said the insidious Julia, "all your acquaintance notice
it. Mr. Coserly was the first to notice it."</p>

<p>"And what did the rascal say?"</p>

<p>"Why, pa, he said nothing; but there was a great deal in <em>that</em>.
When certain people say little or nothing, they mean a great deal;
and when there is a great deal of meaning in what one does not say,
why, it's a very dangerous thing; isn't it, pa?"</p>

<p>"Very true, child, very true. But what can we have for dinner
to-day, Julia? I expect an old friend of mine, Mr. Tibbs over the
way; a very proper, industrious, well-to-do-in-the-world kind of man
is honest Dick Tibbs. He owes me a trifle,&mdash;but that is nothing between
us. He is none of your West-end chaps,&mdash;no lack-silver spendthrift,&mdash;no
hair-lipped, hair-brained scamp, with all his fortune on his
back, like a pedlar and his wallet.&mdash;Another cup of tea, Julia.&mdash;As I
was saying, honest Dick Tibbs is&mdash;&mdash;' But what's the matter with
the girl? Why, there's the tea running out of the urn these last two
minutes about the floor. Why, Julia, what <em>is</em> the matter? Ah! I
see how it is&mdash;I thought as much. Ye're a cunning pair. But not
yet a while, Julia; time enough, girl,&mdash;time enough. When your
dear mother was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;wo-o-on't be Mrs. Ti-i-bbs for all that, pa," hysterically
sobbed Julia; "I won't be married&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a dear love!" whimpered the old man; "don't think of
marrying him yet until I'm&mdash;&mdash;. But I'm pretty strong yet. I'll
live, so I will, till&mdash;ugh!&mdash;ugh!&mdash;these rheumatics&mdash;as long as&mdash;Deuce
take this old cough!"</p>

<p>"As long as God pleases, pa; as long as God pleases," said Julia;
and she slid her arm coaxingly round her father's neck, and wiped
away the perspiration that stood like whip-cord upon his brow;
and he fell to musing on the girl's words, and left his breakfast
unfinished.</p>

<p>In the course of that week, through the industry of his daughter,
the old man was plagued wherever he went with condolence and
inquiries about his health, which he heard with all the petulance
and irritability of a miser upon whose hoards an unexpected demand
is to be made. He accordingly dosed himself with physic,
gorged himself at his meals, and took such peculiar pains to preserve
his health after this fashion as would have deprived any other person
of it.</p>

<p>A circumstance at length occurred that bade fair to supersede the
necessity of Julia's pious artifice, and to produce ill looks in abundance
in the old man. A house with which he was connected failed,
and involved him in its ruin. This was a blow that smote the old
man to the heart, and he sank under it. Everything was surrendered
to the creditors; and his house, with its splendid furniture, was
submitted to the hammer of the auctioneer.</p>

<p>On the morning of that day a note was put into Binks' hands; it
was from Julia, and to the effect "that as her father's ruin left her
no alternative but to share his lot, she could not, under such circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
think of involving him in their ruin, and begged he would
think no further of the matter."</p>

<p>"Poor girl!" said Binks, as he gazed on the note that told so
briefly of so much calamity. What a real <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonâ-fide</i> misfortune was,
crushing and accumulating, and, as it were, breaking the man's heart
within him, he had no idea of, except what the pathetic in a novel,
or the chapter of accidents in a newspaper, furnished. These things
were well enough to read, and to talk about, at a clear fire-side; but
for a substantial display of energetic and effective sympathy, by succouring
the distressed, it was what he did not think himself capable
of. A second time, however, he mastered his indolence, and drove
to Julia's house.</p>

<p>What a situation was it in, and what a sight did it present! If
there is in this world a scene more harrowing to human feeling than
another, 'tis that presented by one's house on the eve of an auction,&mdash;a
scene of "confusion worse confounded." The tossing about and
displacing, by strange hands, of articles that from time and association
have become part and parcel of ourselves, linked with a thousand
sweet recollections, and the innocent display of which was a
source of dearest household pleasure, now parcelled and ticketed out,
and catalogued, for the curious and malevolent hands and eyes of
strangers! Our dearest and holiest places of privacy intruded upon;
our sweet little nooks and haunts, which are, as it were, set apart for
the most favoured of our household gods, and where only the footsteps
of tenderest love should be heard, now echoing and teeming
with strange sounds and sights!</p>

<p>What a sad volume, and in boards too, is a piece of carpeting
piled in a corner of a room, revealing the unsightly seams of the
naked floor; and "the decent clock," with its hands either broken
or pointed to the wrong hour! The bleak and cheerless hearth,
every brick of which was an object for the vacant and listless gaze of
a pensive abstraction, the scene of sweet gambols and merry gossipings,
all are sad mementos of the "base uses" to which the iron
hand of necessity will convert objects dear to us from the sweetest
household associations.</p>

<p>Elevated in his pulpit, the eloquent Mr. Touchem, the auctioneer,
presided; and, seated beside him, the very picture of broken-heartedness,
was old Deering, bent, and leaning forward on his gold-headed
cane, his eye vacant and listless, looking at every article
with the curiosity of a child, speaking not a word, and only betraying
his interest in the scene by a sympathetic stamp of his cane
on the floor whenever the nervous and grating click of the auctioneer's
hammer on his desk announced the sale of some favourite
article. There was one lot only which he showed any anxiety to possess,
and as the porter handed it round, the old man's countenance
gleamed with pleasure as his eye wistfully followed it: it was the representation
of a little spaniel worked in worsted, and the joint work
of Julia and his deceased wife.</p>

<p>"Rascal!" exclaimed the old man, as the porter somewhat roughly
rubbed the dust off it, "be tender of the poor thing. That's Julia's.
I&mdash;I bid for that; I bid five pounds for that," said the old man, in a
voice scarcely articulate with emotion.</p>

<p>"Six pounds," said a voice in the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who bids against me?" muttered old Deering, as he ran his eye
over the group whence the voice issued. "It was the work of my
poor child's hands, and of her dear departed mother. Another
pound for it, Mr. Auctioneer."</p>

<p>The same voice bid against him.</p>

<p>The old man raised himself in his chair, gazed wistfully and imploringly
in the direction of the voice, and sank back in sullen resignation
in his chair.</p>

<p>"Going for eight pounds&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;the last time!" and the
sharp and sudden click of the auctioneer's hammer, as it fell, came
with a harsh grating sound on the ear of the old man, as he groaned,
and muttered something between a curse and an entreaty.</p>

<p>Old Deering, notwithstanding the utter ruin of his fortune, still
continued, from sheer force of habit, to frequent his old haunts; and
his drooped and wasted figure, with his well-known <em>tops</em> and gold-headed
cane, might be seen loitering about the purlieus of the Exchange,
inquiring the price of stocks with as much anxiety as ever,
and wondering at the ill-manners of some persons who, from his
rambling and incoherent expressions, looked upon him as somewhat
crazed. He was in truth so.</p>

<p>This was the time for the active benevolence of Binks to show
itself; for, except when his indolence stood in the way, he had a
heart. He saw Julia, and gave her the most decided assurances
of his unaltered attachment, as the old man's malady threatened to
become serious. He privately purchased a neat little cottage outside
town, and had all the furniture (for he attended the auction, and
arranged that every article of it should be bought in,) conveyed to it.
He took particular care&mdash;for he consulted Julia on the details&mdash;that
the disposition of the furniture in the new house should, as
nearly as circumstances would permit, be exactly the same as in
the house in town. Her father's easy-chair, pictures, books, the
pianoforte,&mdash;for almost every article had been preserved by the management
of Binks,&mdash;were put into something like their accustomed
places; and little Fidelio, the object of contention at the auction,
looked quite as brisk as ever, enshrined in his glass-case over the mantelpiece,
not a whit the worse for having his jacket dusted. Change
of air, and absence from the scene of his former activity, was suggested
as the best remedy for the malady of the old man.</p>

<p>To this little cottage Julia and her father drove one day, on pretence
of looking for a suitable residence, such as became their altered
circumstances. This little cottage struck his fancy, and he
expressed a wish to see it. A very agreeable young man showed
them over the house. The more he examined it, the more he liked
it; every thing in it was so like what he once had.</p>

<p>"Why, Julia, this is your pianoforte! let me hear you play; I'll
know it among a thousand;" and Julia played "sweet home" for
him,&mdash;an air her father always liked. His eye glistened as she played;
it reminded him of better days and his old house in the City, and
he dropped into his easy-chair. "And Fidelio, the little spaniel!
Why, how is this, Julia?&mdash;And this gentleman?" and he looked alternately
at Binks and Julia. "Ah, hussey! I see how it is; but it's
an odd way of coming together."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And Binks was happy&mdash;happy as the day was long. Julia and
he were married. The gay Binks, like another Hercules, gave up
his <em>club</em> when he married, and was content with his love in a cottage,
with no other interruption to his happiness than the occasional pettishness
of the old man, who could never well forgive Binks for outbidding
him for Fidelio at the auction. And the malady of <em>not knowing
what to do with himself</em> never afterwards attacked him, now that
the odds were two to one against it.</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="THE_FOSTER-CHILD" id="THE_FOSTER-CHILD"></a>THE FOSTER-CHILD.</h2>


<p>"Ten years to-day! Mercy on us, time does fly indeed! it seems
but yesterday. And here she sat, her beautiful fair face all reddened by
the heat, as in her childish romps she puffed with might and main the
fire in this very grate. Dear heart, how sweet a child it was surely!
Well, David, say what folks will, I'm convinced there was a fate
about it."</p>

<p>Before I relate how far David coincided in this opinion of his
"gude wife," I will mention to whom and to what she alluded, and how
I had an opportunity of declaring a similar conviction. Seated, after
a kind reception by the master and matron, in their best room in the
workhouse of L&mdash;&mdash;, at my request they were proceeding to gratify
my curiosity, raised by a picture which hung between the windows.
The subject and execution were striking: it had been hit off at one of
those luckiest moments for the artist, when, unconsciously, the study
presented that inspiration to the task which so rarely occurs in what
is termed "a sitting for a likeness." On a three-legged stool, with
one foot raised upon the fender, and an old pair of bellows resting on
her lap, in the act of blowing the fire,&mdash;long clustering locks, the
brightest yellow that ever rivalled sunbeams, flowing from a head
turned towards her right shoulder, from which a coarse holland pinafore
had slipt by the breaking of one of the fastenings,&mdash;sat a child, apparently
eight or nine years of age, in whose face beamed more beauty,
spirit, and intelligence than surely ever were portrayed on canvass.
Well might the good dame cry, "Dear heart, how sweet a child it
was!" Never before or since have I beheld its equal; and the vivid recollection
of the wonder I then felt, will never cease to throw its light
upon the page of memory till time turns over the new leaf of existence.
What admirable grace! how exquisitely free! she seemed indeed
to inhale the breath that panting look bespoke a lack of. What
joyous fire in her large blue eyes! and then the parted laughing lips,
and small pearl teeth! the attitude how careless, and most natural!
all appeared as much to live as if all actual. But, little do I hope,
gentle reader, to excite in you as lively an interest for the original,
by my weak tints of simple black and white, as the glowing colours of
the picture roused in me. I will not attempt it; but at once proceed
with the story appertaining to the object of my inquiry, as narrated
by the worthy matron of "the house."</p>

<p>"Do you tell the tale, Bessum," said honest David, addressing his
spouse, whose name, from Elizabeth and Betsy, had undergone this
farther proof of the liberties married folks take with one another.
"Do you tell the tale, and, if needs be, I can help you on, where you
forget any part of it."</p>

<p>"Ah! you're a 'cute fellow, David," said Elizabeth; "you know
how to set an easy task as well as any one, 'specially when it's for
yourself to go about; but, never mind, I wun't rate 'e for 't, for I know
'tis a sad subject for you to deal with."</p>

<p>Bessum was evidently right, for the tear that stood trembling for a
moment in the corner of David's eye as she spoke, rolled unheeded
down his cheek; while the handkerchief that seemed to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
taken from across his knees for the purpose of concealing the simplicity
of the tribute his honest heart was paying, was employed, for at
least the tenth time that day, to brush the irreverent dust from the
picture of his "poor dear child."</p>

<p>I was affected to a degree for which I was unable to account, by
the touching sigh poor David heaved as he replaced the handkerchief
on his knees, and resigned himself to the pangs my curiosity was
about to inflict on him. There was a tender melancholy in the kind
creature's face that seemed to mark the lacerated feelings of intense
affection. I could have pressed him to my breast in sympathy of his
sufferings, for I was already a sharer of his grief before I knew the
cause of it. It was at this moment that the dame began her story in
the words of my commencement.</p>

<p>"Ten years to-day," said she, "since that picture was painted,
sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor dear child!" sighed David; from which ejaculation
I inferred that I was about to hear a tale, of which his own daughter
was the heroine: but I was soon undeceived by his wife, who thus
proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It ben't necessary to go farther back into the dear child's life
than to the day on which she was first placed with me to nurse. Who
she is has nought to do with what she is, or the story of her life;
certain sure it is she was the loveliest babe I ever saw, and I and
David were as proud of her as if she were our own, bless her dear
heart! How everybody talked about her! and how all the folks did
love her too, surely! I can't tell ye, sir, how beautiful she was; and,
as she grew, her beauty kept good pace with her years, I promise
you. She was nine years old the day the painter came to make a
likeness of her for her father. Here she sat in this very room, just as
you see her in the picture, sir: she had run in from the garden where
she had been at romps with poor George, and was puffing away at the
fire with an old pair of bellows which she found among the lumber in
the tool-house, when the gentleman, whom she did not notice at first,
was arranging his matters for the painting of the picture. It was at
the moment that she turned round to see who was in the room, that,
as he said, he was so struck with her lovely face he could have taken
her likeness if he had not seen her a moment longer; and, sure
enough, he was not out much in his reckoning, for scarcely had he
taken his pencil in his hand before the little mad-cap bounded out of
the room, and ran off to her playmate in the garden. That is a copy
of the picture, sir; and if the poor dear child were sitting here as she
was on that day, she couldn't look more like herself than that painting
does to me."</p>

<p>David was in the very act of again converting his handkerchief
into a duster; but, after a momentary struggle, for once in a way he
pressed a corner of it to his eyes, and kept his seat.</p>

<p>"Of all those, barring myself and David," continued the dame,
"who loved the sweet child,&mdash;as, to be sure, everybody did more or
less,&mdash;none seemed to dote on her so much as the young gentleman
who was then our village doctor's assistant, and poor George."</p>

<p>"And, pray, who was poor George?" said I.</p>

<p>"Ah! sir, his is a sorry story too; but of that anon. He was a gentleman
born, sir, bless his dear soul! but, before he was barely out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
his teens, study and such like turned his wits, and poor George was
placed in our care, an idiot. Oh! how he would watch and wait upon
his "young mistress," as he used to call the dear child! and Harri&mdash;for
so we nicknamed our little Harriet&mdash;seemed to look up to him
for all her amusements and happiness. Good heart! to see him
racing round the garden till he was fairly tired and beat for breath,
trundling her in the wheelbarrow, and fancying himself her coachman;
and then how he'd follow her wherever she went, as if to protect
her; always at a distance when he fancied she didn't wish him
with her, but never out of sight. She appeared to be his only care;
his poor head seemed filled with nothing but thoughts of her. His
friends used to send him trinkets, and money, and baubles, to amuse
him; and his greatest pride was to take little Harri into his room, and
show her his stores, hang his gilt chains and beads about her neck,
seat her in his large arm-chair, and stand behind it as if he were her
footman, and play all kinds of pranks to make her laugh; for he
seemed pleased when she laughed at him, though he wouldn't bear a
smile from anybody else at the same cause. His senses served him
at times, and then he would fall into fits of the bitterest melancholy
as he sat looking in our sweet child's face, as if reflecting how
much he loved her, and how little his wandering mind was able to
prove his affection! Ah, poor dear fellow! it's well his sufferings
ended when they did, for they would have been terrible indeed if he
had lived till now; but all who loved her best, fell off from her either
by death or desertion when her day of trouble came."</p>

<p>David's resolution was plainly wavering as to the application of his
handkerchief, when Bessum gave it the turn in favour of the picture
on perceiving her husband's emotion, by adding,</p>

<p>"As for David and myself, you know, sir, we are nobody; it would
be strange indeed if we could ever have turned our backs upon the
dear child."</p>

<p>"God forbid!" said David; and little Harri's portrait received the
extra polish breathed upon it by a deep sigh, previous to the ordinary
one emanating solely from the handkerchief. "God forbid!" repeated
David, and Bessum added a hearty amen as she resumed her
story.</p>

<p>"As the sweet child grew up," continued she, "she was the talk of
all tongues far and near; and, before she was fifteen, sir, gentlefolks
came from all parts to see her. A fine time we had of it surely;
first one pretence, and then another, kept us answering questions and
inquiries about her all day long. As for Dame Beetle, who kept a
little shop, and sold gloves, over the way, just facing this window, she
made a pretty penny by the beauty of our sweet child, although the
old simpleton thought it was the goodness of her gloves that brought
her so many gentlemen customers. Why, I have known no fewer
than five or six of the neighbouring squires,&mdash;ay, and lords too,&mdash;so
difficult to fit, that they've been standing over the little counter
by the hour together; but I warrant not to much purpose, as far as
the real object of their visit was concerned. No sooner did horse, or
gig, or carriage stop in the village, than dear Mr. George,&mdash;that is
him that was with the doctor, you know, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, his name was George too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that it was, sir; and down here he would run as fast as legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
could carry him, and his first question was always, 'David, where is
little Harri? Take her into the garden.' And here he would sit till
the gentlefolks opposite were gone away. If ever one creature did
dote upon another, Mr. George loved that sweet child. Ah! would
to Heaven he had lived to make her his wife! but it's all fate, and so
I suppose it's for the best as it is; though I would have died sooner
than things should have fallen out as they have, if that could have
prevented it!"</p>

<p>"A thousand times over," responded David, with a fond glance at
the picture. "I'd rather never have been born than have lived to
weep over the ruin of such heavenly beauty and goodness."</p>

<p>A chill of horror struck upon my heart as I repeated with inquiring
emphasis the word that had produced it.</p>

<p>"The ruin!" said I; "impossible!" and as I raised my eyes towards
heaven at the thought of such a sacrifice, they caught those of
the victim in the picture. I could have wept aloud, so powerful was
the influence of the gaze that I encountered. There sat the loveliest
creature that the world e'er saw,&mdash;an artless, careless child, health,
hope, and happiness beaming in her sweet fair face; her lips, although
the choicest target for his aim, the foil of Cupid's darts, so pure, so
modest was the smile that parted them; her eyes, the beacon-lights
of virgin chastity; her joyous look, the Lethe where pale Care could
come but to be lost,&mdash;it scared off Woe! And were these made for
Ruin to write shame upon! Oh, man!&mdash;monster!&mdash;ingrate fiend!&mdash;I
was roused from my reverie by the perseverance of the good dame,
who thus took up the thread of her discourse, that my exclamation
had broken:</p>

<p>"Ah, poor Mr. George! if he had lived, all would have been
well. I make bold to say, for certain sure, they would have been
man and wife by this time; for though she used to go on finely
at 'that doctor,' as the darling girl used to call him, because he was
the cause of her being taken into the garden so often, without knowing
why,&mdash;for all that, she loved him in her heart, poor dear! as well
she might; for, as I said before, he fairly doted upon her. And yet,
so delicate was his noble mind, he could never as it were talk
seriously to her,&mdash;that is to say, not to make any kind of love to her,
you know, sir. He had known her from a precious babe; and although
his whole heart and soul, I do believe, were set upon one day
making her his wife, if so be as she should not refuse him of her own
free will, still he felt so almost like a father to her, though he was
not more than eight or nine years older than she, that he never could
bring himself to fairly pay court to her as a lover, you see."</p>

<p>"God bless his noble heart!" said David, as he rested his elbow on
his knee, and his chin on the palm of his hand; "he always said he
should be drowned: there's fate again, Bessum, sure enough."</p>

<p>"And did he die by drowning?" said I.</p>

<p>"Ay, sir," replied the dame; "and scarce was he dead, as if they
only waited for that, than our sweet child's misfortunes began."</p>

<p>"Destiny, indeed!" thought I, as a superstitious feeling seemed to
prepare me for the proofs of it.</p>

<p>"She was just sixteen, and that's nearly five years ago, when she
lost him who would have been more than all the world to her, as a
body may say, and when Lieutenant H&mdash;&mdash; brought permission from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a certain quarter to court her for his wife. Heavy was my poor
heart at the thought of parting with the dear child; but more so ten
times over, though I couldn't tell why, at the idea of who I was going
to part with her to. She, poor darling, was proud of the conceit of
being married, and pleased with the gold lace and cocked-hat of the
young sailor. I don't believe the thought of love for him ever once
entered her head: but that was nothing, for she would have loved
any one who behaved kindly to her; and then to be a wife, and her
own mistress, and the mistress of a house! Alack-a-day! she little
knew what she was doing when she promised her hand where her
heart had not gone before, and where none was beating for her. But
it was well she made no objection, for it was to be, whether or no; so
she was spared at least the pain of being forced against her will.
Well, sir, the wedding-day came, and never do I remember such a
day as it was. In vain did the bells ring and the sun shine; folks,
spite of all, and of themselves too, couldn't be merry: they smiled,
and talked, and tried to appear gay; but, to my plain, honest thinking,
there was not a light heart in the village. Poor George, to be
sure, was dancing with delight, for he saw the preparations, and the
fine clothes, and he heard the bells ringing and the neighbours talking,
and he understood that all was for and about his lady, as he then
called his old playmate; and the idea of so much fuss and bustle on
her account made him as proud and happy as if he were to be
the sharer of it. Little did he imagine that it was to end in robbing
him of the only comfort of his hapless life, poor fellow; and as the
bride and bridegroom came from church, where to the very altar
he had followed like a guardian saint, his watchful eye faithful in its
duty to the last, he picked up here and there a flower that the villagers
had strewn, on which she trod, and stuck them in a row in the
button-holes of his waistcoat. But when the time came that our
dear sweet child was to be torn from our arms, then was a scene I
never shall forget. She bade us one by one good-b'ye, as if she didn't
dream of being gone from us a day. It fairly seemed as though Providence
had deprived her of all thought. But when she came to
take her leave of George, she appeared to shrink from bidding him
farewell. She took his hand, and with a fluttering smile said, 'George,
I am going for a ride,' and she was gone! For full three hours after,
George was missing; and when the twilight made us stir to find
where he could be, there by the garden-gate he stood, with the old
wheelbarrow at his side, his handkerchief spread out upon it, as he
was wont to do when he used to wheel his little playmate in it years
agone,&mdash;there was he waiting till she should come 'to ride.' Poor,
poor creature! he had no idea of the journey that she meant, when
she told him she was going for a ride. He knew that he had been
her coachman many a time and oft, and he thought of no other carriage
than that which he had driven. I burst out a-crying at the very
sight of him. There he stood, as confident that she was coming as if
he had seen her on the threshold of the door with her gypsy hat on
her head. Three hours he had waited; and when I saw him, it
would have melted a heart of stone to watch his look, and think upon
the misery in store for him. The sun had gone down, and there was
not a sound to hear, but now and then the melancholy pipe of a robin,
or the distant tinkle of a sheep-bell. Everything seemed sorrowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in silence at our loss; and he that would pine most, alone was ignorant
of it. I hadn't courage to call him away and tell him his misfortune;
but when David brought him in, and told him that his lady had gone
for a ride with the 'new footman,' as the poor fellow called the lieutenant,
the anguish in his face was more woeful than you can think
of, sir. Every day at the same hour he brought the wheelbarrow
to the garden-gate, and kept it there till sunset; then, till he went to
bed, he'd sit arranging the withered flowers in his waistcoat. He
was never obstinate in refusing to do as he was desired; but, unless
he had been bidden to eat and drink, no morsel would have passed
his lips: he never thought of hunger or of thirst; his little mistress,
his old playmate, and, as he thought her, his only friend, alone occupied
his mind, that never wandered now. It was fixed upon one
object, and on that it dwelt. Ten months he pined and lingered for
his loss; and then, more sensible than he had ever been before, poor
George, sir, died!"</p>

<p>"And happy for him that he is no more," said I, anticipating the
sequel of little Harri's story. "He has gone down to the cold bed, it
is true; but his pillow is far smoother than the down that is pressed
in vain for quiet and repose by the heartless and unfeeling."</p>

<p>"True, very true, sir," said David, and I was half in doubt whether
the handkerchief would be put in requisition again; but it kept its
place across the knees of my host, and Bessum continued. "From
the day she left us, sir, we saw no more of our dear child for two
years; but sad was the tale that reached us in the mean while. Think
of her wrongs, sir;&mdash;the man who had taken her, to be parted but by
death, left her the very next day, after he had robbed scores of honest
hearts of the chance of proving the sincerity of their love by a life
of cherishing and devotion."</p>

<p>"God forgive him!" said David, "for I never can."</p>

<p>"The gallows pardon him! for I never would," cried I.&mdash;"And
what became of the deserted wife?"</p>

<p>Bessum, who had for nearly an hour stifled the feelings to which
she was all that time hankering to give vent, finding this either too
seasonable or powerful an occasion to resist, burst into tears; while
David, as a counterpoise to the grief which he had heretofore monopolised,
evinced a well-timed symptom of stoicism, by folding up his
handkerchief at least three times as small as the usual dimensions
which laundresses or common consent have established time out of
mind as its proper limit, and then thrusting it into the salt-box
pocket of his coat, as being the last place, at that particular crisis, to
which, under the influence of his senses, he certainly must have intended
its destination.</p>

<p>"I shall make short work of the rest on't, I promise ye, sir," sobbed
the tender-hearted foster-mother; "it ben't much use to dwell
upon the finish."</p>

<p>"End it at once," said I, impatient of farther melancholy detail.</p>

<p>"Twenty-four hours had not passed, sir, after the heartless fellow
had become a husband, before he was aboard ship, and on his way to
the Indies. He had completed his bargain; he had married our
blessed child, and received his wages for the job. He took her to
the house of one of her relations near London, and without telling
her whither he was going, or when, if ever, he should return, left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
her as I have described. Fancy the sweet soul's sufferings, sir!&mdash;think
what she felt when she found herself a widow before she was
fairly a wife! Oh! my heart bleeds when I recollect her wrongs!
Well, sir, she pined and fretted till those with whom she lived would
fain to have got rid of her, I promise you; and it was not long before
they had their wish."</p>

<p>"And did the poor child die of her distress?" said I. "Alas! so
young!"</p>

<p>"Not just then, sir. You'll scarcely think that the worst of her
troubles had yet to come; but so it was, poor dear! As fate would
have it, she was one day met and followed home by a gentleman,
who, she could not help observing, appeared so struck with her, that,
though he did not offer to speak to her, he seemed determined upon
finding where she lived. Every day for more than a week did he watch
the house nearly all day long; and when at last she went out of doors,
he made the best of the opportunity, and began in the most woeful
manner to tell her how much he loved her, and what he was suffering
on her account, and to beg and pray of her not to be angry with him
for what he could not help. Well, sir, he spoke so mild and respectful,
and seemed so truly miserable, that the wretched widow couldn't
find it in her heart to speak harshly to him, and so at first she made
no answer at all. He told her that he saw she had something on her
mind that distressed her, and said he felt certain sure he could make
her happy, and that not even her displeasure should make him cease
from the attempt. And, sure enough, to her, poor thing! he seemed
to be as good as his word; for, though she forbade him to approach
her in any way again, still he hovered about the house as much as
ever, and wrote such letters, telling of his misery and anxiety on her
account, that, tired out by the ill-treatment of those to whose tender
mercies she was abandoned, sinking under the pangs of her desertion,
and beset by the arts and entreaties of a fine young man, who seemed
to speak so fairly for her comfort and good, in an evil hour the poor
distracted and deluded creature flew to his arms for that protection
which in vain was pledged her by a husband. I have already told
you that, in my opinion, she never had a thought of any love for the
man she had married. It is not to be wondered at, then, that one,
who at least professed himself to be all that a husband should be,
found no great difficulty or delay in gaining her affections and confidence
in return. In short, her young heart, that had never before
known the feeling, was now fixed upon this man with all the fondness
and devotion of a first love. It was no hard matter, therefore, for him
to persuade her to whatever he liked; and the first advice he gave
her for her good, was to take a house in the neighbourhood of one of
the parks, which he made his home, eating, drinking, and riding about
at her expense. Well, sir, for several months this was a life of uninterrupted
happiness for our poor Harri. She had quiet or company
as she liked, and the society of him that she loved to madness. The
first sign of interruption to the joys that, alas! are always too dearly
bought at the sacrifice she had made, was the news of the arrival in
England of her husband, and, within two days after that, his appearance
at her house. Here was a fine to do, indeed! She was alone
in her drawing-room, and no one else in the house but the two maid-servants.
In vain did she entreat and resist him; by main force he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
carried her out of the house; put her into a hackney-coach, without
bonnet or shawl; and drove away with her to the house of his mother.
That man was born to be her torment and ruin, sir. He had left her
when he ought most to have been in her company, and he returned
when his desertion had driven her in misery and despair to seek for
happiness, in the expectation of which with him he had deceived her,&mdash;to
disturb the comfort his heartlessness had neglected to afford her.
Don't fancy that he loved her, sir. 'Twas no such thing, as I shall
soon make clear to you. However, not six hours after she had been
taken away, the dear child was home again, and in the arms of the
man she would have risked her life for. Here was devotion, sir! She
got out of a one-pair of stairs window, by letting herself down with
the bed-clothes as far as they would reach, and by jumping the rest;
and just as she had been taken from her home, without a bit of outdoor
covering, off she set, in the cold and wet of a December night,
and had to walk for full a mile and a half before she got the coach
that carried her home. Did her husband love her, sir? Day after
day he rode or walked past the house, and sent letters to her; but
never once offered to seek out the man that kept his wife from him.
<em>Can</em> he have loved her, sir? To leave her in the quiet possession of
another, and take himself off again to the Indies! So much for the
husband:&mdash;and now for the lover, as he called himself. Matters, I
don't know what, took him to France, and he was to return to her
who was weary of her life in his absence, within a month. He had
not been gone a fortnight before she received a letter from him, written
in a French prison, where he was confined for debt. That hour
she started post for Dover, and in three days they were on their road
home together. Little Harri had released the man she adored, and
brought him away from his troubles in triumph and joy."</p>

<p>David's handkerchief, notwithstanding the depth into which it had
been plunged, and the compactness with which it had been doubled
up, was out of his pocket, unfolded, and across his knees in an instant;
evincing a conviction in the mind of its proprietor that that
part of Bessum's story was approaching to narration which would certainly
call for its application in the united capacities to which David
was in the habit of appropriating it.</p>

<p>The dame resumed; for I should mention that she had made a
preparatory pause, in the interval of which she took occasion to fortify
herself for the coming trial with a considerable pinch of Scotch
snuff.</p>

<p>"They didn't reach home, sir," said she, "for more than a fortnight;
for they stayed a day here, and a day there, to see the sights,
and such like; and because she, poor dear! was in no condition for
much hurry, though she had forgotten that, when she started, as she
did every thing but her devoted love for him she went to rescue.
But, when they did arrive, dearly did our sweet child pay for the
fault a husband's cruelty had driven her to commit, and bitter was
the punishment of Providence: but it was all fate, I'm sure it was;
it must have been; for surely her crime did not call for such a dreadful
judgment as befell her. Oh, good heart, sir! think of the poor
dear after all she had undergone in a journey to a foreign land, where
she had never been before, and all alone, too, sir, without a friend to
help or to advise her! She had left a house fitted and furnished like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a little palace, as a body may say; the homestead of her high-priced,
fatal happiness. Think of her reaching what she thought a home, and
finding none! She was soon to be a mother, and she had not a bed
to lay her down upon! In the short time that she had been away,
the servant in whose charge she left her house, by the help and advice
of a villain she kept company with, had carried off every thing, under
the pretence that she was moving for her mistress! Ah! you may
look surprised, sir, and with reason, <em>but 'tis just as true as you and I
sit here</em>."</p>

<p>"God's will be done!" sobbed David, as he buried his face in his
handkerchief with both his hands. "She's out of harm's way now,
Bessum. God's will be done!" and the simple-hearted man wept like a
boy. The tears ran so fast down the sorrowful face of the poor dame,
that the relief they afforded her enabled her to proceed to the climax
of little Harri's misfortunes.</p>

<p>"She didn't rave and take on, sir," said Bessum. "The hand of
destiny was on her, and she felt it. As calmly as though nothing had
occurred, she bade the coachman drive to a certain hotel; she seemed
to reckon but for a moment between what she had lost and what she
had regained, and she was satisfied with the account as it stood. All
in the world for which she cared was still spared to her,&mdash;she had
herself preserved him, the author of her dishonour, the cause of her
loss, and, the only compensation for it, the father of her child! These
were all she prized; and he who was one and all, now sat beside her.
With a smile of resignation, confidence, and content, she looked in his
face, and said, "What's to be done?"</p>

<p>The eyes upon the canvass seemed to ask <em>me</em> for an answer: I felt
that I could beg subsistence for such a woman; become a drudge, a
slave, or yield my life up for her sake.</p>

<p>"And what was his reply?" cried I.</p>

<p>"Good advice&mdash;good advice, sir," sobbed Bessum. "<em>He asked
her if she did not think she had better go to her old nurse!</em>"</p>

<p>Mute with amazement and disgust, I sank back in my chair.</p>

<p>"What!" cried I, when the power of articulation returned; "was
that the good advice?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir,&mdash;ay! that was all the comfort our poor dear got from her
<em>lover</em>; she asked him for no more. She didn't upbraid him. He had
dealt her death-blow, and she followed his advice; she came to her old
nurse, sir,&mdash;God be praised!&mdash;and I and David closed her precious
eyes for ever, after they had lingered, in their last dim sight, on the
lifeless image of him, whose name, with her forgiveness, and prayer
to Heaven for his happiness, were the last words upon her sweet,
sweet lips!"</p>

<p>"And if a special hand is not upraised to strew his path of life
with tenfold the sharp pangs that he employed to drive his victim
to an early grave," cried I, "it can only be that it has already
crushed the monster into death."</p>

<p>My heart was faint and sick at the recital I had heard. I returned
to my inn; and all that night&mdash;for it was in vain that I attempted
to sleep&mdash;I mused upon this awful dispensation of the wrath of
Heaven, and the dread severity with which the wisdom of vindictive
Providence had stricken the transgression of poor little Harri!</p>

<p class="f90 center">A FRAGMENT.</p>
<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY F. HARRISON RANKIN.</p>

<p class="linequot">"There is a magic in the craft."</p>


<p>Exoterics surmise it to consist in "winks and nods," proverbially
of equal inspiration to steeds labouring under the dispensation of
<em>gutta serena</em>. Mesmer's Animal Magnetism was nothing to the invisible
"tractors." Ticklings of the palm have been surmised; talismanic
numbers have been hinted at; sounds inaudible have been
suggested; together with certain "melodious twangs," awakening
pineal sympathy. Mrs. Veal's ghost, from De Foe's autopsy of the
apparition, evidently held no less a grade in the scale of shadowy society
than that of Master Mason.</p>

<p>John Locke, the philosopher, subsequently one of the fraternity,
opined that the art embraced sorcery, alchemy, the transmutation of
essences and of metals, together with similar common-place desiderata.</p>

<p>Whatever the nature of the spell, its sway is wide. Affinity of
feeling generated by it runs round the world. It may be found in the
land of the Chinese, of the Arab, the Red Indian, and the wild Tartar;
in the frozen circle, habitat of all seals excepting Solomon's, and in
the burning desert,</p>

<p class="linequot">"Terra domibus negata."</p>

<p>Our story relates to the last pleasant locality.</p>

<p>Upon the windward coast of Africa, in a situation calculated to
warm the coolest temperament, stands a European settlement,&mdash;a
pimple of civilization upon the fiery face of a barbarous continent.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time" a lodge had existed there. Its members had
ceased to melt, having gradually melted away; for the constant flux
and reflux of white residents, the brief sojourn of many, and the
death of an appropriate portion, rapidly vary the population of the
little colony. After a lapse of years, however, it was not long since
determined that the lodge should be re-opened.</p>

<p>The house formerly used had become ineligible; and, in the true
spirit of a mason-soldier, a gallant captain offered to receive his brothers
in his own wing of the barracks.</p>

<p>This building was advantageously situated. It crowned the summit
of a high conical hill; so that, although the deluges of the rainy
season were fast approaching, it could with much facility be closely
and effectually tiled. But here, art was still in her swaddling bands;
and although, in our accomplished country, bricklayers and plasterers
are as "plenty as blackberries," in her colony no tiler could be found.</p>

<p>The name of Solyma,&mdash;that prince of architects, and prototype of
modern Wrens and Barrys,&mdash;his glory, and his power over things seen
and unseen, were familiar, especially to the black Mahometan population,
to the sojourning Foulah, and the travelled Mandingo; but
they possessed neither his skill nor his secret, being as mournfully
ignorant of his workmanlike perfections as they are of the name of
the mother of Moses. A tiler, however, was indispensable; and here
arose a difficulty. What black man, Mahometan or pagan, could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
induced to receive instruction; and, regardless of the prophet Mahmoud
on the one hand, and, on the other, of Satan,&mdash;the principal
object of fervid worship amongst the infidels of those hot parts,&mdash;to
hazard his well-being in this world, and his sombre soul in the next,
by tiling the edifice?</p>

<p>Various were the negro gentlemen invited; but few possessed
"hearts big enough." No wonder that in the gold-dust country they
should prove deficient in the "<em>æs triplex!</em>" One refused upon the
very admissible ground that the masons had been accustomed to attend
service in the colonial church once annually; and that, claiming
to himself the same liberty of conscience which he allowed to others,&mdash;being
by birth, and subsequently by conviction, of that extensive
religious "persuasion" called Pagans, and of the particular sect of
the said popular church which worships the devil and reverences
dead men's teeth,&mdash;he must decline compromising his religious principles,
and sanctioning by his presence the heterodox tenets of the
English colonial chaplain.</p>

<p>A second, however, had forsaken the Heathen modes of his ancestors,
and had waxed into a fervent proselyte, under missionary auspices,
in all respects save a tough hereditary prejudice in favour of a
genteel establishment of eight or ten wives</p>

<p class="linequot">"To grind his corn,"</p>

<p>as Mungo Park poetically saith, but</p>

<p class="linequot">"To pound his rice,"</p>

<p>as it doubtless ran in the original and vernacular glote, whether Fantee,
Mandingo, Cosso, Bullum, or Soosoo. This strange conjugal whim,
be it remarked, generally is as unalienable, tenaciously tenable, and
adhesive to the negro taste, as "roast pig" was to the palate of the
mortal Charles Lamb and the immortal "Elia."</p>

<p>This reclaimed pagan, however, professed that he would rather
dine on fried soles, that unclean piscatorial; masticate dog's flesh before
it had become putrid; disbelieve in witchcraft; or put away a
spouse, however freckled, than adjoin himself unto a society whose
nominal master indeed might be the Honourable Colonial Secretary,
but whose real spiritual president, he well knew, could be no other
than Beelzebub the <em>Bugaboog</em>, whose ways he had renounced.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The remaining mass of the negro "ton" declined their services on
reasons no less satisfactory. They appealed to the yet living reputation
of the deceased lodge, which they characterized as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prononcée</i>
to a degree; for the spirit of the building, once redolent of mysteries
and fraternity, prolongs a posthumous existence in their imaginings,
awful and evitabund. It is desolate, for none will enter it; it is
crumbling, for none will repair it; it is shunned as the favourite triclinium
of Sathana, Beelzeboub, and Ashtaroth; it is known as</p>

<p class="center smcap">"The White Man's Devil-House."</p>

<p>As incredulous a negress as ever succumbed to Obeah asserted that,
from its vague interior, bells were heard to toll, and chains to clank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
at the lone hour of midnight, twelve,&mdash;when the "sun lived in the
bush;" and that many a rash eye had been scared away by goblin apparitions
and rank sights. With her own orbs, whilst stealthily prying
through a window, had she beheld no less a potentate than Satan
himself, sucking the blood of a white cock, and feeding a dead man
with palaver sauce.</p>

<p>The idea of secret and mysterious associations is not new to
the negroes; they have not borrowed it from the white man. A
short reference to the nature of such as are familiar to them will
throw light upon the awe with which they regarded the old Devil-House
of the white man, and declined the privilege of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i> at the
new one.</p>

<p>Their own hidden fraternities existed in gigantic organisation, and
with withering power, long before the diseased and "craw-craw"
complexion of European discoverers was known to the natural inheritors
of Warren's jet blacking. Evil rites attend them; and bodily
mutilation, and the chance of slavery, are united to supernatural
horrors. Well aware of this, they naturally imagine similar diabolic
mysteries to constitute the "working" of white man's freemasonry:
nay, more; recognising the superiority, the mastery of the whites in
all things that come under their observation, they take for granted
that the same exists in matters which they do not witness, and, if
their own orgies are terrific, they suppose that those of the white man
must be intensely more so.</p>

<p>Of all men they are most horribly superstitious, and, in consequence,
are victims also to superstitious horrors of the first magnitude.
The forest, or bush, the air, the streams, the ground, swarm
with a surplus population of Satan's imps and witches. Each moment
and each step expose the wayfarer to the gripe of some malicious
fiend. To evade the unwholesome clutch, the limbs are ornamented
with charms and talismans, with dead men's hair and leopards'
teeth. To deprecate and conciliate these animavorous specimens
of African zoology no pains are spared, and temples named
"Devil-Houses" witness the placatory sacrifices to the spirit of
evil.</p>

<p>But this will not suffice. It is not enough simply to protect the
person. Associations are formed which recognise the necessity of
watching over Satan's interests, by visiting with direful vengeance
such members of the tribe at large as may have treated his majesty
with less respect than his station entitles him to expect. There are
liberalists and spiritual republicans even in Africa.</p>

<p>Some writers, in noticing these associations as similar to freemasonry,
have fallen into the same error with the black colonists
aforesaid, who refused their aid to tile the lodge because they confounded
it with their own tremendous and execrable fraternities.</p>

<p>The secret sisterhoods of Africa have their own peculiar charms
and peculiar annoyances. The initiated maidens enjoy much respect,
and a singular liability to be sold to the slave-factory; and many inducements
are held out to the grand-mistress of the order to dispose
of her gentle sisters in this manner, since a well-built maiden, warranted
of clever action, of unblemished points, and sound lungs, will
find bidders at a hundred hard dollars at any respectable bazaar between
Senegal and Guinea. "Inshallah!" (God be praised!) as the
Mahometan slave-merchant thankfully observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The honour, however, compensates for the danger, and they love
to entwine the privileged emblem of their order, the ivory circlets, in
the hair; an ornament that glads the heart of the simple ebony maid,
as feathers and brilliants rejoice that of the blonde or the nut-brown.</p>

<p>The initiations, alas! are attended with ungentle mutilation of the
person; and the trembling and weeping girl is blindfolded, that she
may never know the woman who lacerated her. Gashes, however, on
the face, arms, breast, and back, are favourite ornaments; they are the
unpretending substitutes for rouge and cosmetics. The society is in
a flourishing state, and the worshipful mistress derives a considerable
revenue by the sale of refractory maidens. The guilt generally arises
in the practice of witchcraft and sorcery;&mdash;accomplishments assiduously
cultivated by the young ladies of Nigritia.</p>

<p>But, to return to our story. Enough has been said to explain how
it happened that ideas of awe rested amongst the black colonists
upon "The White Man's Devil-House."</p>

<p>The night was of that deep-toned glory unimagined save by those
who have watched the firmament of a tropical sky. No moon was
up; but the moon-like planets threw upon the sultry ground shadows
of man and horse as they slowly wound round the long mountain path
that led from the sea-washed capital at its foot, to the summit of the
Barrack Hill. As a higher elevation was gained, the suffocating
breath of the low grounds became tempered by the land breeze,
that floated down by the channel of the wide river, and flung itself
rudely upon the hill side. Yet the still, close atmosphere, and the
distant flickering of purple and golden lightning far away to the east
over the lands of savage nations, warned against loitering for the
chance of a tornado. By ones and twos the little straggling brotherhood
alighted at the barrack gates; and there, thousands of miles
from Old England and the fire-side of home, men unconnected by
birth, by interests, or by office, met, and cordially felt that they were
related. Just before entering the chamber whose secrets are bound
as by adamant, the eye fell upon a figure sitting in the verandah in
the very dignity of overmastering terror. His aspect told that he
was following the poet's advice,</p>

<p class="linequot">"Nimium ne crede colori!"</p>

<p>He was a black man awaiting the ceremony of initiation with much
the same intensity of interest that enlivens the criminal at execution.
He appeared the living representative of that fear-stricken island
tree whose trembling leaves distil a sympathetic dew. He was an
old serjeant of the Royal African Corps. Years of discipline had
taught him reverence for the tastes of his superiors; and when invited
by his officer to tile the lodge, overcome on the one hand by
the condescension of the captain, and overwhelmed on the other by
misgivings of latent Satanic cajolery, he had plunged into the Rubicon.
If his commander had deemed it expedient to form an alliance with
so powerful a prince as the prince of darkness, what business had he
to do with it? He had fought at Waterloo, and would fight at any
time against the devil himself if ordered to the charge; but he had
never expected to serve in the same company. However, he sturdily
denied flinching from the approaching trial of his courage.</p>

<p>The negro's burnished face smartened up when all was over. Rumour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
whose numerous tongues, if well pickled, would pair off with
all the boiled turkeys cooked in Christendom on a Christmas-day, and
leave plenty to spare, told the tale of wonder in "quarter less no
time," how Serjeant B. had become a member of white man's purrah;
how he had sat down to supper with Captain &mdash;&mdash; on one side, the
devil on the other, and the chief judge opposite; how the serjeant
thought he recognised the "old gentleman" as a comrade in the Peninsula;
and how the "old gentleman" politely acknowledged similar
remembrances, and took wine with him; and how they had parted, with
mutual hopes and promises of meeting again at some future day, in
the hot season, not in "the rains."</p>

<p>The more the woolly-headed men and maidens of his inquisitive
acquaintance interrogated the serjeant himself concerning his adventure
on that fearful night, the more he would not tell them a word
about the matter; and, to this moment, no mysteries are more mysterious,
no secrets more arcane, than those which trouble the black population
of the little colony respecting "The White Man's Devil-House."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>My great anxiety now was to reach the foot of the English
throne as soon as possible; and I consulted my infidel friend
upon the safest, easiest, and least public manner of putting my
project into execution. I had thought it right to place sufficient
confidence in him to inform him that I was an agent of the
King of Persia, commissioned to make certain proposals to the
King of England; but that it was not my intention to insist
upon an <em>istakbal</em>, or deputation, upon my entry into the principal
city, or to demand either maintenance or lodging at the
expense of the nation: in short, I wished to be as little known as
possible. He assured me that the most private manner of travelling
was a public coach. This rather appeared paradoxical,
for how could I be private and public at the same time? but,
after certain explanations, I found that he was right; particularly
when he assured me that in point of expense the private
mode of conveyance cost about seven times more than the
public.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next morning, having, through the interference
of my friend, paid what was due to the owner of the
caravanserai, I seated myself in the corner of a handsome coach,
drawn by four fine horses, which appeared at the door on purpose
for my convenience. My friend seated himself by my side,
Mahboob was placed on the outside, and we drove off at such
a rate, that I neither had time to find out whether the hour was
fortunate, or indeed to ascertain which was the direction of Mecca,
much less to say my prayers.</p>

<p>We had not proceeded far, when we stopped, and a third
person ascended, and took possession of the corner opposite to
me. He was a coarse-looking infidel, with a sallow face covered
with hair: bushy eyebrows, dirty in appearance, and, as far as I
could discover, wishing to look like one of the people, although
he might be of the race of the <em>omrah</em>. He said nothing upon
entrance,&mdash;not even the English <em>Selam alekum</em>, which I had
long learned to be expressed by the words "Good morning, and
fine day;" but there he sat, as if the orifice of his mouth had
been closed by a stroke of fate. The cast of his eye as it glanced
upon me was not that of hospitality; and I was certain that,
had he been an Arab, I should not have heard the sound of his
pestle and mortar braying the coffee for me in token of welcome.</p>

<p>I discovered that my friend's name, who had hitherto thrown
his shadow over me, was J&#257;n Pûl, words which surprised me,
because they are pure Persian, and might be interpreted, "Soul,
Money!" Although the new-comer eyed me with little kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of aspect, yet, when he looked at my friend J&#257;n, there was a
slight indication of respect; but still he said nothing.</p>

<p>We had scarcely cleared the town, when the coach again
stopped, and we discovered stepping out of a handsome equipage,
with servants and men in <em>kalaats</em> to help him, an infidel,
who, after some delay taken up in providing for his comfort
and accommodation, was helped into our conveyance, and he
occupied the fourth and last place in it. He was a handsome
man, cleanly and handsomely dressed, full of fair forms
and politeness; a perfect contrast to his predecessor, and upon
whose whole bearing and manners was inscribed, in legible characters,
<em>sahib najib</em>, or gentleman.</p>

<p>He was as civil to me as his predecessor had been the contrary.
Having ascertained that I was a Persian, he welcomed
me to his country in a form of words different from those used
in Persia; but in so doing, he not only made my heart glad, but
made his own face white. He then complimented me upon belonging
to a nation whose people willingly obeyed and upheld
the authority of their king, and who were satisfied to live under
the laws of their ancient monarchy. I had so long been unaccustomed
to receive compliments, that, upon hearing this from
the sahib najib, I almost thought myself in Persia again, and
was about preparing a suitable answer,&mdash;one in which I intended
at once to uphold the dignity of my sovereign and to exhibit
my own individual readiness of wit,&mdash;when an uncouth
sound proceeded from the unclean infidel, almost the first sign
of life which he had given, that made me start, stopped my
eloquence, and threw all the sugared words which I had prepared,
back into my throat again. As far as I could understand,
the purport of this inauspicious noise was to announce
to the sahib najib that he had said something in the words
he had addressed to me to which he did not agree, for I perceived
anger and disgust arise in his countenance, while the
looks of "Soul Money," though not much given to change,
also became lowering.</p>

<p>"Surely, sir," said the sahib najib, addressing the unclean
infidel still with courtesy in his manner,&mdash;"surely you will allow,
in these unsettled times, that loyalty to one's king, and obedience
to established laws, is a subject worthy of compliment."</p>

<p>"I allow nothing," replied the other, looking straight forward,
"but what is for the good of the people."</p>

<p>Upon this there arose a discussion so long and so animated,
that it lasted almost all the way to the foot of the English
throne, and of which I could with difficulty catch the meaning,
so new were most of the words used to my ears.</p>

<p>The sahib najib's argument was full of words such as
these; the constitution&mdash;vested rights&mdash;ancient privileges&mdash;funded
property&mdash;established church&mdash;landed interest; and although
we were driving through a country more prosperous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to my eye than even the regions of Mahomet's paradise could
be, surrounded by every luxury, and he apparently the lord of
wealth and luxury, still he seemed to persist that he was ruined
and reduced to beggary, that his country was on the brink of
perdition, and that nothing remained for him to do but to sit
down for the rest of his days upon the nummud of despair,
and to eat the bitter rind of grief.</p>

<p>The rough infidel, on the contrary, argued that constitutional
rights, funded property, land, church, laws, and
a great many more things, of the import of which I was
ignorant, but of which I promised to acquire knowledge, all,
he argued, were alone to be turned to the use of the people;
and thus I began to have some little idea of what was meant by
that People Shah of whom we had heard so much in Persia.</p>

<p>"What!" said the sahib najib, "when you see the constitution
in danger, do not you perceive that it will endanger the
happiness of the people whose cause you advocate?"</p>

<p>"I do not see that it is in danger," said the other. "If
my boat is sinking because we carry too much sail, shall I not
trim my sails and inspect my ballast?"</p>

<p>"But by trimming your boat you would throw all your cargo
overboard, and thus lose all you have," answered the other.</p>

<p>This part of the conversation I understood, and then I said,
"I now understand: when a camel is overladen, and cannot
proceed, on account of the weight of his burthen, either the
camel will die, or I must lighten his burthen."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the rough man, who now for the first time
cast the shadow of his condescension over me. "You are the
lord of quick understanding, and see things."</p>

<p>"But," said his well-dressed antagonist, "I neither agree that
the boat is badly trimmed, or that the camel is overladen:" then,
turning to me, he said, "Surely, sir, you, who have been bred
and born a Mussulman, who have let your beard grow according
to old-established custom, who have washed your hands and feet
in accordance to the precepts of your law,&mdash;you would not
change all at once, because some new sect in your country were
to arise and say, 'Cut off your beard, cease to wash, pray in a
new manner, and say to Mahomet, You are a false prophet;'
you could not in your conscience do so."</p>

<p>"<em>Astafarallah!</em>" said I, blowing over my shoulders at the
same time, "am I mad to eat such a profusion of abomination!"</p>

<p>"You are a man of perfection," said he. "I am sure the
more you see of my country and get acquainted with its present
condition, the more you will agree with me."</p>

<p>I looked towards my friend J&#257;n Pûl, who hitherto had not
uttered a word, and said, "This sahib says nothing. Perhaps
owing to his saying less than we do, he may be the lord of more
wisdom than all our heads put together."</p>

<p>"What can I say," said J&#257;n calmly, "when there is much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
be said on both sides? The highest wisdom is to gather experience
from the past, and apply it to the necessities of the
future."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said the rough man: "we must therefore reform."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said the smooth man: "reform is useless."</p>

<p>I immediately perceived how the matter stood, and, with
that penetration for which all Persians are famous, I discovered
the true state of the whole country. I saw that the people
were divided into two sects, as much opposed to each other as
Jews are to true believers; that plain sense had as little chance
in the controversy as a sober man may have in the brawls of
two drunkards; and that, before things get straight, each of the
drunkards must be sobered by breaking their shins in stumbling
over a stone, or their heads by carrying them too high.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>We continued to drive onwards: the faster we went, the
more the infidels argued. I sat in my corner guessing my way
through their words, and already making up in my mind the
sort of letter which I should write to the Asylum of the Universe
upon the state of this extraordinary country, whilst my
silent friend, with his hook-stick and close-buttoned coat, shut
his eyes and slumbered; only occasionally giving signs of life.
At length we arrived at a house which I supposed might be a
caravanserai, after the Franc fashion, open to true believers,
for, on looking up I saw painted upon a board an elephant with
a castle upon its back. I began to think this might be in compliment
to me, seeing that elephants are part of the state of
Persian monarchs: but I was mistaken, because, instead of
taking any notice of me, the sahib najib, on the contrary, did
not show his usual civility; but, putting his head out of the
window, he asked one of the bystanders, "Is there any news
astir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular," said an unconcerned infidel; "nothing.
The papers say, 'A man threw a stone and has broken
the king's head!'"</p>

<p>"There," said the smooth man to the rough, "there, that
comes of your reform!"</p>

<p>"I deny that," said the other: "on the contrary, it comes of
your no-reform."</p>

<p>"Why, surely," answered the sahib najib, "if you had not
taught the people not to respect their king, to despise his nobles,
and to laugh at the laws, such an atrocity never would have
happened."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, it never would," retorted the other, "if you
had made such changes that the people would love their king,
respect his nobles, and be satisfied with the laws."</p>

<p>"Then you think stoning your king a right thing to do?"
said one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you allow making him odious," answered the other,
"is what ought to be done?"</p>

<p>"Will a stone get up and throw itself?"</p>

<p>"Will a man complain unless he be aggrieved?"</p>

<p>"Hallo! my friend," said the sahib najib to the bystander,
"what is said about this atrocious act, eh?"</p>

<p>"Why, some say, 'Poor king!' others say, 'Poor stone!'" answered
the bystander in the coolest manner possible.</p>

<p>At this I began truly to have an insight into things, and
could not help exclaiming in the bottom of my gullet, "<em>Allah
Allah, il Allah!</em> There is but one Allah!"</p>

<p>"You understood what that man said?" said J&#257;n Pûl to me,
with a sigh, and in a low voice.</p>

<p>"<em>Belli</em>, yes," said I, "wonderful! The men of this country
are lions without saints. Allah! Allah! to throw a stone at
the king, and no executioner by, to cut the wretch's head off."</p>

<p>"No, no," said he, "that must be proved; first, whether it
was a stone; second, whether it was a man who threw it; and,
third, whether it hit the king's head, or some other head."</p>

<p>"<em>Aman, aman!</em> Mercy, mercy!" I exclaimed; "let me return
to Persia. If so little is said about breaking the king's head,
where shall I turn for justice if some one cuts off my ears?
Well may the people want reform!"</p>

<p>"I will just prove to you, sir," said the soft infidel, "that
this case just proves that we want no reform."</p>

<p>"How!" said I, "break your king's head, and nobody to
mend it!"</p>

<p>"That is not the case," said he. "If a people have so much
security from the laws, that not even the poorest wretch, even
for a crime of such magnitude, can be condemned without proof
against him and a full trial, surely they cannot complain: they
are all equal in the eye of the law, and more they cannot want."
He said this in great exultation, having obtained, as he conceived,
a complete triumph over his adversary, and eyed him
with appropriate scorn.</p>

<p>The rough man looked as if his head went round and round,
and as if he were come to a full stop; but, pulling up the two
ends of his shirt,&mdash;I suppose to show that he had one,&mdash;he said,
"If the people have one good law, is that a reason why they
should not have more? The great man may get his head broke,&mdash;he
is rich and mighty, a little salve cures him, and he is as
rich and happy as ever; but the poor man who has broken it,
save the satisfaction of making a good throw, he remains as poor
and miserable as ever."</p>

<p>"Then, sir," said the sahib najib, "you would have what
can never be,&mdash;you would have perfect equality amongst mankind?"</p>

<p>"Yes, truly," exclaimed the other; "because, if all were
equal, there would be no heads broken, and no stones thrown."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>This, too, I understood, and said, "What words are these?
All men cannot be kings, nor can they all be viziers, nor all
khans. I, who know nothing of your extraordinary customs,
I can understand that. Were I to think of being anything
but what I am, might not my neighbour think so too;
and if I wished to be him, and he me, why, then the world
would soon be upside down, and from one end of the universe
to the other there would be nothing but clutching of beards,
and cries of justice, and no justice!"</p>

<p>"Whatever you may say," said the rough infidel, "we must
have more equality in our country than we have at present, or
else the world will turn upside down. The rich must be poorer,
and the poor richer."</p>

<p>During this conversation we were in rapid motion, driving
through streets lighted up as magnificently as if the Shah himself
had ordered a feast of fire-works, and ornamented by shops
exhibiting such riches, that not all the wealth brought from
Hind by Nadir Shah, or amassed by the Sofi, could compare
to it.</p>

<p>"Strange," thought I to myself, "that this people are not
satisfied with their lot!" Passing by a splendid shop, resplendent
with cutlery, part of my instructions came into my head,
and I said to the rough man, "In the name of the Prophet, do
you still make penknives and broad-cloth?"</p>

<p>At this question my companion stared, and said, "Penknives
and broad-cloth, did you say? Why, we have more penknives
and broad-cloth than we know what to do with. We have
made so much and so many, that the whole world has more of
them than it wants; and the poor creatures, the manufacturers,
are starving for want of work. Surely this wants reform."</p>

<p>This was delightful news for me, and I longed to send an
immediate courier to the Shah to inform him of the important
fact.</p>

<p>"Whose fault is it?" said the soft man, determined not to
be beaten on any ground. "If manufacturers will do too
much, whose fault is it but their own? Unless you make a
reform in common sense, surely no other reform is needful."</p>

<p>By this time the coach had stopped, and I found that we
had reached our last menzil. The rough man got out first;
but just as he was stepping down, in order to ensure the last
word, he exclaimed, "We want reform not only in that, but
in everything else,&mdash;more particularly in rotten boroughs."</p>

<p>At these two last words, the soft man became evidently angered,
his liver turning into blood, whilst his face became red.
"Rotten boroughs, indeed! the country is lost for ever if one
borough is disfranchised."</p>

<p>These words were totally new to my ears, and what they
meant I knew not; but I became quite certain that the rough
man had hit the smooth man in a sore place. But I was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
seventh heaven at the end of their controversy. I had never
heard such warmth of argument, not since that famous dispute
at the Medressah, in Ispahan, between two famous Mollahs, the
one a suni, the other a shiah, whether the children of the true
faith, in washing according to the prescribed law, were to let
the water run from the hand to the elbow, or whether from the
elbow to the hand. They argued for three whole moons, and
neither were convinced; and so they remain to this day, each in
his own persuasion.</p>

<p>"How will it be possible," thought I, "to unravel this intricate
question? It is plain these English are a nation of madmen.
Oh! could they but take one look at my country, where
the will of one man is all in all,&mdash;where no man's head is safe
on his shoulders for one moment,&mdash;where, if he heaps up riches
in the course of many years, they may be taken from him in
an hour,&mdash;where he does not even think for himself, much
less speak,&mdash;where man is as withering grass of the field, and
life as the wind blowing over it; could they but know this,
short would be their controversies. They would praise Allah
with gratitude for their condition, be content with their fate,
and drive all wish of change from their thoughts, as threatening
the overthrow of their happiness."</p>

<cite>The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Juliet.</cite><br />
</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Never</span>," says Prince Escalus, in the concluding distich of Romeo
and Juliet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"&mdash;was there story of more woe</div>
<div class="verse">Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is a story which, in the inartificial shape of a black-letter ballad,
powerfully affected the imagination, and awakened the sensibilities,
of our ancestors, and in the hands of Shakspeare has become
the love-story of the whole world. Who cares for the loves of Petrarch
and Laura, or of Eloisa and Abelard, compared with those of
Romeo and Juliet? The gallantries of Petrarch are conveyed in
models of polished and ornate verse; but, in spite of their elegance,
we feel that they are frosty as the Alps beneath which they were
written. They are only the exercises of genius, not the ebullitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of feeling; and we can easily credit the story that Petrarch
refused a dispensation to marry Laura, lest marriage might spoil his
poetry. The muse, and not the lady, was his mistress. In the case
of Abelard there are many associations which are not agreeable; and,
after all, we can hardly help looking upon him as a fitter hero for
Bayle's Dictionary than a romance. In Romeo and Juliet we have
the poetry of Petrarch without its iciness, and the passion of Eloisa
free from its coarse exhibition. We have, too, philosophy far more
profound than ever was scattered over the syllogistic pages of Abelard,
full of knowledge and acuteness as they undoubtedly are.</p>

<p>But I am not about to consider Romeo merely as a lover, or to use
him as an illustration of Lysander's often-quoted line,</p>

<p class="linequot">"The course of true love never did run smooth."</p>

<p>In that course the current has been as rough to others as to Romeo;
who, in spite of all his misfortunes, has wooed and won the lady of
his affections. That Lysander's line is often true, cannot be questioned;
though it is no more than the exaggeration of an annoyed
suitor to say that love has <em>never</em> run smoothly. The reason why it
should be so generally true, is given in "Peveril of the Peak" by Sir
Walter Scott; a man who closely approached to the genius of Shakspeare
in depicting character, and who, above all writers of imagination,
most nearly resembled him in the possession of keen, shrewd,
every-day common-sense, rendered more remarkable by the contrast
of the romantic, pathetic, and picturesque by which it is in all directions
surrounded.</p>

<p>"This celebrated passage</p>

<p class="linequot">['Ah me! for aught that ever I could read,' &amp;c.]</p>

<p>which we have prefixed to this chapter, [chap. xii. vol. i. Peveril of
the Peak,] has, like most observations of the same author, its foundation
in real experience. The period at which love is felt most
strongly is seldom that at which there is much prospect of its being
brought to a happy issue. In fine, there are few men who do not
look back in secret to some period of their youth at which a sincere
and early affection was repulsed or betrayed, or became abortive
under opposing circumstances. It is these little passages of secret
history, which leave a tinge of romance in every bosom, scarce permitting
us, even in the most busy or the most advanced period of life,
to listen with total indifference to a tale of true love."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>These remarks, the justice of which cannot be questioned, scarcely
apply to the case of Romeo. In no respect, save that the families
were at variance, was the match between him and Juliet such as not
to afford a prospect of happy issue; and everything indicated the
possibility of making their marriage a ground of reconciliation between
their respective houses. Both are tired of the quarrel. Lady
Capulet and Lady Montague are introduced in the very first scene of
the play, endeavouring to pacify their husbands; and, when the brawl
is over, Paris laments to Juliet's father that it is a pity persons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
such honourable reckoning should have lived so long at variance. For
Romeo himself old Capulet expresses the highest respect, as being
one of the ornaments of the city; and, after the death of Juliet, old
Montague, touched by her truth and constancy, proposes to raise to
her a statue of gold. With such sentiments and predispositions, the
early passion of the Veronese lovers does not come within the canon
of Sir Walter Scott; and, as I have said, I do not think that Romeo
is designed merely as an exhibition of a man unfortunate in love.</p>

<p>I consider him to be meant as the character of an <em>unlucky</em> man,&mdash;a
man who, with the best views and fairest intentions, is perpetually
so unfortunate as to fail in every aspiration, and, while exerting himself
to the utmost in their behalf, to involve all whom he holds dearest
in misery and ruin. At the commencement of the play an idle quarrel
among some low retainers of the rival families produces a general
riot, with which he has nothing to do. He is not present from beginning
to end; the tumult has been so sudden and unexpected, that
his father is obliged to ask</p>

<p class="linequot">"What set this ancient quarrel new abroach?"</p>

<p>And yet it is this very quarrel which lays him prostrate in death by
his own hand, outside Capulet's monument, before the tragedy concludes.
While the fray was going on, he was nursing love-fancies,
and endeavouring to persuade himself that his heart was breaking for
Rosaline. How afflicting his passion must have been, we see by the
conundrums he makes upon it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;</div>
<div class="verse">Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;</div>
<div class="verse">Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></div>
<div class="verse">What is it else?&mdash;a madness most discreet,</div>
<div class="verse">A choking gall, and a preserving sweet."&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And so forth. The sorrows which we can balance in such trim antitheses
do not lie very deep. The time is rapidly advancing when his
sentences will be less sounding.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"It is my lady; oh, it is my love!</div>
<div class="verse">O that she knew she were!"&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>speaks more touchingly the state of his engrossed soul than all the
fine metaphors ever vented. The supercilious Spartans in the days
of their success prided themselves upon the laconic brevity of their
despatches to states in hostility or alliance with them. When they
were sinking before the Macedonians, another style was adopted; and
Philip observed that he had taught them to lengthen their monosyllables.
Real love has had a contrary effect upon Romeo. It has
abridged his swelling passages, and brought him to the language of
prose. The reason of the alteration is the same in both cases. The
brevity of the Spartans was the result of studied affectation. They
sought, by the insolence of threats obscurely insinuated in a sort of
demi-oracular language, to impose upon others,&mdash;perhaps they imposed
upon themselves,&mdash;an extravagant opinion of their mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
power. The secret was found out at last, and their anger bubbled
over in big words and lengthened sentences. The love of Rosaline is
as much affected on the part of Romeo, and it explodes in wire-drawn
conceits.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"When the devout religion of mine eye</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;</div>
<div class="verse">And those who often drown'd could never die,</div>

<div class="verse">One fairer than my love!&mdash;the all-seeing sun</div>
<div class="verse">Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is no wonder that a gentleman who is so clever as to be able to say
such extremely fine things, forgets, in the next scene, the devout religion
of his eye, without any apprehension of the transparent heretic
being burnt for a liar by the transmutation of tears into the flames of
an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auto da fe</i>. He is doomed to discover that love in his case is not
a madness most discreet when he defies the stars; there are then no
lines of magnificent declamation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!</div>
<div class="verse">Thou knowest my lodging: get me ink and paper,</div>
<div class="verse">And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nothing can be plainer prose than these verses. But how were
they delivered? Balthazar will tell us.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Pardon me, sir; I dare not leave you thus:</div>
<div class="verse">Your looks are pale and wild, and do import</div>
<div class="verse">Some misadventure."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, nothing can be more quiet than his final determination:</p>

<p class="linequot">"Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night."</p>

<p>It is plain Juliet,&mdash;unattended by any romantic epithet of love.
There is nothing about "Cupid's arrow," or "Dian's wit;" no honeyed
word escapes his lips,&mdash;nor again does any accent of despair. His mind
is so made up,&mdash;the whole course of the short remainder of his life so
unalterably fixed, that it is perfectly useless to think more about it
He has full leisure to reflect without disturbance upon the details of
the squalid penury which made him set down the poor apothecary as
a fit instrument for what now had become his "need;" and he offers
his proposition of purchasing that soon-speeding gear which is to
hurry him out of life, with the same business-like tone as if he were
purchasing a pennyworth of sugar-candy. When the apothecary
suggests the danger of selling such drugs, Romeo can reflect on
the folly of scrupling to sacrifice life when the holder of it is so poor
and unfortunate. Gallant and gay of appearance himself, he tells his
new-found acquaintance that bareness, famine, oppression, ragged
misery, the hollow cheek and the hungry eye, are fitting reasons
why death should be desired, not avoided; and with a cool philosophy
assures him that gold is worse poison than the compound which hurries
the life-weary taker out of the world. The language of desperation
cannot be more dismally determined. What did the apothecary think
of his customer as he pocketed the forty ducats? There you go, lad,&mdash;there
you go, he might have said,&mdash;there you go with that in your
girdle that, if you had the strength of twenty men, would straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
despatch you. Well do I know the use for which you intend it. To-morrow's
sun sees not you alive. And you philosophise to me on the
necessity of buying food and getting into flesh. You taunt my poverty,&mdash;you
laugh at my rags,&mdash;you bid me defy the law,&mdash;you tell
me the world is my enemy. It may be so, lad,&mdash;it may be so; but
less tattered is my garment than your heart,&mdash;less harassed by law
of one kind or another my pursuit than yours. What ails that
lad? I know not, neither do I care. But that he should moralise to
me on the hard lot which I experience,&mdash;that he, with those looks
and those accents, should fancy that I, amid my beggarly account of
empty boxes, am less happy than he,&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;it is something
to make one laugh. Ride your way, boy: I have your forty ducats
in my purse, and you my drug in your pocket. And the law!
Well! What can the executioner do worse to me in my penury and
my age than you have doomed for yourself in your youth and splendour.
I carry not my hangman in my saddle as I ride along. And
the curses which the rabble may pour upon my dying moments,&mdash;what
are they to the howling gurgle which, now rising from your heart, is
deafening your ears? Adieu, boy,&mdash;adieu!&mdash;and keep your philosophy
for yourself. Ho! ho! ho!</p>

<p>But had any other passion or pursuit occupied Romeo, he would
have been equally unlucky as in his love. Ill fortune has marked him
for her own. From beginning to end he intends the best; but his
interfering is ever for the worst. It is evident that he has not taken
any part in the family feud which divides Verona, and his first attachment
is to a lady of the antagonist house.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> To see that lady,&mdash;perhaps
to mark that he has had no share in the tumult of the morning,&mdash;he
goes to a ball given by Capulet, at which the suitor accepted by
the family is to be introduced to Juliet as her intended husband.
Paris is in every way an eligible match.</p>

<p class="linequot">"Verona's summer hath not such a flower."</p>

<p>He who has slain him addresses his corse as that of the "noble
County Paris," with a kindly remembrance that he was kinsman of a
friend slain in Romeo's own cause. Nothing can be more fervent, more
honourable, or more delicate than his devoted and considerate wooing.
His grief at the loss of Juliet is expressed in few words; but its
sincerity is told by his midnight and secret visit to the tomb of her
whom living he had honoured, and on whom, when dead, he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
restrain himself from lavishing funereal homage. Secure of the favour
of her father, no serious objection could be anticipated from herself.
When questioned by her mother, she readily promises obedience to
parental wishes, and goes to the ball determined to "look to like, if
looking liking move." Everything glides on in smooth current till the
appearance of him whose presence is deadly. Romeo himself is a
most reluctant visitor. He apprehends that the consequences of the
night's revels will be the vile forfeit of a despised life by an untimely
death, but submits to his destiny. He foresees that it is no wit to go,
but consoles himself with the reflection that he "means well in going
to this mask." His intentions, as usual, are good; and, as usual, their
consequences are ruinous.</p>

<p>He yields to his passion, and marries Juliet. For this hasty act he
has the excuse that the match may put an end to the discord between
the families. Friar Lawrence hopes that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi8">"this alliance may so happy prove</div>
<div class="verse">To turn your households' rancour into love."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It certainly has that effect in the end of the play, but it is by the suicidal
deaths of the flower and hope of both families. Capulet and
Montague tender, in a gloomy peace the hands of friendship, over the
untimely grave of the poor sacrifices to their enmity. Had he met
her elsewhere than in her father's house, he might have succeeded in
a more prosperous love. But there his visit is looked upon by the
professed duellist Tybalt, hot from the encounter of the morning, and
enraged that he was baulked of a victim, as an intrusion and an insult.
The fiery partisan is curbed with much difficulty by his uncle; and
withdraws, his flesh trembling with wilful choler, determined to wreak
vengeance at the first opportunity on the intruder. It is not long
before the opportunity offers. Vainly does Romeo endeavour to pacify
the bullying swordsman,&mdash;vainly does he protest that he loves the
name of Capulet,&mdash;vainly does he decline the proffered duel. His
good intentions are again doomed to be frustrated. There stands by his
side as mad-blooded a spirit as Tybalt himself, and Mercutio, all unconscious
of the reasons why Romeo refuses to fight, takes up the abandoned
quarrel. The star of the unlucky man is ever in the ascendant.
His ill-omened interference slays his friend. Had he kept quiet, the
issue might have been different; but the power that had the steerage
of his course had destined that the uplifting of his sword was to be
the signal of death to his very friend. And when the dying Mercutio
says, "Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your
arm;" he can only offer the excuse, which is always true, and always
unavailing, "I thought all for the best." All his visions of reconciliation
between the houses are dissipated. How can he now avoid fighting
with Tybalt? His best friend lies dead, slain in his own quarrel,
through his own accursed intermeddling; and the swaggering victor,
still hot from the slaughter, comes back to triumph over the dead.
Who with the heart and spirit of a man could under such circumstances
refrain from exclaiming,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Away to heaven, respective lenity!</div>
<div class="verse">And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Vanish gentle breath, calm words, knees humbly bowed!&mdash;his weapon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in an instant glitters in the blazing sun; and as with a lightning flash,&mdash;as
rapidly and resistlessly,&mdash;before Benvolio can pull his sword from the
scabbard, Tybalt, whom his kindred deemed a match for twenty men,
is laid by the side of him who but a moment before had been the victim
of his blade. What avails the practised science of the duellist,
the gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause!&mdash;how
weak is the immortal passado, or the punto reverso, the hay, or all
the other learned devices of Vincent Saviola, against the whirlwind
rage of a man driven to desperation by all that can rouse fury or stimulate
hatred! He sees the blood of his friend red upon the ground;
the accents of gross and unprovoked outrage ring in his ears; the
perverse and obstinate insolence of a bravo confident in his skill, and
depending upon it to insure him impunity, has marred his hopes; and
the butcher of the silk button has no chance against the demon which
he has evoked. "A la stoccata" carries it not away in this encounter;
but Romeo exults not in his death. He stands amazed, and is with
difficulty hurried off, exclaiming against the constant fate which perpetually
throws him in the way of misfortune. Well, indeed, may
Friar Lawrence address him by the title of "thou fearful man!"&mdash;as a
man whose career through life is calculated to inspire terror. Well
may he say to him that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,</div>
<div class="verse">And thou art wedded to calamity."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And slight is the attention which Romeo pays to the eloquent arguments
by which it is proved that he had every reason to consider himself
happy. When the friar assures him that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"A pack of blessings lights upon thy back,</div>
<div class="verse">Happiness courts thee in her best array,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the nurse may think it a discourse of learning and good counsel, fit to
detain an enraptured auditor all the night. Romeo feels it in his case
to be an idle declamation, unworthy of an answer.</p>

<p>The events which occur during his enforced absence, the haste of
Paris to be wedded, the zeal of old Capulet in promoting the
wishes of his expected son-in-law, the desperate expedient of the
sleeping-draught,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the accident which prevented the delivery of the
friar's letter, the officious haste of Balthazar to communicate the
tidings of Juliet's burial, are all matters out of his control. But the
mode of his death is chosen by himself; and in that he is as unlucky
as in everything else. Utterly loathing life, the manner of his leaving
it must be instantaneous. He stipulates that the poison by which he
is to die shall not be slow of effect. He calls for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi4">"such soon-speeding gear</div>
<div class="verse">As will disperse itself through all the veins,</div>
<div class="verse">That the life-weary taker may fall dead."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>He leaves himself no chance of escape. Instant death is in his
hand; and, thanking the true apothecary for the quickness of his
drugs, he scarcely leaves himself a moment with a kiss to die. If
he had been less in a hurry,&mdash;if he had not felt it impossible to delay
posting off to Verona for a single night,&mdash;if his riding had been less
rapid, or his medicine less sudden in its effect, he might have lived.
The friar was at hand to release Juliet from her tomb the very instant
after the fatal phial had been emptied. That instant was enough:
the unlucky man had effected his purpose just when there was still a
chance that things might be amended. Those who wrote the scene
between Romeo and Juliet which is intended to be pathetic, after her
awakening and before his death, quite mistake the character of the
hero of the play. I do not blame them for their poetry, which is as
good as that of second-rate writers of tragedy in general; and think
them, on the whole, deserving of our commendation for giving us
an additional proof how unable clever men upon town are to follow
the conceptions of genius. Shakspeare, if he thought it consistent
with the character which he had with so much deliberation framed,
could have written a parting scene at least as good as that with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
his tragedy has been supplied; but he saw the inconsistency, though
his unasked assistants did not. They tell us they did it to consult
popular taste. I do not believe them. I am sure that popular taste
would approve of a recurrence to the old play in all its parts; but a
harlotry play-actor might think it hard upon him to be deprived of a
"point," pointless as that point may be.</p>

<p>Haste is made a remarkable characteristic of Romeo,&mdash;because it
is at once the parent and the child of uniform misfortune. As from
the acorn springs the oak, and from the oak the acorn, so does the
temperament that inclines to haste predispose to misadventure, and
a continuance of misadventure confirms the habit of haste. A man
whom his rashness has made continually unlucky, is strengthened in
the determination to persevere in his rapid movements by the very
feeling that the "run" is against him, and that it is of no use to think.
In the case of Romeo, he leaves it all to the steerage of Heaven, <i>i. e.</i>
to the heady current of his own passions; and he succeeds accordingly.
All through the play care is taken to show his impatience.
The very first word he speaks indicates that he is anxious for the
quick passage of time.</p>


<p class="blockquot">"<span class="speaker">Ben.</span> Good morrow, cousin.<br />
<span class="speaker">Rom.</span><span class="in6">Is the day so young?</span><br />
<span class="speaker">Ben.</span> But new struck nine.<br />
<span class="speaker">Rom.</span> <span class="in6">Ay me, sad hours seem long."</span></p>

<p>The same impatience marks his speech in the moment of death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"O true apothecary,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy drugs are quick!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>From his first words to his last the feeling is the same. The lady of
his love, even in the full swell of her awakened affections, cannot
avoid remarking that his contract is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,</div>
<div class="verse">Too like the lightning, which does cease to be</div>
<div class="verse">Ere one can say, It lightens."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When he urges his marriage on the friar,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"<span class="speaker">Rom.</span> O let us home: I stand on sudden haste.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="speaker">Friar.</span> Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The metaphors put into his mouth are remarkable for their allusions
to abrupt and violent haste. He wishes that he may die</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"As violently as hasty powder fired</div>
<div class="verse">Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When he thinks that Juliet mentions his name in anger, it is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"as if that name,</div>
<div class="verse">Shot from the deadly level of a gun,</div>
<div class="verse">Did murder her."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When Lawrence remonstrates with him on his violence, he compares
the use to which he puts his wit to</p>

<p class="linequot">"Powder in a skilless soldier's flask;"</p>

<p>and tells him that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Violent delights have violent ends,</div>
<div class="verse">And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,</div>
<div class="verse">Which, as they kiss, consume."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>Lightning, flame, shot, explosion, are the favourite parallels to the
conduct and career of Romeo. Swift are his loves; as swift to enter
his thought, the mischief which ends them for ever. Rapid have been
all the pulsations of his life; as rapid, the determination which decides
that they shall beat no more.</p>

<p>A gentleman he was in heart and soul. All his habitual companions
love him: Benvolio and Mercutio, who represent the young
gentlemen of his house, are ready to peril their lives, and to strain all
their energies, serious or gay, in his service. His father is filled with
an anxiety on his account so delicate, that he will not venture to interfere
with his son's private sorrows, while he desires to discover
their source, and if possible to relieve them. The heart of his mother
bursts in his calamity; the head of the rival house bestows upon
him the warmest panegyrics; the tutor of his youth sacrifices everything
to gratify his wishes; his servant, though no man is a hero to
his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de chambre</i>, dares not remonstrate with him on his intentions,
even when they are avowed to be savage-wild,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"More fierce, and more inexorable far,</div>
<div class="verse">Than empty tigers or the roaring sea,"&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but with an eager solicitude he breaks his commands by remaining as
close as he can venture, to watch over his safety. Kind is he to all.
He wins the heart of the romantic Juliet by his tender gallantry:
the worldly-minded nurse praises him for being as gentle as a lamb.
When it is necessary or natural that the Prince or Lady Montague
should speak harshly of him, it is done in his absence. No words of
anger or reproach are addressed to his ears save by Tybalt; and from
him they are in some sort a compliment, as signifying that the self-chosen
prize-fighter of the opposing party deems Romeo the worthiest
antagonist of his blade. We find that he fights two blood-stained
duels, but both are forced upon him; the first under circumstances
impossible of avoidance, the last after the humblest supplications to
be excused.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"O begone!</div>
<div class="verse">By Heaven, I love thee better than myself,</div>
<div class="verse">For I came hither armed against myself.</div>
<div class="verse">Stay not; begone!&mdash;live, and hereafter say</div>
<div class="verse">A madman's mercy bade thee run away."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>With all the qualities and emotions which can inspire affection and
esteem,&mdash;with all the advantages that birth, heaven, and earth could
at once confer,&mdash;with the most honourable feelings and the kindliest
intentions,&mdash;he is eminently an unlucky man. The record of his
actions in the play before us does not extend to the period of a week;
but we feel that there is no dramatic straining to shorten their course.
Everything occurs naturally and probably. It was his concluding
week; but it tells us all his life. Fortune was against him; and
would have been against him, no matter what might have been his
pursuit. He was born to win battles, but to lose campaigns. If we
desired to moralize with the harsh-minded satirist, who never can be
suspected of romance, we should join with him in extracting as
a moral from the play</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Nullum habes numen, si sit prudentia; sed te</div>
<div class="verse">Nos facimus, Fortuna, deam, c&oelig;loquê locamus;"</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>and attribute the mishaps of Romeo, not to want of fortune, but of
prudence. Philosophy and poetry differ not in essentials, and the
stern censure of Juvenal is just. But still, when looking on the timeless
tomb of Romeo, and contemplating the short and sad career
through which he ran, we cannot help recollecting his mourning
words over his dying friend, and suggest as an inscription over the
monument of the luckless gentleman,</p>

<p class="linequot">"Aspettar' e non venire!"</p>

<p>The Sunday after Darby <em>lingeringly</em> started, I began to think it
would be just as well to make "assurance doubly sure;" so I despatched
a letter by post to my friend at Bally&mdash;&mdash;, conveying similar instructions
and advice to those contained in that entrusted to "<em>the
running footman</em>" of my establishment. In three days I received a
satisfactory answer, so I was at rest upon that point; but, as to Darby,
I was quite at a loss. I turned over and over in my mind the various
mishaps that might have befallen him by the way; but all to no
purpose. I called up Eileen, and asked her what she thought about
it. Her replies, mixed up, as they were, with her wild immoderate
laughter, afforded me nothing beyond a sympathy with her mirth, which
certainly was most infective. Reader, I am not a portrait-painter; but,
nevertheless, I will attempt to give you an outline of Eileen. In the
first place, she was a poor girl, (else she would not have been <em>my</em> servant,)
born of honest parents; but, if fate had placed her in a higher
sphere, she had natural accomplishments enough to have graced it,&mdash;namely,
youth, beauty, and health,&mdash;and, beyond these, an intellectual,
though uneducated, refinement of thought, when, <em>by chance</em>, she
was serious; for gaiety seemed to be an indispensable element of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
being. She was eighteen years of age,&mdash;well, what do I say?&mdash;beautifully
formed, had eyes like violets, cheeks like roses, hair, when it
was dishevelled (despite Goldsmith's satire), like a weeping willow in
a sunset, and&mdash;but, hold! I must not go further, lest I be suspected
of being enamoured of the original; so I will give up the remaining
parts of the picture, and leave them to your imagination!</p>

<p>The Friday after Darby's setting out I was sitting in my room,
very quietly poring over something or other of no importance,&mdash;I forget
exactly what, but I think it was some speech in the House of
Lords,&mdash;when a knock at the door agreeably disturbed me from an
incipient somnolency, occasioned by a new and unprofitable line of
reading.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said I. "Who is it? and what do you want?"</p>

<p>"It's only <em>me</em>, sir," said Eileen, laughing, as usual. "There's a
cr<em>a</em>ther below that wants to speak to you, sir."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" said I.</p>

<p>"I don't well know, sir," replied she; "but I think he's some relation
to poor Darby, that ye sent to Bally&mdash;&mdash; last Friday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Oh! then send him up; he may account in some way for the extraordinary
absence of his relative, said I.</p>

<p>"Sure, an' it's myself, an' no relation at all," shouted Darby from
below, indignantly.</p>

<p>"<em>Oh! widdy-eelish!</em>" cried Eileen, breaking out into her hearty
wild laugh, that was sure to set at defiance anything like gravity!</p>

<p>"Come up, Darby," said I. "I thought we should never have seen
you again."</p>

<p>"Troth, an' the same thing came into my head more than oncet,
masther. What the divil are ye laughin' at, honey?" said he (entering
the room) to Eileen, who still continued her most boisterous mirth.</p>

<p>"Go down stairs, Evelina," said I, "and leave Darby and me
alone!"</p>

<p>She did so; but whispered something in his ear as she passed,
which made him so furious that I thought he would have knocked her
down, had she not adroitly escaped him by shutting the door after
her, and holding the handle on the outside so tightly that his efforts
to open it and follow her were abandoned in a moment as fruitless.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of all this?" said I, severely. "Did you
mean to strike the girl?"</p>

<p>"Strike the <em>caileen</em>, yir honour? Oh, the Lord forbid! but, if I
cotch her upon the stairs out o' yir honor's sight, maybe I wudn't
give her cherry-lips a <em>pogue</em> (yir honor knows what a <em>pogue</em> is) that
wud drive her sweetheart crazy for a month o' Sundays!"</p>

<p>"Where have you been all this while?" inquired I, not willing to
notice his speech.</p>

<p>"Oh then, sure!" said he, in a most mournful tone, "masther,
I've had the divil's own time of it, sir, since you were so unfortunate
as to part with me, yir honor, on that same journey to Bally&mdash;Bally&mdash;Bally&mdash;bad
luck to it! what do they call it?"</p>

<p>"What has happened?" inquired I, anxiously, thinking he might
have later news than my post-letter of three days before had conveyed.</p>

<p>"Happened, yir honour! to who?" said Darby, with a wild look of
concern. "I hope the family, Christians, bastes, and all, not barrin'
the pig that had the measles, are in good health, and well to do as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
when I left them. Has the bracket hin taken to standin' upon one
leg yit, sir, since she lost the other through that baste of a bull-dog
belongin' to the parson? I'd lay three of her eggs she'll never forget
the affront he put upon her then!"</p>

<p>"We are all well here," said I; "but give me some account of
what has befallen you on your journey, that delayed you so long."</p>

<p>"Troth, an' I'll tell ye, masther," replied Darby, "in no time.
Have ye five minutes to spare, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "let me hear."</p>

<p>"Well then, sir," commenced he, "you may remimber that it was
on a Friday you took l<em>a</em>ve of me&mdash;last Friday of all&mdash;Friday was
never a <em>looky</em> day by <em>say</em> or by land: ye see, I didn't go far afore I
met with a disappointment, for I met a berrin' comin' right <em>fornenst</em>
me&mdash;what <em>coud</em> I do but turn back, in dacency, with it?&mdash;and, after
I'd <em>keen'd</em> about a mile with the mourners, I made bould to ax who
was the body that was makin' a blackberry <em>ov</em> himself."</p>

<p>"A blackberry!" interrupted I.</p>

<p>"Yes, yir honor, a blackberry," replied Darby: "do ye know that,
let it shoot never so far, it's sure to come back as near as it can to
the root of it where it first started; and so arn't we all blackberries?
As the priest says on Ash-<em>Wendsday</em>, "Remember, man, you are but
dust, and into dust you must return." Now, I've known bigger <em>dusts</em>
in their lifetime than they were turned out of afterward, when they
took to studyin' astron<em>a</em>my with</p>

<div class="verse">And the tip of their nose,</div>
<div class="verse">Turn'd up to the roots of the daisies!'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But, whose berrin' should it be, after all, but ould Jemmy Cullen, the
piper's! Ye know Jemmy Cullen, yir honour? him that used to play
the organ on the pipes at high-mass durin' Christmas an' Easter. Oh!
he was the boy to lilt at a weddin' or a wake! but, p<em>a</em>ce be width 'im&mdash;God
rest his sowl! as I said when I saw the <em>scragh</em> put over him
for the first time. Well, ye know, yir honor, that oncet upon the
same road width them I coudn't do more nor less than wet our clay
together; so, after walkin' the corpse three times round the churchyard
of Glassin-oge&mdash;Were ye ever berried there, sir?&mdash;I mane,
wud ye like to be berried there, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not just yet," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, the Lord forbid, sir!" cried Darby. "I didn't mane that,
by no manes. God send ye many days, and <em>prosprous</em> ones too!
But there's a taste in chusin' a berrin'-ground as well as there is in a
drawin'-room," said he, looking around him.</p>

<p>"So there may be," said I; "but that is only the whim or notion
of a living man. When he dies, all churchyards are the same to
him; he then can have no considerations about the matter."</p>

<p>"That's all very true, sir," replied Darby; "but would ye like to
be burnt after the breath was out o' ye?"</p>

<p>"I could have neither liking nor disliking," answered I; "for I
should be an insensible mass of matter."</p>

<p>"But mightn't yir ghost, sir, like to see ye were comfortably provided
for? I mane yir honor's dead body that's alive an' in good
health now, an' long may it continue so!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! never mind," said I; "neither you nor I, Darby, know
much about those things; so go on with your story."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, sir!" said Darby, and resumed. "I was sayin', sir, as
how we went to wet our clay together at the '<em>Three Jolly Pigeons</em>.'
Yir honor knows the 'Three Jolly Pigeons,' facing the ould hawthorn
o' Goldsmith, in the village of <span class="smcap">Auburn</span> hard by here, eh?
Sure, an' I've heer'd as much as how they want to take the merits
of the whole place to themselves over in England somewhere, as if it
couldn't spake plainly for itself that it was bred and born here in ould
Ireland ages ago! Isn't the '<em>Desarted Village</em>' a b<em>u</em>tiful histhory,
masther? Lame Kelly, the poet, says, it bates the world for makin'
the heart soft. It's myself that never passes the spot without a tear
in my eye, like a widow's pig, as the sayin' is. There's the ruins of
the d<em>a</em>cent church on the hill all in b<em>u</em>tiful repair to this hour, and
the parson's house, and the schoolmaster Tom Allen's, and the
common, and the pond, width the geese upon it still, as if it was only
yistherday, an' the ould hawthorn&mdash;bad <em>look</em> to their taste that built
a stone wall round about it like a <em>jail</em>! What did the blessed tree
ever do that it should be put in pound in that manner o' way?"</p>

<p>Gentle shade of <span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>! amongst the many tributes to thy
immortal genius, receive kindly the simple but honest homage of
poor Darby. He may not be able to appreciate thee in all thy varied
splendour of moral and intellectual worth; but he has a heart full
of benevolence like thine own, and, although a poor Irish serf, has
feeling and fancy enough to reverence the spots thou hast consecrated
by the thousand-spelled wand of thy muse!</p>

<p>"Darby," said I, "I promised you something on your return
(though you did not come back as soon as I expected); there's a
guinea for you."</p>

<p>"Augh, thin, may the light of Heaven break yir last sleep!" said
Darby; "but isn't it too much, masther?"</p>

<p>"You are welcome to it," said I; "go on with your story."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, sir!" replied he. "Whereabouts was I when I left
off?"</p>

<p>"Just where you are now," said I.</p>

<p>"Beggin' yir honor's pardon, I think I was at the 'Three Jolly
Pigeons.'"</p>

<p>"Be it so," said I, "go on."</p>

<p>"Well, as I was sayin', when we damp'd the grief a trifle at the
<em>sheebeen</em> width a drop of the rale <em>stone turf</em>, I takes up the kish again;
but first I put my hand in the straw to see if the <em>dog-een</em> was comfortable,
and there he was to be sure, warm an' nice as a new-laid
egg: so, wishin' the rest of the company every amusement in life, I
set out on my travels agen. Just as I was in the doorway, Ned Coffey,
the <em>whisperer</em>,&mdash;ye know Ned Coffey, yir honor, that brakes in
the wild <em>coults</em> width a charm he's got? Well, anyhow, if he didn't
laugh so as if his mother was a horse; but I never minded him, only
went on wonderin' to myself what cud av' made him so humoursome
at a berrin'. Well, never mind that, I went on beautifully for a time,
as good as an hour an' a half, when, all of a suddent, leppin' a ditch,
the hayband I had acrass my breast bruk, and let the <em>clieve</em> fall <em>clane</em> in
the dirty puddle. 'Oh, <em>hannamandhioul</em>!' says I, 'what'll the masther
say to this?' The words were scarce past my lips when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<em>squake</em> that 'ud av' split the ears of a pitcher came out o' the <em>clieve</em>,
an' after that a gruntin', such as I never <em>heer'd</em> come from mortal man
afore, barrin' it was a pig under a gate!"</p>

<p>"What could it have been?" inquired I, affecting a grave concern;
"it was not my dog Squib, surely?"</p>

<p>"Who the <em>nagers</em> else could it be?" said Darby. "Only, after
crassing myself three times, and turnin' up the basket wid' my <em>horse</em>,
I found he was bewitched into the shape of a porker, as purty a
young pig sure enough, about seven weeks ould, as I'd wish to clap
eyes on."</p>

<p>"A pig!" exclaimed I. "Why, he returned home that very night
in his own shape."</p>

<p>"Well then, see that, now," said Darby, "thuv', for my own part,
I think it was all Ned Coffey's doin; but, be that as it may, I was
never so frightened in all my born days, for I tuk to my heels, an'
was out o' sight in no time, like a <em>haro</em>! tho' I hadn't far to go to be
that same, for it was pitch-dark; so, to keep myself company, I began
singin'</p>

<div class="verse">As tall and as <em>strate</em> as a shaverman's pole!'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>'Augh! thin, <em>was</em> she?' says a voice that I cudn't see, tho' 'twas close
to my left ear! 'Who's there?' says I. 'Where?' says it, on th'
other side. 'Anywhere,' says I, 'to plaze ye;' and wid that I fell
into a could sweat, for I began to think it was Mihilmas Eve, an'
divil a grain of salt I had about me to keep me from harm! 'Crass
o' Christ on us!' says I, 'an' God bless ye!' for I thought it was one
of the good people, yir honor! so I made up my mind to get in-<em>doors</em>
as soon as I could. But that wasn't so aisy as wishin', for there
wasn't a village nearer than five miles, nor a cabin by the way-side.
At last I spies a light at a distance in the fields aff the road, and
away we set, I and my <em>horse</em>, full gallup. Oh! many's the ditch we
cleared without seein'; but still, never a bit did we come nearer to
the light! 'Is it a <em>Will</em>,' says I to myself, 'or a <em>Jack</em>?' an' wid that
out it goes on a suddent, and l<em>a</em>ves me up to my chin in a bog.
Augh! then, hadn't I a cruel time of it there? I was, for all the
world, like a <em>flay</em> on Father Fogarty's pock-mark'd nose, or a blind
horse in a tan-yard,&mdash;no sooner out o' one hole than into another!
At last I got upon dry land, and wasn't I thankful for that same? for
I got hoult ov a stone wall that directed me straight on to a gate that
was only hasp'd; so I opened it, an' let myself out upon a <em>rodeiene</em>,
that I knew by the tracks o' the wheels; so, turnin' myself round
three times for <em>look</em>, (and bad <em>look</em> it was,) I steps out into a ditch
that was handy by the way-side,&mdash;for it was acrass the <em>rodeiene</em> I
went 'stead of lengthways either up or down; but how could I do
betther in the dark? Well, afther a while floundherin' about like a
litther of pups in a bag, I got on my feet agen clane out o' the mud,
shiverin' an' shakin' as if I had Jack Nulty's ague 'pon me! 'Well,'
says I to myself, 'it was <em>looky</em> I stopp'd to have a drop at the berrin',
or I'd av' nothin' to keep the could out o' me now! It was Providence
as well as dacency that put it into my head!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you had not stopped," said I, "you would not have been overtaken
by the night, and exposed to such a disagreeable accident!"</p>

<p>"Well, sure, yir honor," replied Darby, "somethin' else might av'
happened, an' who knows but it might 'a been worse?&mdash;there's no
sayin' or accountin' for such things. Well, be that as it may, I began
to walk on, feelin' afore me width my <em>horse</em> (that never forsook me
all the time) whether I was in the right road or not, till at last I
comes all ov a suddent into the middle o' the town o' Lanesbro', with
<em>raal</em> candles (none ov yir <em>wisps</em> or <em>lantherns</em>) burnin' in every window.
Maybe I didn't know where I was then! So, mountin' my horse, sir,
strad-legs, away I <em>canther'd</em>, blessin' my stars that I got on my journey
so well and so far, width only a wettin' in the bog-holes an'
ditches, and a scratch or two on my hands an' cheeks, that I made
nothin' ov. 'Where will we put up for the night,' says I to my
horse; but yir honor knows the <em>crathur</em> cudn't answer me: so I tuk
my own advice, an' went sthraight to 'The Cat and Bagpipes.' 'Will
I get a lodgin' here the night?' says I to the lan'lady.&mdash;'Who are
ye?' says she.&mdash;'Who am I!' I says; 'I'm yir honor's servant, on a
mission,' says I, mentionin' yir name, masther.&mdash;'Can ye pay for a
bed?' says she.&mdash;'Can money do it?' says I.&mdash;'To be sure,' says she.&mdash;'Then,
look here,' says I; an' wid that I show'd her four and sixpence&mdash;for
I only spent sixpence at the berrin'.&mdash;'Go into the
kitchen,' says she, 'an' I'll see what I can do for ye.'&mdash;'Thank ye,
ma'am,' says I. So I goes my ways into the kitchen, and sits down
by the hob. That was very agreeable for a time; but, when I dried
myself, an' wanted to go to bed after a drop or two, how d'ye think
they sarved me? only sure, yir honor, by putting me in bed with a
<em>furrener</em>,&mdash;nothin' more nor less than a <em>black</em>, savin' yir presence,&mdash;for
it was the <em>fair</em> night o' the town, and beds were scarce, an' not to be
had for love or money; so I was <em>oblidged</em> to sleep double, plaze ye, sir,
in a two-bedded room. They tould me he was only a <em>sweep</em>; but he
turned out to be a <em>raal</em> black, to my sorrow!"</p>

<p>"In what way?" inquired I.</p>

<p>"Oh! in many ways, sir," replied Darby. "First and forenenst, he
prevented me takin' my natural rest afore midnight; for I took a
Bible oath on a child's catechism that I wouldn't enther the room
where he was afore the <em>good people</em> were gone to roost; for who
knows what they might have made of me? Lord bless ye! they'd av'
turn'd every hair o' my head into pump-handles, if they liked, afore
morn! so I thought it best to sit up a while, an' kick up a bit ov a
dance in the kitchen width Katheen the maid, an' two or three other
<em>spreesans</em> that were inclined for the fun; an' fine sport we had, to be
sure, to the tune of '<em>The Hare in the Corn</em>,' and '<em>Roger de Cuvverly</em>,'&mdash;did
ye ever trip it to 'Roger de Cuvverly,' yir honor? Oh! it's
an illigant cure for the gout!"</p>

<p>"I never dance," said I.</p>

<p>"An' more's the sorrow!" said Darby, "for ye've a fine pair o'
legs o' yir own, an' it's a pity that a lame piper shudn't be the better
o' them some night or other!"</p>

<p>"We'll see about that," said I; "holiday-time is coming."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, and long life to yir honor! Will ye give us the
barn, sir, for a hop width the girls a-comin' Christmas?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "and a barrel of ale into the bargain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! then won't that be illigant?" said Darby, cutting an anticipatory
caper on the carpet. "An' won't yir honor dance yirself,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I have said already that I never dance," replied I. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, imm<em>a</em>diately," said he, and continued. "Well, after a
bit we had a game o' blindman's buff, an', to be sure, <em>raal</em> fun it was
while it lasted, and that was till we got into the little hours; an'
many's the trick we play'd one another, till myself felt the miller
throwin' dust in my eyes; so, givin' Katheen the wink that I was
goin' aff slily, I tould her to call me early in the morn, an' left the
party to themselves. I soon tuk aff me, an' was asleep in no time;
but in less than half an hour I had a most wonderful <em>drame</em>. I
thought I was the first paycock that ever wore a tail in Paradise;
an' maybe I wasn't proud o' myself, s<em>a</em>ted in the tree of knowledge,
width Adam an' Eve, <em>ketchin'</em> flies width their mouth open, lookin' at
me for wonder. 'Arrah! <em>cushlah!</em>' says Adam to his wife; 'isn't it
a b<em>u</em>tiful sight?'&mdash;'Troth, an' it is,' says she; 'avick! I hope he
won't fly away, for I'd like to make a pet ov 'im. I'll just step in<em>doors</em>
for the blundherbuss!' When I came to this part o' my <em>drame</em>,
the blood o' me ran could, an' I couldn't think what was the matther
width me, barrin' it was the night-<em>mare</em>; but it was no such
thing, for I turned on th' other side, and thought then I was a race-<em>horse</em>
on the Curragh of Kildare, an' yir honor clappin' spurs into me
within twenty yards of the winnin' post! Well, that was better than
t'other; but, as I was dr<em>a</em>ming in this fashion, I began to think
they'd never call me at all, when Katheen, yir honor,&mdash;the purty
little girl, sir, that kept me up so late the night afore, dancin' with her
in the back-kitchen,&mdash;gave a <em>puck</em> at the door with her fist, that sent
in one of the panels, and dumb-foundered quite an ould clock on the
back of it, that was pointin' width its two hands to some hour last
year. 'Who the divil's that?' says I.&mdash;'It's only me,' says she, with
a voice like a sp<em>a</em>king-trumpet, or a chorus of ganders. (I think the
crather had a could upon her.) 'Arrah! d'ye never mane to l<em>a</em>ve off
sleepin'?'&mdash;'What o'clock is it, alanna!' says I.&mdash;'Oh! the same hour
it was this time yisterday, I suppose,' says she, 'for the clock is
<em>down</em>.'&mdash;'Faith! it is,' says I, nate and cl<em>a</em>ne upon the <em>flooer</em>; 'but
never mind that, the sun's <em>up</em>!'&mdash;'Ay,' says Katheen, 'this two
hours or more.'&mdash;'And so wud I,' says I, 'if I had as far to travel in
the day as he has!'&mdash;'Augh!' said Katheen, 'you lazy <em>puckaun</em>, did
ye never hear that the early bird <em>ketches</em> the worm?'&mdash;'Troth, an' I
did,' says I, 'putting on my shirt; 'but what an <em>ummadhaun</em> the
worm must be to get up afore him.'&mdash;'An' over an' above,' says
Katheen, 'the man that was on the road betimes in the mornin'
found a purse.'&mdash;'Ay!' says I, 'but the poor divil that lost it was
there first.'&mdash;'Oh, the <em>divil</em> be width ye! stop there till ye're stiff
av ye like,' said Katheen, and run down stairs afore I could say Jack
Robison. Well, then, yir honor, I was soon drest an' up; so, as
I'd <em>ped</em> my way <em>the night</em>, I had <em>nawthin'</em> to do but pass clane through
the kitchen in the mornin', an' take to the road agen, when I saw
Katheen a-lightin' the fire. I just stepped towards her for a kiss
<em>a-dhurrus</em>, when she cried murther in Irish, loud enough to waken
the whole house; so I thought I'd have nothin' more to do width her
this time, and went my ways p<em>a</em>ceably. It was a fine mornin', barrin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the mist, that wudn't let ye see a yard afore ye at a time, an', to be
sure, I <em>kep</em> it up at a fine rate 'till I r<em>a</em>ched the town of Kilcronan.
But, what d'ye think happened me there, yir honor?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I cannot say," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll tell ye, sir. As I was passin' by a pawnbroker's
that was settin' out his goods for sale, what did I see but a lookin'-glass
starin' me in the face, an' a blackamoor's head in the middle of
it. Well, I look'd, and look'd, and look'd agen, but divil a bit was it
like me; so, turnin' 'pon my heel, 'Bad look to them!' says I, 'they've
woke the <em>wrong man</em>;' for yir honor remimbers that I slept width a
<em>furrener</em> the night afore, and left orders to be called early; so I had
nothin' for it but run back agen as hard as I could lay foot to ground
for twelve honest miles; and lucky sure it was that the fog was so
thick as ye could cut it with a knife, or I'd av' 'ad the divil's own
time of it on the way. But, as it happened, I met nobody that knew
me, 'cept blind M'Diarmot the sign-painther."</p>

<p>"Sign-painter!" exclaimed I. "I thought you said he was
blind."</p>

<p>"Augh! sure it was afore he lost his eye-sight," said Darby, "that
he was the most illigant sign-painther in the county. Didn't he paint
<em>The Pig and Thrush</em> for Mat Sleven; an' <em>The Three Blacks</em>, that
ye'd take for two twins, they're so like one anuther; and <em>The Red
Herrin'</em> for Pat Gaveny in the market, that look'd so <em>salt</em> it made yir
mouth wather to that degree, that ye cudn't help, passin' by, goin' in
to have a drop. Oh! it brought powers of custom anyhow!"</p>

<p>"How did he lose his eyes?" inquired I.</p>

<p>"He didn't lose them at all, sir," replied Darby, "only the sight o'
<em>one</em> o' them, (for he never had th' other,) an' that was all through
Molly, <em>the Lump</em>, that advised him, (bad win' to her!) to use cr<em>a</em>me
when he had a could upon his intellects after the <em>typus</em>; so he mistuk
a pot o' white lead for the same, one evenin' that he had a drop
too much, and fairly painted himself blind; for from that hour to this
he can't see a hole in a forty-fut laddher. And more's the pity, for
he had plenty o' <em>drawin'</em> about the counthry to do; an' now his dog
has got into the <em>line</em> ov it for him, the crathur! Well, anyhow,
knowin' he was a jidge o' colours, I ax'd him to feel my face, an' tell
me what was the matther width it; so he puts his hand upon me, an'
may I never die, masther, if it didn't turn as black as a crow as soon
as he drew it acrass my cheek! 'Well,' says I, 'this b<em>a</em>tes cock-fightin'!'
But I soon found out the trick they played me; for
M'Diarmot, when he smelt his hand, said there was s<em>u</em>t and goose-gr<em>a</em>se
upon it. So ye see, yir honor, the truth was, they blackened
my face in the kitchen afore they put me to sleep with the black, that
I mightn't know which was myself in the mornin'. May they live till
the ind o' the world, that the divil may have a race after them, say I,
for that same!"</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="THE_DUEL" id="THE_DUEL"></a>THE DUEL.</h2>


<p>I was educated, said a French gentleman whom I met in quarantine,
at Poitiers, though Lusignan is my native town.</p>

<p>Poitiers is well known to the antiquary as having possessed a
Roman amphitheatre, of which, however, when I was at that university,
only a vault, supposed to have been a cage for the wild beasts,
remained. This cage, from the solidity of the masonry, and the
enormous size of the blocks, seemed indestructible, but was not so;
for when I last visited Poitiers, and asked for the key of the cavern,
I found that it no longer existed, and that on the site had been constructed
the inn of the "Trois Pelerins."</p>

<p>It is a stone's throw from the Salle d'Armes, a place with which I
had been better acquainted than with the schools. To revive my
ancient recollection, I entered the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle</i>, and found there an inhabitant
of the town whom I had known at college. He proposed that we
should dine together at the "Trois Pelerins;" and, after drinking as
good a bottle of wine as it afforded, he related to me what a few days
before, in the very room where we were sitting, had happened at a
dinner of the collegians. It was ordered for twelve; but, one of the
party having invited a friend, the number swelled to thirteen.</p>

<p>It is said that superstition supplies the place of religion; I have
observed this to be the case with the most sceptical of my acquaintance:
and thus this number thirteen occasioned some remarks, and
the stranger was looked upon with no very favourable eye, and considered
as a supernumerary, who brought with him ill luck.</p>

<p>One of the set at last summoned resolution enough to say,</p>

<p>"I do not dine thirteen."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said another.</p>

<p>"Nor I," was repeated on all sides.</p>

<p>The guest, naturally embarrassed at this rudeness, got up, and was
about to retire, when Alfonse, to whom he came as an <em>umbra</em>, proposed
an ingenious expedient for doing away with the evil augury,
and said,</p>

<p>"There is one way of annulling the proverb that threatens death
in the course of the year to one of a party of thirteen; that way is,
to decide which of us shall fight a duel this evening, or to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Done!" cried all the students at a breath.</p>

<p>"Shall it be among ourselves?" said one of them.</p>

<p>"No," replied the author of the proposition; "for then two of us
would have to fight, whereas it ought to be the thirteenth."</p>

<p>"Right," said all the young men.</p>

<p>"Then let it be with one of the officers of the garrison."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said Alfonse; "we will make a pool, as usual, at the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i>, all thirteen of us; and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The first out," said the student.</p>

<p>"No," interrupted Alfonse, "that would be a bad omen; it shall
be the winner."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" replied all, and they sate down to table with as much
gaiety and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insouciance</i> as if nothing had been said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger, just as the soup was being put on the table, got up,
and with a magisterial tone of voice addressed the assembly. "Gentlemen,"
said he, "I feel suddenly inspired with a sublime idea. We
are about to eat and drink in the ruins of Roman greatness (alluding
to the amphitheatre). Let us imitate that people in every thing that
is great. Nothing could be more splendid than the games of the
gladiators which were celebrated over the tombs of the mighty dead,&mdash;nothing
more sumptuous than the festivals held at their funerals.
This is probably also a funereal fête; with this difference, that it is
held before, and not after death. Let Poitiers therefore rival Rome
in her magnificence; let this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cena</i> be in honour of the mighty remains
over which we are sitting; let it be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">morituro</i>,&mdash;sacred to him
who is about to perish."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" exclaimed the guests one and all; "a splendid idea, by
Jove!&mdash;a splendid <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cena</i> be it!"</p>

<p>"Open the windows!" cried Alfonse. The windows were opened.
As soon as the soup was served, smash went all the plates into the
yard, and shivered against the pavement. So, during the rest of dinner,
every plate as fast as it was cleared, every bottle as soon as emptied,
followed their fellows. One might perceive, by the practised
dexterity of this feat, that it was not the first time they had played
the same game.</p>

<p>During the first course nothing particular occurred to disturb their
harmony; but it so happened that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôti</i>, which is, as you know,
in France always served last, was burnt. Then there arose a general
burst of indignation.</p>

<p>"Send the cook!" exclaimed they all to the waiters.</p>

<p>"Order up the cook! Here, cook! cook!" was the universal cry.</p>

<p>But the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</i> was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>Alfonse, the president, then said, "Must I go myself and fetch
him?"</p>

<p>This menace had its effect: the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pauvre chef</i>, pale as death, and all
cotton cap in hand, crawled into the room. He was greeted with
deafening shouts.</p>

<p>"Come here!" said Alfonse. "Do you take us for the officers?
What do you mean by serving us in this manner,&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>The man of the spit stammered out an apology. Alfonse looked
at him askance.</p>

<p>"If I served you right," said he, "I should make you eat this
detestable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôti</i> of yours; but, as it is the first time of happening,
my chastisement shall be a paternal one. Hold out your cotton
cap."</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</i> obeyed, and Alfonse turned out of a dish into it an enormous
clouted cream (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">omelet soufflé</i>), and said,</p>

<p>"Come, now, on with the cap, and see you don't first spill a drop."</p>

<p>He was forced to comply; and the unhappy Ude (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">udus</i>), his face
and white jacket streaming with the contents of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plat</i>, was followed
out of the room with hisses and bursts of laughter.</p>

<p>Thus went on the dinner, and with it a concert of broken plates,
dishes, glasses, and bottles, accompanied by noises of all sorts, which
rose to <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fortissimo</i> as the wine, of which they drank to excess, got
into their heads.</p>

<p>The dessert, which succeeded the second course, was ended by what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
they called a salad. This salad was thus mixed. They turned up
the four corners of the table-cloth, and rolled therein all the fragments
that were left. At this juncture the waiters disappeared,
conjecturing shrewdly that, if they stayed any longer, the feast might
be too grand for them. In short, when all that remained of the dessert
was bundled well up, the collegians got on the table, and, at
the risk of cutting their feet with the fragments of the crockery,
and the splinters of the glass, danced thereon, till everything was
pounded, smashed, and broken. Then the table-cloth, with all it
contained, (the salad,) was thrown out of the window; after it the
table, then the chairs, then the rest of the furniture, and, when
there was nothing more to destroy, the frenzied youths thought
they could do no better than throw themselves out; and all the thirteen
"followed the leader," Alfonse, and jumped from the first floor
into the court.</p>

<p>There is a saying, that over drunkards watches an especial Providence.
But there are, it seems, two; for the students, on this occasion,
found one of their own, which doubtless befriended them in this
mad leap. Certain it is that none of the party met with the slightest
accident, and, gloriously drunk, they rushed out into the street, after
the most remarkable orgie that had taken place for some time at
Poitiers.</p>

<p>They made a brilliant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i> into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i>,&mdash;a general place of rendezvous
for the students and officers when they were not at daggers
drawn.</p>

<p>Two of the latter were playing at billiards when they entered.
But Alfonse, without waiting till the game was ended, asked, or
rather demanded, in an authoritative tone, that the table should be
given up for a single pool to the thirteen.</p>

<p>Thinking that the object was, as usual, to decide who should pay
for the dinner, or the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-tasse et chasse</i>, the players did not seem inclined
to comply with this requisition; but when they learnt that a
more momentous affair, a duel, was on foot, they hastened to lay
down their cues. A duel! everything must yield to that!</p>

<p>There were but few military men present, for that very day there
was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i> at the general-commandant's of the garrison; and those
few consisted of veterans, who preferred passing the evening at the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i> to putting on silk-stockings and shoes, or of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chenapans</i>, who in
the regiment went by the name of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crans</i>, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourreaux des cranes</i>.
The old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grognards</i>, however, did not quit the room. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chenapans</i>
interchanged glances with each other; and one or two of the sub-lieutenants,
who had come to take their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-tasse</i> before they went to
the ball, also remained. They had all more or less formed a shrewd
guess of what was to happen; and, for the honour of the service,
waited for the quarrel to break out.</p>

<p>In our schools and garrisons at Paris we are totally unacquainted
with that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> which engages a whole regiment, and an entire
body of young men, in a duel, when two only are concerned; nor
can we form a notion how slight a thing a duel is considered, when it
is the custom to decide all questions sword in hand. Habit is all in
all; and people soon learn to think no more of fighting than going
to breakfast.</p>

<p>It becomes a general endemic; and a person who, lost in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
world of Paris, where he is unknown, might hesitate about demanding
satisfaction for an insult however gross, would, in that atmosphere, be
ready any day, or hour of the day, to call a man out for merely looking
at him.</p>

<p>The pool was begun. Never did a party, when a large sum of
money depended on the issue of the game, play with more care and
caution than those thirteen to decide which of them was to fight. By
degrees the players lost their three lives, and the number was at last
reduced to two; these two were the stranger guest and Alfonse.
The lookers-on watched anxiously every stroke. Those balls, that as
they rolled carried with them the fate of a man, were followed by
earnest looks. The officers came nearer and nearer, and ranged
themselves round the billiard. They were not a little interested to
know whether they, or rather one of them,&mdash;which they knew not,&mdash;was
to enter the lists with a freshman, no doubt unpractised in fencing,
or with the most adroit and terrible duellist of the university.</p>

<p>The chances were against them. The stranger lost.</p>

<p>A singular excitement was occasioned by the disappearance of the
last ball in the pocket. Some faces grew pale; but no one stirred
from the spot where he had been standing as a spectator. Alfonse
looked steadily round him, and made two or three times the circuit of
the room, as though he were in search, but in vain, of some one worth
quarrelling with. At last he perceived a sort of sub-lieutenant, originally
drum-major and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître-d'armes</i>, and who boasted of having
killed his thirty pequins, sitting quietly in a corner. Alfonse walked
straight up to him, and, saluting him with a politeness that electrified
the company, said, in his cool way,</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I am exceedingly distressed at the situation in which I
find myself placed; but my honour is concerned, and you will allow
me to engage yours."</p>

<p>Without further preliminaries, he gave him a severe hit in the face.</p>

<p>The officer, who little expected so abrupt and unanswerable a mode
of provocation, sprang like a madman from his chair; and had not Alfonse,
with the activity and nimbleness of a cat, leaped with one bound
on the table, the ex-drum-major would probably have strangled him
on the spot.</p>

<p>He was quickly at the aggressor's heels, when his own comrades
stopped him of their own accord, saying,</p>

<p>"Come, come! no child's play or boxing! the thing is too serious!
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est un combat à la mort!</i>"</p>

<p>"Where shall I find you to-morrow?" said one of the officers, addressing
Alfonse.</p>

<p>"Fix your ground," was the reply.</p>

<p>"No to-morrows!" said the officer who had received the blow;
"this instant!"</p>

<p>"This instant be it, if you please," replied Alfonso with the utmost
indifference.</p>

<p>"I shall not sleep to-night till that blow is avenged!" said the
other, foaming with rage.</p>

<p>"I, too, want to unnumb my hand. I have hurt my knuckles
against your cheek-bones," said Alfonse.</p>

<p>"Where would they fight at such a time of night as this?" observed
some of the officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the garden behind the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i>," cried the ancient <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d'armes</i>;
"a sword in one hand, and a billiard-lamp in the other."</p>

<p>"But," said Alfonse, "I am tired. I know your style of fighting
men, <em>Crane</em>; you want to make me break ground, and drive me step
by step round the garden. Don't think it, my lad. Besides, the
lamp may go out. But, if you have no objection, the billiard-table
will be a good arena. We shall be well lighted, and there will be no
means of drawing back a foot.</p>

<p>"Be it so," said the other.</p>

<p>The doors were closed, and they laid hands on the waiters and the
proprietor of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i>, who were going to the police. The swords
were then brought. The two adversaries cast lots for them, and then
pulled off their coats and waistcoats, and unbuttoned their shirts, to
show that they had nothing under.</p>

<p>Both then took their swords.</p>

<p>The officer wrapt round his hand a handkerchief, leaving both ends
dangling. Alfonse neglected this practice, the object of which was
to distract the attention of the adversary by the perpetual flutter of
their two white points, thus to turn away his attention from the
sword. But Alfonse had a manner of fighting of his own, and cared
little for these petty proceedings. He never looked at the steel; but,
fixing his eye on that of his antagonist, anticipated every motion that
he made.</p>

<p>The two wrestlers, or gladiators I might say, got on the table together,
and, according to the terms or conditions agreed on between
the students and the officers, rested their swords on the
toes of their boots. A traveller from a commercial house who happened
to be present, and could have no interest in the scene other
than what its novelty excited, was fixed on to clap his hands three
times, and at the third the swords were upraised in the air, and the
two combatants came to guard.</p>

<p>A terrible silence reigned through the room, and for some seconds
it was only broken by the clashing of the steel; for both parties, as
they skirmished, were well aware that a single <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</i> was death.
The slightest stepping back, shrinking of the body, or leaping on one
side, must inevitably prove fatal.</p>

<p>The officer was a head and shoulders taller than Alfonse, and
looked as though he could crush him; but he little heeded this advantage,
if advantage it was, for he by degrees lowered his body till
he was right under the sword of his foe, and almost bent himself
down upon the bed of the table. No other change in his attitude
then took place.</p>

<p>All at once the officer, taking this posture for the effect of fear,
made a furious lunge, which was parried with the greatest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</i>
and skill, and Alfonse allowed the officer to return to his ground
without attempting to return it. His adversary was deceived by this
sort of timid defence, and, become more adventurous, attacked him
again with increased fury,&mdash;so much so, that, thrown off his guard,
his left foot quitted the cushion of the table, against which it
had been fixed. Then it was that Alfonse made a rapid lunge at
the officer's face. He endeavoured to regain the ground he had lost,
to resume his position. The student would not give him time, and
charged with impetuosity his disconcerted enemy, who could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
avoid his thrusts by keeping his body bent backwards. Alfonse
forced him to the edge of the table, when his foot tripped, and at that
moment drove the sword up to the hilt in his heart.</p>

<p>The unhappy officer cried out "Hit! hit!" Then he raised himself
to his full height, and fell backwards from the top of the table to
the floor.</p>

<p>Awful was the sound that the weight of that body made upon the
boards of the room! There was mixed up with it a feeling&mdash;a dread
lest the dead man should hurt himself in falling. Never did I see,
for I was present, so dreadful a contest! Never did I experience
anything so frightful as the silence of those two men,&mdash;as the flashing
of their swords by the light of the lamps,&mdash;as the fall of the vanquished,
who, disappearing behind the table, seemed at once to have
been engulfed in a tomb that opened from behind to receive him!</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="A_MARINES_COURTSHIP" id="A_MARINES_COURTSHIP"></a>A MARINE'S COURTSHIP.</h2>

<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY MICHAEL BURKE HONAN.</p>

<p class="f75 center">WITH AN ILLUSTRATION BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.</p>


<p>I have the honour to be one of that class of amphibious animals
called in his Majesty's service <em>sea-soldiers</em>; that is to say, I have the
honour to hold a commission in the noble, ancient, and most jolly
body of the Royal Marines. I am by profession, therefore, as well as
by nature, a miscellaneous individual; and circumstances have more
than once thrown me into situations where the desire to support the
credit of the cloth, added to my own stock of cheerful impudence,
have carried me through, in spite of difficulties which would have
appalled another man. I had the misfortune to be employed on
board one of the ships of the inner squadron in the Douro during the
siege of Oporto. I do not say misfortune out of any disrespect to
the commodore, or to the captain under whose command I was immediately
placed, or to my brother officers, for a more generous, convivial
set of fellows could not be got together; but I speak of the
place, and of the people, and of the few opportunities which were
afforded me of showing off a handsome uniform, and, I must say, rather
a well-made person, which it inclosed. Besides, I was kept on hard duty;
and though there were some pretty women who appeared on Sunday
during the cessations of the usual shower of shells from the Miguelite
camp, yet there were so many competitors for their smiles, that I
really could not take the trouble of making myself as amiable as I
otherwise should, and, as I flatter myself, I could. Don Pedro the
emperor, who now sleeps with his fathers, and whose heart is deposited
in the cathedral of Oporto, was then without the society of his
imperial and beautiful wife; and, whether it was to set a good example
to his court, or to prevent his mind from dwelling on the absence
of his true love, he was one of the most active of my rivals, and
I protest there was not a pretty face in the whole town that he had
not the pleasure of paying his addresses to. The Marquis of Loule,
his brother-in-law, also separated from that most lovely and most generous
of Portuguese princesses who now sits nightly at Lisbon,
smiling on all the world from her box at the French theatre in the
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Rua dos Condes</i>, was regularly employed in the same operations; and
I never took a sly peep at a pair of dark and bewitching eyes that I did
not find the emperor or the marquis also reconnoitring. The marquis
is one of the handsomest men in Europe, but with the most vacant
expression possible. He wins every heart at first sight, but he loses
his conquests as fast as he makes them. Women may be caught by
glare; and a man of high rank, an Adonis in face and person, must
tell: but I'll be hanged if the dear creatures are such fools as we think
them; and the marquis's wife first, and every other flame of his after,
have dismissed him, on finding that his good looks and brains were
not measured by the same scale. Then there was the Count Villa
Flor, and several other martial grandees; not to speak of the generals
and colonels of regiments, and the well-built and well-whiskered officers
of the British and French Legion, and the captains and first lieutenants
of our squadron. I run over this list just to show what difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
I had to contend with; and that, if I did not turn the head of
the whole town, there was a numerous list of operative love-makers
who shared the market with me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 494px;">
<a id="MARINE"></a><img src="images/i093.jpg" width="494" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A Marine's Courtship</div>
</div>

<p>About this time the senior captain of the squadron determined to
establish a signal-station to communicate with the ships of his Britannic
Majesty outside the bar; and, no fitting place being found on the
Pedroite side of the river, an application was made to General San
Martha, who commanded for the Miguelites, for permission to erect
a post on the left bank, which permission was most liberally granted.
A party was instantly set to work, and in the course of a few days a
flag-staff was hoisted; and a large house and court-yard given for the
accommodation of the officer and men who were to work it. As luck
would have it, I was selected for this service, in company with a
wild lieutenant of the fleet, and we soon established ourselves in a
comfortable quarter, having the permission to rove about among the
Miguelite grounds where we pleased, and to cross as usual to Oporto,
when leave of absence was to be procured.</p>

<p>We had not been long established at this fort, when the batteries
which the Miguelites had established at the mouth of the river began
to do their work in good earnest, and so effectually to close the bar,
that not only was the usual supply of provisions cut off, but strong
fears were entertained that the city would be reduced by famine to
capitulate. There was an abundance of salt fish, or <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">bacalhao</i>, and a
superfluity of port wine; but even the best fare will tire on repetition,
and you may be assured that salt fish for breakfast, dinner, and
supper was not very acceptable to the officers or the men. Our commodore,
with the foresight that distinguishes a British officer, had
provided for the coming difficulty; and had arranged with the Miguelite
general for an abundant supply of fresh provisions, meat,
poultry, and vegetables, for all the ships' crews, on the distinct understanding
that no part of it was to be passed over to the besieged
city. The squadron therefore lived in abundance, while the garrison
was half starved; and as we passed through the streets with our
shining red faces and sleek sides, puffed out by the good cheer our
commodore had provided, we formed a strong contrast to the lean and
shrivelled soldiers of glory, who were starving in honour of the charter.
The private families of the town also began to suffer, and the beauty
of many of the most admired, sensibly to diminish; salt fish and port
wine did not in combination make a healthy chyle: and I could observe
that the Oporto ladies, more carefully than before, wrapped
their long dark cloaks about them, to hide the ravages which short
commons was making in the plumpness of their persons.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that I conceived and executed the bold plan
which forms the subject of this paper, and from which all learned
communities may be informed that, for originality of thought and
ability in the execution, no adventurer can compare to a British marine.</p>

<p>The most beautiful maiden at Oporto was a Spanish girl called
Carolina. She was the daughter of the alcade of Ponte Vedra in
Galicia, who had fled some time before, from the retributive justice of
the law, which he himself had so long administered; he had died
months before the present period, leaving Carolina exposed to all the
privations of a besieged town, and to the temptations of a profligate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and military court. I never saw a more lovely creature: her eyes
were as dark as night, and her cheeks glowed with a warmth unknown
in the cold complexions of the north. Her person was
faultless; her feet and her hands were small: one could span her
waist; and she walked with that combination of majesty and grace
which a Spanish woman can alone assume. Poor Carolina was as
good as she was beautiful; and though the emperor, and his hopeful brother-in-law,
and all the gay cavaliers of the camp, were ready to throw
themselves at her feet, she behaved with a discretion which won her
the good opinion of the whole army, not to speak of the fleet, where
such remarkable virtue could be fully estimated. I among the rest
of the inflammable multitude had been struck with the magic charms
of the angelic Carolina, and devoted every moment of the occasional
leave of absence which I procured, to promenading up and down before
her window, in the hope of catching a glance of her beautiful
eyes, and of attracting her regard to my own beloved person. I was
as much in love with her as a marine could be, and my hopeless passion
became so well known that it was a standing joke at the mess-table,
and our wicked wag of a commodore, who I fancied was a little
caught himself, never failed to inquire if I had taken my usual walk,
and met with the same good fortune.</p>

<p>You can easily imagine my delight when I heard that a scarcity
was making such rapid progress in the city, and when I found that
even the emperor's table was limited to the ordinary rations of <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">bacalhao</i>,
black bread, and port wine. I will own that my heart
leaped for joy when I ascertained from an emissary employed to
watch the house of Carolina that she too was experiencing the pangs
of want, and that with her scanty means she was unable to procure
the common necessaries for her sustenance. Our ships were abundantly
supplied, as I have before informed you; and the little signal-station
which I occupied was the abode of plenty. The Miguelites
faithfully performed their engagement; and day after day the regular
supplies of beef, poultry, vegetables, and fruit came in. The commodore
of course respected the contract that he had entered into; and
though the emperor made several advances to his favour, and though
he was openly solicited on his behalf by various officers of the staff,
he refused to allow a pound of meat to be passed into the city. Several
of the British residents represented their claims in a formal
manner for his protection; but he did his duty like a man, and he
resolutely determined not to break the engagement he had entered
into with the general of Don Miguel, or compromise the safety of his
own crews by giving way to his good-nature. The value of a leg of
fowl may therefore be estimated; and it immediately occurred to me
that I could soften the obdurate heart of the beautiful Spaniard by
secretly conveying to her some portion of the stock which was appropriated
to our own table.</p>

<p>I therefore set about purloining a capital <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">gallina</i>; and when I had
secured it, in defiance of the jealous watch of the steward, I crammed
it into my pocket, and, asking leave to go on shore, started
about the close of day to try whether hunger, which breaks through
stone walls, would open the oak door of the charming Carolina. I
soon found myself in the well-known quarter, and before the house
that contained my love; and, after reconnoitring for an instant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
see that the emperor or his staff were not in the way, ran up to the
first landing, where she lived, and pulled the little bell-string which
hung at the door. In an instant I heard the pretty feet tapping along
the passage, and the soft voice of Carolina herself exclaiming "<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Quien
es?</i>" Who is there? "It is I, a British officer, and a friend of yours,"
I replied; "I want particularly to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Carolina, "I have not the honour of your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"It is true, señorita; but I come to serve you, and my good intentions
will excuse the absence of ceremony."</p>

<p>"Sir, I must wish you a good day: I cannot accept a service from
strangers; I have not asked you for any."</p>

<p>"Stay, beautiful Carolina," I exclaimed; "I adore you."</p>

<p>"Sir, I have the honour to wish you good evening."</p>

<p>"Stay, angelic vision: I am an officer of Marines."</p>

<p>"What have I to do with the Marines?"</p>

<p>"I come to devote myself to you."</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;really sir, you carry the joke too far; I must dispense with
your unseasonable visit. I have again the honour to wish you good
evening."</p>

<p>Carolina was about to close the little slide of the door through
which this brief conversation had been carried on, when, growing
desperate with vexation, I held the slide open with one hand, while
with the other I pulled the fowl from my pocket, and held it dangling
before her face. Oh! if you had seen her look!&mdash;her eyes were
fixed as Hamlet's when he sees his father's ghost, her mouth opened,
and two little rivulets of water ran down at each side as when an
alderman gets the first odour of a well-kept haunch.</p>

<p>"Señorita," said I, eager to take advantage of the favourable impression
the vision of the fowl had made on my beloved; "this bird
is a proof of the warm interest which I take in your welfare. I have
heard that you were suffering from the severe affliction that has
fallen on this city; and, though I risk my character and the safety of
his Britannic Majesty's fleet by bringing into Oporto any part of the
provision allotted for the crews, I could not resist the impulse of
stealing this bird, which I now have the honour to lay at your feet."</p>

<p>The señorita answered not: pride on the one hand, and hunger
on the other, were struggling. The physical want prevailed over
the moral feeling. "Señor," said she, "I will accept the fowl, and
cannot but feel obliged by the interest you have taken in my welfare.
Good night, señor; it is getting late: I am certain you are anxious
to return to your ship." With these words she shut the little slide
of the door, and I remained in the passage, gaping with astonishment,
confounded with delight, and wondering at the new recipe I
had invented for making love. I waited for some time, hoping that
the little wicket would be again opened; but Carolina, I presume,
was too much occupied with the present I had made her to think
of returning to bid me a second farewell; and I descended the staircase,
charmed beyond expression with the result of my stratagem.</p>

<p>I kept, of course, my recipe for making love a profound secret;
but I did not venture to put it again into operation for two or three
days. I made, however, the accustomed regular survey of the street
in which Carolina resided, and watched with much interest for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
reception given to my rivals. I cannot express the delight with
which I witnessed them all, one after the other, refused admittance
to her house. "She is picking the bones of the fowl," thought I;
"that is a much better employment than listening to their stupid declarations.
I must take care to keep my mistress in good humour,
and to improve the favourable opinion she has already formed of
me." I therefore watched my opportunity; secured a duck out of the
next basket of poultry, and hastened on the wings of love to lay my
treasure at her feet. No sooner did my trembling hand pull the bell-cord,
and my eager voice announce my name, than I heard her gentle
step in the passage, and soon the little slide of the door was opened,
and I felt my heart leap to my mouth as I beheld her beautiful eye
beaming on me with undisguised satisfaction. To ensure my welcome,
and to save the dear creature from the pangs of expectation,
I produced the duck, swinging it to and fro before the wicket, as a
nurse does a pretty toy that she offers to the longing wishes of the
child. Carolina smiled her sweetest smile; and, when I pushed in the
prize, she returned me thanks in so endearing a manner that I lost
all command of my reason, and poured out upon the staircase a volume
of protestations of eternal love which might have served for the
whole ship's company. From that hour my affair was done. Carolina
could not resist the voice of truth, and the tender proofs of esteem
which I alone had the power to offer. She refused to admit me
then, but promised to consult her aunt on the propriety of receiving
my visits; and that, if the discreet matron permitted it, she would be
too happy in my acquaintance. I entreated the dear girl not to delay
my happiness, and I fixed the following Thursday for the formidable
interview with the aunt.</p>

<p>I lay the whole of the next night awake, thinking over the present
which would be most acceptable to the old lady. I finally resolved
to purloin a small leg of lamb, which I observed hung up in the steward's
pantry; and, in order to make room for it in my pocket, I cut a
great hole in the bottom, so that the handle of the leg would hang
down, while the thicker part prevented it from slipping through.
<em>Armed</em> with my leg, I asked leave to go to Oporto, and received with
joy the accustomed friendly nod. I soon landed at the arsenal, and
mounted the long hill which led into the town, holding myself as
straight as possible, so that the exuberance of my pocket should not be
perceived. Unfortunately for me, a score of hungry dogs, which infest
all Portuguese towns, were holding a council of war at the quay
when I stept on shore; and one of them, getting scent of the end of
the leg of mutton which hung through the hole in my pocket, gave a
hint to the rest of the contraband which was going on, and I soon had
the whole train after me, sniffing at my tail, and making snaps at the
tempting morsel. I would have stooped to pick up a stone, which is
the only way of frightening a Portuguese street dog; but I was afraid
to disarrange the perpendicular, recollecting that, as I bent down, the
end of the leg of lamb would be visible. I therefore bore the annoyance
as well as I could, kicking out behind from time to time when
my friends were most troublesome.</p>

<p>Carolina and her aunt were at the window, probably expecting my
arrival, and enduring the grumbling recollections of an ill-digested
dinner of <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">bacalhao</i>, in the hope of a more wholesome supper being provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
for them through my care; but when they saw me turn the
corner of the street, and at least two dozen dogs smelling and sniffing
at my skirts, they both burst out into an uncontrollable fit of laughter,
and roared and roared again in a paroxysm of mirth. A crowd
of dandies were passing at the moment, watching the window
of Carolina, each hoping to be the favoured man; but when they
heard the sudden burst of merriment which proceeded from her window,
they looked round naturally for the cause, and they soon joined
in the same chorus at my expense, on seeing me parade, with all the
gravity of a drum-major, at the head of a legion of filthy curs.</p>

<p>To make my situation worse, I dared not enter the house of Carolina;
her character would be compromised by a visit in presence of
so many admirers: and I had the additional mortification of being
obliged to pass her door, and to walk a considerable distance until I
escaped the impertinence of the sneering puppies, though I could
not shake off the annoyance of those that followed at my heels. How
gladly would I have drawn my sword, and challenged the whole party!
how cheerfully would I have drawn the leg of lamb from my
pocket, and stuffed it in the mouth of each impertinent dandy! but not
only was my own honour at stake, but that of the British fleet, and I
bore all in the king's name, and for the credit of the service. I have
been in many a hot engagement, but I never suffered more than I
did that day. At length, after doubling through two or three by-streets,
I got rid of my impudent macaroni, and traced my way back
again to the house of my beloved. She, with the old lady, were
watching me from the window; but, grown wiser by experience, and
probably afraid of losing a good supper, they did not laugh again with
the same violence. I observed, however, the wicked smile with which
my fair one retired to receive me at the door, and the suppressed
titter with which the maiden aunt pulled her head from the window.</p>

<p>The cursed dogs followed me up stairs, and it was with considerable
difficulty I could prevent the most insolent from forcing their way
with me into the presence of my mistress; but, after I got in, I heard
them growling and barking on the stairs. The neighbours wondered
what the deuce was the matter with the curs, or why they had
come from their usual haunts to that unfrequented quarter.</p>

<p>The señorita presented me in due form to her aunt.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said she, "to introduce to you, dear aunt, this gallant
English cavalier, Señor <em>Gallina</em>,&mdash;I beg pardon, Señor Marinero,&mdash;and
permit me to present to you, señor, my respected aunt, Donna
Francisca Azanares."</p>

<p>I made a low bow, but said nothing, seeing that my mistress
thought more of the fowl than of me; such is the way of the world,
and those who will win women must endure to have their pride occasionally
mortified. The old lady, however, covered me with compliments;
she was delighted to make my acquaintance; her niece
had told her what an amiable and gentlemanlike young man I was.
I could observe, while the aunt was hard at work overloading me
with compliments, that Carolina was taking a sly peep at the bulk of
my pockets, and wondering what kind of commodity it was that produced
so misplaced a swelling on so well-formed a young man as I
flatter myself no one can deny I am; but, just at this moment,
the bevy of hungry curs at the door set up such a howl in concert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
that my angel was fain to cram her handkerchief into her mouth
to conceal her laughing, and I thought the old dame would go into a
fit, so violent was her merriment. Finding the case going thus hard
against me, I determined to strike a bold stroke for conquest; so,
slipping out my penknife, I slit up the pocket where the treasure lay,
and down fell the leg of lamb in all its natural beauty on the floor.
I thought the aunt would have fainted with delight, such an unexpected
vision of glory dazzled her understanding and her sight. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouquet</i> of the meat was, I suppose, conveyed through the keyhole
to the canine multitude that still lined the stairs, and another universal
howl proclaimed their despair that it was beyond their reach.</p>

<p>I soon took my leave, to the delight of Carolina and her aunt.
I think I showed considerable tact in so doing; well knowing that a
slice off the leg of lamb would be more acceptable to both than all the
professions of admiration which I was prepared to make. I ventured
on two or three civil things, but I could see my beloved's eyes fixed
upon the handle of the leg; and it was evident the aunt was carrying
on an internal debate whether it should be boiled, broiled, roasted,
or stewed, or served up, according to the fashion of the province,
with a mass of garlic. The dogs were waiting for me in the passage,
and they eagerly followed me as I went down stairs; even the
smell of my pocket had its attraction for them, but they dropped off
one by one when they found the reality was gone. One old savoury
rogue alone persecuted me to the river side; and though I pelted
him with stones, and kicked him when I could, he still hung on my
rear with his tongue out, licking the shreds which dangled from my
torn pocket.</p>

<p>The next day, when I went on board ship to make the usual report
to the captain, I found that a court of inquiry was going on into
the disappearance of the very leg of lamb which I had feloniously
purloined. The steward had reported the accident to the purveyor
of the mess, and he had called a council of war, who thought fit to
make an official report to the skipper; so that the readers will readily
imagine the agony of my feelings when I was asked to join the board,
and to assist in the investigation. Fortunately for me, one of the
aides-de-camp of the emperor had that morning come on board to
request of the captain some provision for the imperial table, protesting
that Don Pedro and his staff had nothing better than salt fish for
rations; which request the captain was compelled, by a strict sense
of duty, to refuse; and everybody set it down as certain, the instant
the circumstance was brought to mind, that it was the aide-de-camp
who stole the lamb. He had come wrapped up in his cloak, which
was a circumstance fatal to his character; and it was agreed by the
whole conclave that the gentleman with the gold-laced hat and large
cloak had been the thief. I blushed up to the eyes at the consciousness
of my guilt, and the dishonourable part I was playing in allowing
an innocent person to be wronged for my misdeed; but I recollected
that the young man was one of the party who ridiculed me the
day before in the presence of Carolina, and wounded vanity made me
disregard the twitchings of conscience.</p>

<p>In order to avoid suspicion, I lay quiet for a day or two, and allowed
Carolina and her aunt to feel the value of such an acquaintance
as I was, under existing circumstances. While engaged with the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
on some official duty, the following morning, in his cabin, a young
officer was introduced who solicited an immediate audience. The
young man appeared buried in grief, and every now and then applied
a handkerchief to his eyes, to wipe off the unbidden tears which
mocked the sword which hung at his side. His profound sorrow and
gentlemanlike appearance interested the good heart of our excellent
captain; he begged him to be seated, and wished to know what
service he could render him. The young man could with difficulty
master his emotion, and the only words that were heard from him
were, "My aunt!&mdash;my aunt!"</p>

<p>"Pray, sir, be composed;" said the captain, a little tired of the
display.</p>

<p>"I will, sir," replied the young man, giving a great gulp, as if to
swallow his misery, and applying his handkerchief to wipe off the
tears from both his swimming eyes. "Oh! sir," he continued, "my
poor aunt, she who reared me from a child, when I was left an
unprotected orphan, and has placed me in the station which I now
hold, is at the point of death, and the doctors all agree that nothing
but <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caldo di gallina</i> (fowl broth) can save her life. You know the
state which we are in at Oporto, and that not a fowl is to be had if
one offered a thousand milreas for it; I come to you, as a man and
a Christian, to beg you will give me one single chicken from your
larder."</p>

<p>"It is impossible," said the captain; "you know the convention
we have made with Santa Martha."</p>

<p>"I know all that," resumed the young man; "but you must admit,
my dear captain, that the convention is directed against the troops
of Don Pedro, and the inhabitants at large who support him; but
surely an old woman at the point of death was not contemplated by
the treaty, and I entreat you to save the life of this most deserving
and venerable of aunts." With these words the young officer again
took out his handkerchief, and gave way to a flood of tears that
would have moved the strictest disciplinarian that ever commanded a
ship.</p>

<p>It was not to be wondered at that the soft heart of our benevolent
skipper was affected. He took the young man by the hand, and
said, "My dear fellow, I can do nothing for you; I have signed a
convention, and I cannot break it, were it to save the emperor's life:
but go you to my steward, and if you can manage to extract a fowl
from what he has prepared for my table, you may do so; but take
care, I am not to know anything about it."</p>

<p>I fancied the young fellow smiled in the midst of his grief at the
mention of the emperor; but he dried up his tears in double quick
time, and soon made his way to the steward's room, where I suppose
he contrived to settle his affair to his satisfaction. He called on the
following day to return his grateful thanks; but the captain would
not hear a word. I observed, however, that he went down to the
steward's cabin, and took a hasty leave as he went over the ship's
side on his return. He scarcely failed to pay us a daily visit, and
made us all take a strong interest in him and the recovery of this
favourite aunt to whom he was so devotedly attached.</p>

<p>This aunt, we found out afterwards, was the emperor; and so reduced
was the imperial table for a short time, that Don Pedro must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
have starved, or lived on <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bacalhao</i>, if this stratagem had not been
adopted. The young fellow acted his part in a consummate manner,
and I am told he boasts to this day of the trick he played the British
squadron in the Douro. The captain, I am also told, gave him a little
of his mind, having met him last year near the Admiralty, dressed out
in fine feathers, and swelling with the importance of new-born greatness.
"How is your aunt, you d&mdash;&mdash; lying Portuguese?" said the
skipper. "If I ever catch you on board my ship, I'll give you a
rope's end, you dog!"</p>

<p>The more you beat one of the class of which this hero was a specimen,
the more he likes it. So our Pedroite friend shrugged up his
shoulders, and vanished in double quick time, the captain vociferating
after him, "How is your aunt, you lubber?"</p>

<p>Afraid of the consequences in case a discovery should take place,
I kept quiet for nearly a week together, until a little note, written in
a cramped hand, was brought for me to the signal-station, from which
I found by the confession of the aunt that Carolina was in despair at
not seeing me again, and that she was very ill from a salt-fish diet. I
was conscience-stricken at the consequences of my neglect, and determined
not to lose a moment in carrying provisions to my starving
beauty; so, running to a basket that had just been brought in from
the Miguelite market to be passed on board the commodore, I seized
a turkey-poult, feathers and all, and thrust it into the same coat-pocket
which had been enlarged to hold the leg of lamb. I asked and
received leave to go on shore, and pushed as fast as four oars could
impel me to the usual landing-place near the old nunnery. I saw
some of the idle dogs basking in the sun, but did not heed their presence,
so filled was I with the idea of my Carolina; and, jumping out
of the boat, I ran along the quay, totally unconscious of the sneers
that my presence excited. At last, when I got to the open rope-walk
where the market is usually held, the number of my canine assailants
became increased; and one of them, bolder than the rest, making a
sudden snap at the head of the young turkey, which hung down
through the fatal hole in my pocket, dragged its long neck to view,
and exposed my shame to the assembled multitude. A crowd immediately
gathered round me, and a score of other dogs began to contest
the prize with him that held the head of the turkey in his mouth. I
was in despair, and drew my sword to rid me of the cursed assailants;
when, on the instant, as if to overwhelm me with disgrace, the captain
of the ship to which I belonged forced his way through the crowd,
and, laying his hand on my arm, told me to consider myself under
arrest.</p>

<p>The turkey-poult had by this time been torn from my pocket by
the perseverance of my tormentors. It was pulled from one to the
other on the ground; while the hungry citizens endeavoured to save
its mangled remains, and a running fight was kept up between them
and the dogs, which under other circumstances would have been
highly amusing. My heart was heavy, and I was incapable of enjoying
the most palpable joke. I walked slowly to the quay side, threw
myself into the first boat that offered, went on board my ship, gave up
my sword to the senior officer; was placed under a formal arrest,
and told to prepare myself for a court of inquiry. I must say that I
felt more for poor Carolina than I did for myself; and I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
help expressing my anxiety on her account to one of the brother
officers who came to condole with me on my situation. The false
friend, I was told afterwards, profited by the hint; and, instead of committing
himself as I did, he hired a little cottage at the Miguelite
side of the river, under cover of the guns of the fleet, where he placed
Carolina and her aunt, and soon taught them to forget me. The
worst of the affair was, that General Santa Martha sent in a formal
complaint to the consul and the commodore of the squadron, and
threatened to stop the usual supply of provisions for the ships' use.
A long correspondence took place on the subject, which may be found
now in the records of the Foreign Office. I am glad to say, for the
credit of the service, that the affair was hushed up in the end, and
the Miguelites consented to give the required number of rations. I
was made the victim of that arrangement, and was glad to retire from
the service on half-pay, to escape being ignominiously dismissed by a
court-martial. I now live a miserable example of the doctrine of
expediency. I entertain a horror of young turkeys and of dogs, and
would be gladly informed of some land where neither of those odious
creatures are to be met with.</p>

<h3>THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.</h3>


<p>Reader, were you ever bewitched? I do not mean by a "white
wench's black eye," or by love-potions imbibed from a ruby lip; but,
were you ever really and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonâ fide</i> bewitched, in the true Matthew
Hopkins sense of the word? Did you ever, for instance, find yourself
from head to heel one vast complication of cramps? or burst out into
sudorific exudation like a cold thaw, with the thermometer at zero?
Were your eyes ever turned upside down, exhibiting nothing but
their whites? Did you ever vomit a paper of crooked pins? or expectorate
Whitechapel needles? These are genuine and undoubted
marks of possession; and if you never experienced any of them,&mdash;why,
"happy man be his dole!"</p>

<p>Yet such things have been; yea, we are assured, on no mean
authority, still are.</p>

<p>The world, according to the best geographers, is divided into Europe,
Asia, Africa, America, and Romney Marsh. In this last-named
and fifth quarter of the globe, a witch may still be occasionally
discovered in favourable, <em>i. e.</em> stormy, seasons, weathering Dungeness
Point in an egg-shell, or careering on her broomstick over
Dymchurch wall. A cow may yet be sometimes seen galloping like
mad, with tail erect, and an old pair of breeches on her horns, an unerring
guide to the door of the crone whose magic arts have drained
her udder. I do not, however, remember to have heard that any
conjuror has, of late, been detected in the district.</p>

<p>Not many miles removed from the verge of this recondite region,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
stands a collection of houses, which its maligners call a fishing-town,
and its well-wishers a Watering-place. A limb of one of the Cinque
Ports, it has (or lately had) a corporation of its own, and has been
thought considerable enough to give a second title to a noble family.
Rome stood on seven hills; Folkestone seems to have been built upon
seventy. Its streets, lanes, and alleys,&mdash;fanciful distinctions without
much real difference&mdash;are agreeable enough to persons who do not
mind running up and down stairs; and the only inconvenience at all
felt by such of its inhabitants as are not asthmatic, is when some
heedless urchin tumbles down a chimney, or an impertinent passenger
peeps into a garret window. At the eastern extremity of the town,
on the sea-beach, and scarcely above high-water mark, stood, in the
good old times, a row of houses then denominated "Frog-hole;" modern
refinement subsequently euphonized the name into "East-street:"
but what's in a name? the encroachments of Ocean have
long since levelled all in one common ruin. Here, in the early part
of the seventeenth century, flourished, in somewhat doubtful reputation,
but comparative opulence, a compounder of medicines, one Master
Erasmus Buckthorne; the effluvia of whose drugs from within,
mingling agreeably with the "ancient and fish-like smells" from
without, wafted a delicious perfume throughout the neighbourhood.
At seven of the clock in the morning when Mrs. Botherby's narrative
commences, a stout Suffolk punch, about thirteen hands and a
half in height, was slowly led up and down before the door of the
pharmacopolist by a lean and withered lad, whose appearance warranted
an opinion, pretty generally expressed, that his master found
him as useful in experimentalizing as in household drudgery, and
that, for every pound avoirdupoise of solid meat, he swallowed at the
least two pounds troy-weight of chemicals and galenicals. As the
town clock struck the quarter, Master Buckthorne emerged from
his laboratory, and, putting the key carefully into his pocket, mounted
the sure-footed cob aforesaid, and proceeded up and down the acclivities
and declivities of the town with the gravity due to his station
and profession. When he reached the open country, his pace
was increased to a sedate canter, which, in somewhat more than
half an hour, brought "the horse and his rider" in front of a handsome
and substantial mansion, the numerous gable-ends and bayed windows
of which bespoke the owner a man of worship, and one well to do in
the world.</p>

<p>"How now, Hodge Gardener?" quoth the leech, scarcely drawing
bit; for Punch seemed to be aware that he had reached his destination,
and paused of his own accord; "how now, man? How fares
thine employer, worthy Master Marsh? How hath he done? How
hath he slept? My potion hath done its office? Ha!"</p>

<p>"Alack! ill at ease, worthy sir,&mdash;ill at ease," returned the hind;
"his honour is up and stirring; but he hath rested none, and complaineth
that the same gnawing pain devoureth, as it were, his very
vitals: in sooth he is ill at ease."</p>

<p>"Morrow, doctor!" interrupted a voice from a casement opening
on the lawn. "Good morrow! I have looked for, longed for, thy coming

the leech <em>sotto voce</em>, as, abandoning the bridle to honest Hodge, he
dismounted, and followed a buxom-looking handmaiden into the
breakfast parlour.</p>

<p>There, at the head of his well-furnished board, sat Master Thomas
Marsh, of Marshton-Hall, a Yeoman well respected in his degree; one
of that sturdy and sterling class which, taking rank immediately below
the Esquire, (a title in its origin purely military,) occupied, in the
wealthier counties, the position in society now filled by the Country
Gentleman. He was one of those of whom the proverb ran:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"A Knight of Cales,</div>
<div class="verse">A Gentleman of Wales,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">And a Laird of the North Countree;</div>
<div class="verse">A Yeoman of Kent,</div>
<div class="verse">With his yearly rent,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Will buy them out all three!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A cold sirloin, big enough to frighten a Frenchman, filled the place
of honour, counter-checked by a game-pie of no stinted dimensions;
while a silver flagon o£ "humming-bub," <em>viz.</em> ale strong enough to
blow a man's beaver off, smiled opposite in treacherous amenity. The
sideboard groaned beneath sundry massive cups and waiters of the
purest silver; while the huge skull of a fallow-deer, with its branching
horns, frowned majestically above. All spoke of affluence, of
comfort,&mdash;all save the master, whose restless eye and feverish look
hinted but too plainly the severest mental or bodily disorder. By the
side of the proprietor of the mansion sat his consort, a lady now past
the bloom of youth, yet still retaining many of its charms. The clear
olive of her complexion, and "the darkness of her Andalusian eye," at
once betrayed her foreign origin; in fact, her "lord and master," as
husbands were even then, by a legal fiction, denominated, had taken
her to his bosom in a foreign country. The cadet of his family, Master
Thomas Marsh, had early in life been engaged in commerce. In
the pursuit of his vocation he had visited Antwerp, Hamburg, and
most of the Hanse Towns; and had already formed a tender connexion
with the orphan offspring of one of old Alva's officers, when the unexpected
deaths of one immediate and two presumptive heirs placed
him next in succession to the family acres. He married, and brought
home his bride; who, by the decease of the venerable possessor,
heart-broken at the loss of his elder children, became eventually
lady of Marshton-Hall. It has been said that she was beautiful, yet
was her beauty of a character that operates on the fancy more than
the affections; she was one to be admired rather than loved. The
proud curl of her lip, the firmness of her tread, her arched brow, and
stately carriage, showed the decision, not to say haughtiness of her
soul; while her glances, whether lightening with anger, or melting
in extreme softness, betrayed the existence of passions as intense in
kind as opposite in quality. She rose as Erasmus entered the parlour,
and, bestowing on him a look fraught with meaning, quitted the
room, leaving him in unconstrained communication with his patient.</p>

<p>"'Fore George, Master Buckthorne!" exclaimed the latter, as the
leech drew near, "I will no more of your pharmacy;&mdash;burn, burn&mdash;gnaw,
gnaw,&mdash;I had as lief the foul fiend were in my gizzard as one
of your drugs. Tell me, in the devil's name, what is the matter with
me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus conjured, the practitioner paused, and even turned somewhat
pale. There was a perceptible faltering in his voice as, evading the
question, he asked, "What say your other physicians?"</p>

<p>"Doctor Phiz says it is wind,&mdash;Doctor Fuz says it is water,&mdash;and
Doctor Buz says it is something between wind and water."</p>

<p>"They are all of them wrong," said Erasmus Buckthorne.</p>

<p>"Truly, I think so," returned the patient. "They are manifest
asses; but you, good leech, you are a horse of another colour. The
world talks loudly of your learning, your skill, and cunning in arts
the most abstruse; nay, sooth to say, some look coldly on you therefore,
and stickle not to aver that you are cater-cousin with Beelzebub
himself."</p>

<p>"It is ever the fate of science," murmured the professor, "to be
maligned by the ignorant and superstitious. But a truce with such
folly; let me examine your palate."</p>

<p>Master Marsh thrust out a tongue long, clear, and red as beet-root.
"There is nothing wrong there," said the leech. "Your wrist:&mdash;no;
the pulse is firm and regular, the skin cool and temperate. Sir, there
is nothing the matter with you!"</p>

<p>"Nothing the matter with me, Sir Potecary?" But I tell you
there is the matter with me,&mdash;much the matter with me. Why is it
that something seems ever gnawing at my heart-strings? Whence
this pain in the region of the liver? Why is it that I sleep not o'
nights, rest not o' days? Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are fidgety, Master Marsh," said the doctor.</p>

<p>Master Marsh's brow grew dark; he half rose from his seat, supported
himself by both hands on the arms of his elbow-chair, and in
accents of mingled anger and astonishment repeated the word
"Fidgety!"</p>

<p>"Ay, fidgety," returned the doctor calmly. "Tut, man, there is
nought ails thee save thine own overweening fancies. Take less of
food, more air, put aside thy flagon, call for thy horse; be boot and
saddle the word! Why,&mdash;hast thou not youth?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have," said the patient.</p>

<p>"Wealth, and a fair domain?"</p>

<p>"Granted," quoth Marsh cheerily.</p>

<p>"And a fair wife?"</p>

<p>"Yea," was the response, but in a tone something less satisfied.</p>

<p>"Then arouse thee, man, shake off this fantasy, betake thyself to
thy lawful occasions, use thy good hap, follow thy pleasures, and
think no more of these fancied ailments."</p>

<p>"But I tell you, master mine, these ailments are not fancied. I
lose my rest, I loathe my food, my doublet sits loosely on me,&mdash;these
racking pains. My wife, too,&mdash;when I meet her gaze, the cold sweat
stands on my forehead, and I could almost think&mdash;&mdash;" Marsh paused
abruptly, mused a while, then added, looking steadily at his visitor,
"These things are not right; they pass the common, Master Erasmus
Buckthorne."</p>

<p>A slight shade crossed the brow of the leech, but its passage was
momentary; his features softened to a smile, in which pity seemed
slightly blended with contempt. "Have done with such follies, Master
Marsh. You are well, an you would but think so. Ride, I say,
hunt, shoot, do anything,&mdash;disperse these melancholic humours, and
become yourself again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I will do your bidding," said Marsh thoughtfully. "It may
be so; and yet,&mdash;but I will do your bidding. Master Cobbe of
Brenzet writes me that he hath a score or two of fat ewes to be sold
a pennyworth; I had thought to have sent Ralph Looker, but I will
essay to go myself. Ho, there!&mdash;saddle me the brown mare, and bid
Ralph be ready to attend me on the gelding."</p>

<p>An expression of pain contracted the features of Master Marsh as
he rose and slowly quitted the apartment to prepare for his journey;
while the leech, having bidden him farewell, vanished through an opposite
door, and betook himself to the private boudoir of the fair mistress
of Marshton, muttering as he went a quotation from a then
newly-published play,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"Not poppy, nor mandragora,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,</div>

<div class="verse">Which thou own'st yesterday."</div>
</div></div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of what passed at this interview between the Folkestone doctor
and the fair Spaniard, Mrs. Botherby declares she could never obtain
any satisfactory elucidation. Not that tradition is silent on the subject,&mdash;quite
the contrary; it is the abundance, not paucity, of the
materials she supplies, and the consequent embarrassment of selection,
that make the difficulty. Some have averred that the leech,
whose character, as has been before hinted, was more than thread-bare,
employed his time in teaching her the mode of administering
certain noxious compounds, the unconscious partaker whereof would
pine and die so slowly and gradually as to defy suspicion. Others
there were who affirmed that Lucifer himself was then and there
raised <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propriâ personâ</i>, with all his terrible attributes of horn and
hoof. In support of this assertion, they adduce the testimony of the
aforesaid buxom housemaid, who protested that the Hall smelt that
evening like a manufactory of matches. All, however, seem to agree
that the confabulation, whether human or infernal, was conducted
with profound secrecy, and protracted to a considerable length; that
its object, as far as could be divined, meant anything but good to the
head of the family; that the lady, moreover, was heartily tired of her
husband; and that, in the event of his removal by disease or casualty,
Master Erasmus Buckthorne, albeit a great philosophist,
would have had no violent objection to throw physic to the dogs, and
exchange his laboratory for the estate of Marshton, its live stock included.
Some, too, have inferred that to him did Madam Isabel
seriously incline; while others have thought, induced perhaps by
subsequent events, that she was merely using him for her purposes;
that one José, a tall, bright-eyed, hook-nosed stripling from her native
land, was a personage not unlikely to put a spoke in the doctor's
wheel; and that, should such a chance arise, the Sage, wise as he
was, would, after all, run no slight risk of being "bamboozled."</p>

<p>Master José was a youth well-favoured and comely to look upon.
His office was that of page to the dame; an office which, after long
remaining in abeyance, has been of late years revived, as may well be
seen in the persons of sundry smart hobbledehoys, now constantly to
be met with on staircases and in boudoirs, clad, for the most part, in
garments fitted tightly to the shape, the lower moiety adorned with a
broad strip of crimson or silver lace, and the upper with what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
first Wit of our times describes as "a favourable eruption of buttons."
The precise duties of this employment have never, as far as we have
heard, been accurately defined. The perfuming a handkerchief, the
combing a lap-dog, and the occasional presentation of a sippet-shaped
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billet doux</i>, are, and always have been, among them; but these a young
gentleman standing five foot ten, and aged nineteen "last grass,"
might well be supposed to have outgrown. José, however, kept his
place, perhaps because he was not fit for any other. To the conference
between his mistress and the physician he had not been admitted;
his post was to keep watch and ward in the ante-room; and,
when the interview was concluded, he attended the lady and her
visitor as far as the court-yard, where he held, with all due respect, the
stirrup for the latter, as he once more resumed his position on the
back of Punch.</p>

<p>Who is it that says "little pitchers have large ears?" Some deep
metaphysician of the potteries, who might have added that they have
also quick eyes, and sometimes silent tongues. There was a little
metaphorical piece of crockery of this class, who, screened by a huge
elbow-chair, had sat a quiet and unobserved spectator of the whole
proceedings between her mamma and Master Erasmus Buckthorne.
This was Miss Marian Marsh, a rosy-cheeked, laughter-loving imp of
some six years old; but one who could be mute as a mouse when the
fit was on her. A handsome and highly-polished cabinet of the darkest
ebony occupied a recess at one end of the apartment; this had long
been a great subject of speculation to little Miss. Her curiosity,
however, had always been repelled; nor had all her coaxing ever won
her an inspection of the thousand and one pretty things which its
recesses no doubt contained. On this occasion it was unlocked, and
Marian was about to rush forward in eager anticipation of a peep at
its interior, when, child as she was, the reflection struck her that she
would stand a better chance of carrying her point by remaining <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdue</i>.
Fortune for once favoured her: she crouched closer than before,
and saw her mother take something from one of the drawers,
which she handed over to the leech. Strange mutterings followed,
and words whose sound was foreign to her youthful ears. Had she
been older, their import, perhaps, might have been equally unknown.&mdash;After
a while there was a pause; and then the lady, as in answer to
a requisition from the gentleman, placed in his hand a something
which she took from her toilette. The transaction, whatever its nature,
seemed now to be complete, and the article was carefully replaced
in the drawer from which it had been taken. A long and apparently
interesting conversation then took place between the parties,
carried on in a low tone. At its termination, Mistress Marsh and
Master Erasmus Buckthorne quitted the boudoir together. But the
cabinet!&mdash;ay, that was left unfastened; the folding-doors still remained
invitingly expanded, the bunch of keys dangling from the lock. In
an instant the spoiled child was in a chair; the drawer so recently
closed yielded at once to her hand, and her hurried researches were
rewarded by the prettiest little waxen doll imaginable. It was a first-rate
prize, and Miss lost no time in appropriating it to herself. Long
before Madam Marsh had returned to her <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanctum</i>, Marian was
seated under a laurestinus in the garden, nursing her new baby with
the most affectionate solicitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Susan, look here; see what a nasty scratch I have got upon my
hand," said the young lady, when routed out at length from her
hiding-place to her noontide meal.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, this is always the way with you! mend, mend, mend,&mdash;nothing
but mend! Scrambling about among the bushes, and tearing
your clothes to rags. What with you, and with madam's farthingales
and kirtles, a poor bower-maiden has a fine time of it!"</p>

<p>"But I have not torn my clothes, Susan, and it was not the
bushes; it was the doll: only see what a great ugly pin I have pulled
out of it! and look, here is another!" As she spoke, Marian drew
forth one of those extended pieces of black pointed wire, with which,
in the days of toupees and pompoons, our foremothers were wont to
secure their fly-caps and head-gear from the impertinent assaults of
Zephyrus and the "Little Breezes."</p>

<p>"And pray, Miss, where did you get this pretty doll, as you call
it?" asked Susan, turning over the puppet, and viewing it with a
scrutinizing eye.</p>

<p>"Mamma gave it me," said the child.&mdash;This was a fib!</p>

<p>"Indeed!" quoth the girl thoughtfully; and then, in half soliloquy,
and a lower key, "Well! I wish I may die if it doesn't look
like my master!&mdash;But come to your dinner, miss. Hark! the <em>bell is
striking One</em>!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Master Thomas Marsh, and his man Ralph, were
threading the devious paths, then, as now, most pseudonymously dignified
with the name of roads, that wound between Marshton-Hall
and the frontier of Romney Marsh. Their progress was comparatively
slow; for, though the brown mare was as good a roadster as
man might back, and the gelding no mean nag of his hands, yet the
tracks, rarely traversed save by the rude wains of the day, miry in
the "bottoms," and covered with loose and rolling stones on the
higher grounds, rendered barely passable the perpetual alternation
of hill and valley.</p>

<p>The master rode on in pain, and the man in listlessness; although
the intercourse between two individuals so situated was much less restrained
in those days than might suit the refinement of a later age,
little passed approximating to conversation beyond an occasional and
half-stifled groan from the one, or a vacant whistle from the other.
An hour's riding had brought them among the woods of Acryse; and
they were about to descend one of those green and leafy lanes, rendered
by matted and over-arching branches alike impervious to
shower or sunbeam, when a sudden and violent spasm seized on Master
Marsh, and nearly caused him to fall from his horse. With some
difficulty he succeeded in dismounting, and seating himself by the road
side. Here he remained for a full half-hour in great apparent agony;
the cold sweat rolled in large round drops adown his clammy forehead,
a universal shivering palsied every limb, his eye-balls appeared
to be starting from their sockets, and to his attached, though dull
and heavy serving-man, he seemed as one struggling in the pangs of
impending dissolution. His groans rose thick and frequent; and the
alarmed Ralph was hesitating between his disinclination to leave him,
and his desire to procure such assistance as one of the few cottages,
rarely sprinkled in that wild country, might afford, when, after a long-drawn
sigh, his master's features as suddenly relaxed: he declared himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
better, the pang had passed away, and, to use his own expression,
he "felt as if a knife had been drawn from out his very heart." With
Ralph's assistance, after a while, he again reached his saddle; and,
though still ill at ease from a deep-seated and gnawing pain, which
ceased not, as he averred, to torment him, the violence of the paroxysm
was spent, and it returned no more.</p>

<p>Master and man pursued their way with increased speed, as,
emerging from the wooded defiles, they at length neared the coast;
then, leaving the romantic castle of Saltwood, with its neighbouring
town of Hithe, a little on their left, they proceeded along the ancient
paved causeway, and, crossing the old Roman road, or Watling,
plunged again into the woods that stretched between Lympne and
Ostenhanger.</p>

<p>The sun rode high in the heavens, and its meridian blaze was powerfully
felt by man and horse, when, again quitting their leafy covert,
the travellers debouched on the open plain of Aldington Frith, a wide
tract of unenclosed country stretching down to the very borders of
"the Marsh" itself. Here it was, in the neighbouring chapelry, the
site of which may yet be traced by the curious antiquary, that Elizabeth
Barton, the "Holy Maid of Kent," had, something less than a
hundred years previous to the period of our narrative, commenced
that series of supernatural pranks which eventually procured for her
head an unenvied elevation upon London Bridge; and, though the
parish had since enjoyed the benefit of the incumbency of Master
Erasmus's illustrious and enlightened Namesake, yet, truth to tell,
some of the old leaven was even yet supposed to be at work. The
place had, in fact, an ill name; and, though Popish miracles had
ceased to electrify its denizens, spells and charms, operating by a no
less wondrous agency, were said to have taken their place. Warlocks,
and other unholy subjects of Satan, were reported to make its
wild recesses their favourite rendezvous, and that to an extent which
eventually attracted the notice of no less a personage than the sagacious
Matthew Hopkins himself, Witchfinder-General to the British
government.</p>

<p>A great portion of the Frith, or Fright, as the name was then, and
is still, pronounced, had formerly been a Chace, with rights of Free-warren,
&amp;c. appertaining to the Archbishops of the Province. Since
the Reformation, however, it had been disparked; and when Master
Thomas Marsh, and his man Ralph, entered upon its confines, the
open greensward exhibited a lively scene, sufficiently explanatory of
certain sounds that had already reached their ears while yet within
the sylvan screen which concealed their origin.</p>

<p>It was Fair-day: booths, stalls, and all the rude <em>paraphernalia</em> of an
assembly that then met as much for the purposes of traffic as festivity,
were scattered irregularly over the turf; pedlars, with their
packs; horse-croupers, pig-merchants, itinerant vendors of crockery
and cutlery, wandered promiscuously among the mingled groups, exposing
their several wares and commodities, and soliciting custom.
On one side was the gaudy riband, making its mute appeal to rustic
gallantry; on the other the delicious brandy-ball and alluring lollipop,
compounded after the most approved receipt in the "True Gentlewoman's
Garland," and "raising the waters" in the mouth of many
an expectant urchin.</p>

<p>Nor were rural sports wanting to those whom pleasure, rather than
business, had drawn from their humble homes. Here was the tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and slippery pole, glittering in its grease, and crowned with the ample
cheese, that mocked the hopes of the discomfited climber. There
the fugitive pippin, swimming in water not of the purest, and bobbing
from the expanded lips of the juvenile Tantalus. In this quarter the
ear was pierced by squeaks from some beleaguered porker, whisking
his well-soaped tail from the grasp of one already in fancy his captor.
In that, the eye rested, with undisguised delight, upon the grimaces
of grinning candidates for the honours of the horse-collar. All was
fun, frolic, courtship, junketing, and jollity.</p>

<p>Maid Marian, indeed, with her lieges, Robin Hood, Scarlet, and
Little John, was wanting; Friar Tuck was absent; even the Hobby-horse
had disappeared: but the agile Morrice-dancers yet were there,
and jingled their bells merrily among stalls well stored with gingerbread,
tops, whips, whistles, and all those noisy instruments of domestic
torture in which scenes like these are even now so fertile.&mdash;Had
I a foe whom I held at deadliest feud, I would entice his child
to a Fair, and buy him a Whistle and a Penny-trumpet!</p>

<p>In one corner of the green, a little apart from the thickest of the
throng, stood a small square stage, nearly level with the chins of
the spectators, whose repeated bursts of laughter seemed to intimate
the presence of something more than usually amusing. The
platform was divided into two unequal portions; the smaller of which,
surrounded by curtains of a coarse canvass, veiled from the eyes of
the profane the <em>penetralia</em> of this moveable temple of Esculapius, for
such it was. Within its interior, and secure from vulgar curiosity,
the Quack-salver had hitherto kept himself ensconced; occupied, no
doubt, in the preparation and arrangement of that wonderful <em>panacea</em>
which was hereafter to shed the blessings of health among the admiring
crowd. Meanwhile his attendant Jack-pudding was busily
employed on the <em>proscenium</em>, doing his best to attract attention by a
practical facetiousness which took wonderfully with the spectators,
interspersing it with the melodious notes of a huge cow's horn. The
fellow's costume varied but little in character from that in which the
late&mdash;(alas! that we should have to write the word!)&mdash;the late Mr.
Joseph Grimaldi was accustomed to present himself before "a generous
and enlightened public:" the principal difference consisted in
this, that the upper garment was a long white tunic of a coarse linen,
surmounted by a caricature of the ruff then fast falling into disuse,
and was secured from the throat downwards by a single row of broad
white metal buttons. His legs were cased in loose wide trousers of
the same material; while his sleeves, prolonged to a most disproportionate
extent, descended far below the fingers, and acted as flappers
in the summersets and caracoles with which he diversified and enlivened
his antics. Consummate impudence, not altogether unmixed with a
certain sly humour, sparkled in his eye through the chalk and ochre
with which his features were plentifully bedaubed; and especially displayed
itself in a succession of jokes, the coarseness of which did not
seem to detract from their merit in the eyes of his applauding audience.</p>

<p>He was in the midst of a long and animated harangue explanatory
of his master's high pretensions; he had informed his gaping auditors
that the latter was the seventh son of a seventh son, and of course,
as they very well knew, an Unborn Doctor; that to this happy accident
of birth he added the advantage of most extensive travel; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in his search after science he had not only perambulated the whole of
this world, but had trespassed on the boundaries of the next; that
the depths of Ocean and the bowels of the Earth were alike familiar
to him; that besides salves and cataplasms of sovereign virtue, by
combining sundry mosses, gathered many thousand fathom below the
surface of the sea, with certain unknown drugs found in an undiscovered
island, and boiling the whole in the lava of Vesuvius, he had
succeeded in producing his celebrated balsam of Crackapanoko, the
never-failing remedy for all human disorders, and which, a proper
trial allowed, would go near to reanimate the dead. "Draw near!"
continued the worthy, "draw near, my masters! and you, my good
mistresses, draw near, every one of you! Fear not high and haughty
carriage; though greater than King or Kaiser, yet is the mighty Aldrovando
milder than mother's milk; flint to the proud, to the humble
he is as melting wax; he asks not your disorders, he sees them himself
at a glance&mdash;nay, without a glance; he tells your ailments with his
eyes shut! Draw near! draw near! the more incurable the better!
List to the illustrious Doctor Aldrovando, first Physician to Prester
John, Leech to the Grand Llama, and Hakim in Ordinary to Mustapha
Muley Bey!"</p>

<p>"Hath your master ever a charm for the toothache, an't please
you?" asked an elderly countryman, whose swollen cheek bespoke
his interest in the question.</p>

<p>"A charm!&mdash;a thousand, and every one of them infallible. Toothache,
quotha! I had hoped you had come with every bone in your
body fractured or out of joint. A toothache!&mdash;propound a tester,
master o' mine,&mdash;we ask not more for such trifles: do my bidding,
and thy jaws, even with the word, shall cease to trouble thee!"</p>

<p>The clown, fumbling a while in a deep leathern purse, at length
produced a sixpence, which he tendered to the jester. "Now to thy
master, and bring me the charm forthwith."</p>

<p>"Nay, honest man; to disturb the mighty Aldrovando on such
slight occasion were pity of my life: areed my counsel aright, and I
will warrant thee for the nonce. Hie thee home, friend; infuse this
powder in cold spring-water, fill thy mouth with the mixture, and sit
upon thy fire till it boils!"</p>

<p>"Out on thee for a pestilent knave!" cried the cozened countryman;
but the roar of merriment around bespoke the by-standers
well pleased with the jape put upon him. He retired, venting his
spleen in audible murmurs; and the mountebank, finding the feelings
of the mob enlisted on his side, waxed more impudent every instant,
filling up the intervals between his fooleries with sundry capers and
contortions, and discordant notes from the cow's horn.</p>

<p>"Draw near! draw near, my masters! Here have ye a remedy
for every evil under the sun, moral, physical, natural, and supernatural!
Hath any man a termagant wife?&mdash;here is that will tame her
presently! Hath any one a smoky chimney?&mdash;here is an incontinent
cure!"</p>

<p>To the first infliction no man ventured to plead guilty, though
there were those standing by who thought their neighbours might
have profited withal. For the last-named recipe started forth at least
a dozen candidates. With the greatest imaginable gravity, Pierrot,
having pocketed their groats, delivered to each a small packet curiously
folded and closely sealed, containing, as he averred, directions which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
if truly observed, would preclude any chimney from smoking for a
whole year. They whose curiosity led them to dive into the mystery,
found that a sprig of mountain ash culled by moonlight was the
charm recommended, coupled, however, with the proviso that no fire
should be lighted on the hearth during the interval.</p>

<p>The frequent bursts of merriment proceeding from this quarter at
length attracted the attention of Master Marsh, whose line of road
necessarily brought him near this end of the fair; he drew bit in
front of the stage just as its noisy occupant, having laid aside his formidable
horn, was drawing still more largely on the amazement of
"the public" by a feat of especial wonder,&mdash;he was eating fire!
Curiosity mingled with astonishment was at its height; and feelings
not unallied to alarm were beginning to manifest themselves among
the softer sex especially, as they gazed on the flames that issued
from the mouth of the living volcano. All eyes indeed were fixed
upon the fire-eater with an intentness that left no room for observing
another worthy who had now emerged upon the scene. This was,
however, no less a personage than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus ex machinâ</i>,&mdash;the illustrious
Aldrovando himself. Short in stature and spare in form, the
sage had somewhat increased the former by a steeple-crowned hat
adorned with a cock's feather; while the thick shoulder padding of a
quilted doublet, surmounted by a falling band, added a little to his
personal importance in point of breadth. His habit was composed
throughout of black serge, relieved with scarlet slashes in the sleeves
and trunks; red was the feather in his hat, red were the roses in his
shoes, which rejoiced, moreover, in a pair of red heels. The lining
of a short cloak of faded velvet, that hung transversely over his left
shoulder, was also red. Indeed, from all that we could ever see or
hear, this agreeable alternation of red and black appears to be the
mixture of colours most approved at the court of Beelzebub, and the
one most generally adopted by his friends and favourites. His features
were sharp and shrewd, and a fire sparkled in his keen grey
eye much at variance with the wrinkles that ran their irregular furrows
above his prominent and bushy brows. He had advanced slowly
from behind his screen while the attention of the multitude was absorbed
by the pyrotechnics of Mr. Merryman, and, stationing himself
at the extreme corner of the stage, stood quietly leaning on a crutch-handled
walking-staff of blackest ebony, his glance steadily fixed on
the face of Marsh, from whose countenance the amusement he had
insensibly begun to derive had not succeeded in removing all traces
of bodily pain. For a while the latter was unobservant of the inquisitorial
survey with which he was regarded; the eyes of the parties,
however, at length met. The brown mare had a fine shoulder; she
stood pretty near sixteen hands. Marsh himself, though slightly
bowed by ill health and the "coming autumn" of life, was full six
feet in height. His elevation giving him an unobstructed view over
the heads of the pedestrians, he had naturally fallen into the rear of
the assembly, which brought him close to the diminutive Doctor, with
whose face, despite the red heels, his own was about upon a level.</p>

<p>"And what makes Master Marsh here?&mdash;what sees he in the
mummeries of a miserable buffoon to divert him when his life is in
jeopardy?" said a shrill cracked voice that sounded as in his very ear.
It was the Doctor who spoke.</p>

<p>"Knowest thou me, friend?" said Marsh, scanning with awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
interest the figure of his questioner: "I call thee not to mind; and
yet&mdash;stay, where have we met?"</p>

<p>"It skills not to declare," was the answer; "suffice it we <em>have</em>
met,&mdash;in other climes, perchance,&mdash;and now meet happily again,&mdash;happily
at least for thee."</p>

<p>"Why truly the trick of thy countenance reminds me of somewhat
I have seen before, where or when I know not; but what wouldst
thou with me?"</p>

<p>"Nay, rather what wouldst thou here, Thomas Marsh? What
wouldst thou on the Frith of Aldington?&mdash;is it a score or two of
paltry sheep? or is it something <em>nearer to thy heart</em>?"</p>

<p>Marsh started as the last words were pronounced with more than
common significance: a pang shot through him at the moment, and
the vinegar aspect of the <em>Charlatan</em> seemed to relax into a smile half
compassionate, half sardonic.</p>

<p>"Grammercy," quoth Marsh, after a long-drawn breath, "what
knowest thou of me, fellow, or of my concerns? What knowest
thou&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This know I, Master Thomas Marsh," said the stranger gravely,
"that thy life is even now perilled: evil practices are against thee;
but no matter, thou art quit for the nonce&mdash;other hands than
mine have saved thee! Thy pains are over. Hark! <em>the clock strikes
One!</em>" As he spoke, a single toll from the bell-tower of Bilsington
came, wafted by the western breeze, over the thick-set and lofty oaks
which intervened between the Frith and what had been once a
priory. Dr. Aldrovando turned as the sound came floating on the
wind, and was moving, as if half in anger, towards the other side of
the stage, where the mountebank, his fires extinct, was now disgorging
to the admiring crowd yard after yard of gaudy-coloured riband.</p>

<p>"Stay! Nay, prithee, stay!" cried Marsh eagerly, "I was wrong;
in faith I was. A change, and that a sudden and most marvellous, hath
come over me; I am free; I breathe again; I feel as though a load
of years had been removed; and&mdash;is it possible?&mdash;hast thou done
this?"</p>

<p>"Thomas Marsh!" said the doctor, pausing, and turning for the
moment on his heel, "I have <em>not</em>; I repeat, that other and more
innocent hands than mine have done this deed. Nevertheless, heed
my counsel well! Thou art parlously encompassed; I, and I only,
have the means of relieving thee. Follow thy courses; pursue thy
journey; but, as thou valuest life, and more than life, be at the foot of
yonder woody knoll what time the rising moon throws her first beam
upon the bare and blighted summit that towers above its trees."</p>

<p>He crossed abruptly to the opposite quarter of the scaffolding, and
was in an instant deeply engaged in listening to those whom the
cow's horn had attracted, and in prescribing for their real or fancied
ailments. Vain were all Marsh's efforts again to attract his notice;
it was evident that he studiously avoided him; and when, after
an hour or more spent in useless endeavour, he saw the object of his
anxiety seclude himself once more within his canvass screen, he
rode slowly and thoughtfully off the field.&mdash;What should he do?
Was the man a mere quack? an impostor? His name thus obtained!&mdash;that
might be easily done. But then, his secret griefs; the doctor's
knowledge of them; their cure: for he felt that his pains were gone,
his healthful feelings restored! True; Aldrovando, if that were his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
name, had disclaimed all co-operation in his recovery: but he knew or,
he announced it. Nay, more; he had hinted that he was yet in jeopardy;
that practices&mdash;and the chord sounded strangely in unison with
one that had before vibrated within him&mdash;that practices were in operation
against his life! It was enough! He would keep tryst with
the Conjuror, if conjuror he were; and, at least, ascertain who and
what he was, and how he had become acquainted with his own person
and secret afflictions.</p>

<p>When the late Mr. Pitt was determined to keep out Buonaparte,
and prevent his gaining a settlement in the county of Kent, among
other ingenious devices adopted for that purpose, he caused to be
constructed what was then, and has ever since been, conventionally
termed a "Military canal." This is a not very practicable ditch,
some thirty feet wide, and nearly nine feet deep&mdash;in the middle, extending
from the town and port of Hithe to within a mile of the town
and port of Rye, a distance of about twenty miles; and forming, as it
were, the cord of a bow, the area of which constitutes that remote
fifth quarter of the globe spoken of by travellers. Trivial objections
to the plan were made at the time by cavillers; and an old gentleman
of the neighbourhood, who proposed, as a cheap substitute, to put up
his own cocked-hat upon a pole, was deservedly pooh-pooh'd down;
in fact, the job, though rather an expensive one, was found to answer
remarkably well. The French managed, indeed, to scramble over the
Rhine, and the Rhone, and other insignificant currents; but they never
did, or could, pass Mr. Pitt's "Military canal." At no great distance
from the centre of this cord rises abruptly a sort of woody promontory,
in shape almost conical, its sides covered with thick underwood;
above which is seen a bare and brown summit rising like an
Alp in miniature. The "defence of the nation" not being then in
existence, Master Thomas Marsh met with no obstruction in reaching
this place of appointment long before the time prescribed.</p>

<p>So much, indeed, was his mind occupied by his adventure and extraordinary
cure, that his original design had been abandoned, and
Master Cobbe remained unvisited. A rude hostel in the neighbourhood
furnished entertainment for man and horse; and here, a full
hour before the rising of the moon, he left Ralph and the other beasts,
proceeding to his rendezvous on foot and alone.</p>

<p>"You are punctual, Master Marsh," squeaked the shrill voice of
the Doctor, issuing from the thicket as the first silvery gleam trembled
on the aspens above. "'Tis well; now follow me, and in silence."</p>

<p>The first part of the command Marsh hesitated not to obey; the
second was more difficult of observance.</p>

<p>"Who and what are you? Whither are you leading me?" burst
not unnaturally from his lips; but all question was at once cut short
by the peremptory tones of his guide.</p>

<p>"Hush! I say; your finger on your lip; there be hawks abroad:
follow me, and that silently and quickly." The little man turned as
he spoke, and led the way through a scarcely perceptible path, or
track, which wound among the underwood. The lapse of a few minutes
brought them to the door of a low building so hidden by the
surrounding trees that few would have suspected its existence. It
was a cottage of rather extraordinary dimensions, but consisting of
only one floor. No smoke rose from its solitary chimney; no cheering
ray streamed from its single window, which was, however, secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
by a shutter of such thickness as to preclude the possibility of any
stray beam issuing from within. The exact size of the building it
was in that uncertain light difficult to distinguish, a portion of it
seeming buried in the wood behind. The door gave way on the application
of a key, and Marsh followed his conductor resolutely but
cautiously along a narrow passage feebly lighted by a small taper
that winked and twinkled at its farther extremity. The Doctor, as he
approached, raised it from the ground, and, opening an adjoining door,
ushered his guest into the room beyond. It was a large and oddly-furnished
apartment, insufficiently lighted by an iron lamp that hung
from the roof, and scarcely illumined the walls and angles, which
seemed to be composed of some dark-coloured wood. On one side,
however, Master Marsh could discover an article bearing strong resemblance
to a coffin; on the other was a large oval mirror in an
ebony frame, and in the midst of the floor was described in red chalk
a double circle, about six feet in diameter, its inner verge inscribed
with sundry hieroglyphics, agreeably relieved at intervals with an alternation
of skulls and cross-bones. In the very centre was deposited
one skull of such surpassing size and thickness as would have filled
the soul of a Spurzheim or De Ville with wonderment. A large
book, a naked sword, an hour-glass, a chafing-dish, and a black cat,
completed the list of moveables; with the exception of a couple of
tapers which stood on each side the mirror, and which the strange
gentleman now proceeded to light from the one in his hand. As
they flared up with what Marsh thought a most unnatural brilliancy,
he perceived, reflected in the glass behind, a dial suspended over the
coffin-like article already mentioned: the hand was fast verging towards
the hour of nine. The eyes of the little Doctor seemed rivetted
on the horologe.</p>

<p>"Now strip thee, Master Marsh, and that quickly: untruss, I say!
discard thy boots, doff doublet and hose, and place thyself incontinent
in yonder bath." The visitor cast his eyes again upon the formidable-looking
article, and perceived that it was nearly filled with water.
A cold bath, at such an hour and under such auspices, was anything
but inviting: he hesitated, and turned his eyes alternately on the
Doctor and the Black Cat.</p>

<p>"Trifle not the time, man, an you be wise," said the former:
"Passion of my heart! let but yon minute-hand reach the hour, and,
thou not immersed, thy life were not worth a pin's fee!"</p>

<p>The Black Cat gave vent to a single Mew,&mdash;a most unnatural
sound for a mouser,&mdash;it seemed as it were mewed through a cow's
horn!</p>

<p>"Quick, Master Marsh! uncase, or you perish!" repeated his
strange host, throwing as he spoke a handful of some dingy-looking
powders into the brasier. "Behold, the attack is begun!" A thick
cloud rose from the embers; a cold shivering shook the astonished
Yeoman: sharp pricking pains penetrated his ankles and the palms of
his hands, and, as the smoke cleared away, he distinctly saw and recognised
in the mirror the boudoir of Marshton Hall. The doors of
the well-known ebony cabinet were closed; but, fixed against them,
and standing out in strong relief from the contrast afforded by the
sable background, was a waxen image&mdash;of himself! It appeared to
be secured and sustained in an upright posture by large black pins
driven through the feet and palms, the latter of which were extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in a cruciform position. To the right and left stood his wife
and José; in the middle, with his back towards him, was a figure
which he had no difficulty in recognising as that of the Leech of
Folkestone. It had just succeeded in fastening the dexter hand of
the image, and was now in the act of drawing a broad and keen-edged
sabre from its sheath. The Black Cat mewed again. "Haste,
or you die!" said the Doctor. Marsh looked at the dial; it wanted
but four minutes of nine: he felt that the crisis of his fate was come.
Off went his heavy boots; doublet to the right, galligaskins to the
left; never was man more swiftly disrobed: in two minutes, to use
an Indian expression, "he was all face!" in another, he was on his
back, and up to his chin, in a bath which smelt strongly as of brimstone
and garlick.</p>

<p>"Heed well the clock!" cried the Conjuror: "with the first stroke
of Nine plunge thy head beneath the water; suffer not a hair above
the surface: plunge deeply, or you are lost!"</p>

<p>The little man had seated himself in the centre of the circle upon
the large skull, elevating his legs at an angle of forty-five degrees. In
this position he spun round with a velocity to be equalled only by that
of a tee-totum, the red roses on his insteps seeming to describe a circle
of fire. The best buckskins that ever mounted at Melton had soon
yielded to such rotatory friction; but he spun on, the Cat mewed,
bats and obscene birds fluttered over head, Erasmus was seen to
raise his weapon, the clock struck!&mdash;and Marsh, who had "ducked"
at the instant, popped up his head again, spitting and sputtering, half
choked with the infernal mixture, which had insinuated itself into
his mouth, and ears, and nose. All disgust at his nauseous dip was,
however, at once removed, when, casting his eyes on the glass, he
saw the consternation of the party whose persons it exhibited.
Erasmus had evidently made his blow and failed; the figure was unmutilated;
the hilt remained in the hand of the striker, while the
shivered blade lay in shining fragments on the floor.</p>

<p>The Conjuror ceased his spinning, and brought himself to an anchor;
the Black Cat purred,&mdash;its purring seemed strangely mixed with
the self-satisfied chuckle of a human being. Where had Marsh heard
something like it before?</p>

<p>He was rising from his unsavoury couch, when a motion from the
little man checked him. "Rest where you are, Thomas Marsh; so
far all goes well, but the danger is not yet over!" He looked again,
and perceived that the shadowy triumvirate were in deep and eager
consultation; the fragments of the shattered weapon appeared to undergo
a close scrutiny. The result was clearly unsatisfactory; the
lips of the parties moved rapidly, and much gesticulation might be
observed, but no sound fell upon the ear. The hand of the dial had
nearly reached the quarter: at once the parties separated; and Buckthorne
stood again before the figure, his hand armed with a long and
sharp-pointed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">misericorde</i>, a dagger little in use of late, but such as, a
century before, often performed the part of a modern oyster-knife, in
tickling the osteology of a dismounted cavalier through the shelly defences
of his plate-armour. Again he raised his arm. "Duck!"
roared the Doctor, spinning away upon his cephalic pivot: the Black
Cat cocked his tail, and seemed to mew the word "Duck!" Down
went Master Marsh's head; but one of his hands had unluckily been
resting on the edge of the bath: he drew it hastily in, but not altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
scathless; the stump of a rusty nail, projecting from the margin
of the bath, had caught and slightly grazed it. The pain was more
acute than is usually produced by such trivial accident; and Marsh,
on once more raising his head, beheld the dagger of the leech sticking
in the little finger of the wax figure, which it had seemingly nailed
to the cabinet door.</p>

<p>"By my truly, a scape o' the narrowest!" quoth the Conjuror;
"the next course, dive you not the readier, there is no more life in
you than in a pickled herring. What! courage, Master Marsh; but
be heedful: an they miss again, let them bide the issue!" He drew
his hand athwart his brow as he spoke, and dashed off the perspiration,
which the violence of his exercise had drawn from every pore.
Black Tom sprang upon the edge of the bath, and stared full in the
face of the bather: his sea-green eyes were lambent with unholy fire,
but their marvellous obliquity of vision was not to be mistaken,&mdash;the
very countenance, too!&mdash;Could it be?&mdash;the features were feline, but
their expression that of the Jack-Pudding? Was the Mountebank a
Cat, or the Cat a Mountebank?&mdash;it was all a mystery; and Heaven
knows how long Marsh might have continued staring at Grimalkin, had
not his attention been again called by Aldrovando to the magic mirror.
Great dissatisfaction, not to say dismay, seemed to pervade the conspirators;
Dame Isabel was closely inspecting the figure's wounded
hand, while José was aiding the pharmacopolist to charge a huge
petronel with powder and bullets. The load was a heavy one; but
Erasmus seemed determined this time to make sure of his object.
Somewhat of trepidation might be observed in his manner as he rammed
down the balls, and his withered cheek appeared to have acquired
an increase of paleness; but amazement rather than fear was the prevailing
symptom, and his countenance betrayed no jot of irresolution.
As the clock was about to chime half-past nine, he planted himself
with a firm foot in front of the image, waved his unoccupied hand
with a cautionary gesture to his companions, and, as they hastily retired
on either side, brought the muzzle of his weapon within half a
foot of his mark. As the shadowy form was about to draw the trigger,
Marsh again plunged his head beneath the surface; and the
sound of an explosion, as of fire-arms, mingled with the rush of water
that poured into his ears. His immersion was but momentary, yet
did he feel as though half suffocated: he sprang from the bath, and,
as his eye fell on the mirror, he saw, or thought he saw, the Leech of
Folkestone lying dead on the floor of his wife's boudoir, his head shattered
to pieces, and his hand still grasping the stock of a bursten
petronel. He saw no more; his head swam, his senses reeled, the
whole room was turning round, and, as he fell to the ground, the last
impressions to which he was conscious were the chucklings of a
hoarse laughter and the mewings of a Tom Cat.</p>

<p>Master Marsh was found the next morning by his bewildered
serving-man, stretched before the door of the humble hostel at which
he sojourned. His clothes were somewhat torn and much bemired;
and deeply did honest Ralph marvel that one so staid and grave as
Marsh of Marston should thus have played the roisterer, missing
perchance a profitable bargain for the drunken orgies of midnight wassail,
or the endearments of some rustic light-o'-love. Tenfold was
his astonishment increased when, after retracing in silence their journey
of the preceding day, the Hall, on their arrival about noon, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
found in a state of uttermost confusion. No wife stood there to greet
with the smile of bland affection her returning spouse; no page to
hold his stirrup, or receive his gloves, his hat, and riding-rod. The
doors were open, the rooms in most admired disorder; men and
maidens peeping, hurrying hither and thither, and popping in and
out, like rabbits in a warren. The lady of the mansion was nowhere
to be found.</p>

<p>José, too, had disappeared: the latter had been last seen riding
furiously towards Folkestone early in the preceding afternoon; to a
question from Hodge Gardener he had hastily answered, that he bore
a missive of moment from his mistress. The lean apprentice of
Erasmus Buckthorne declared that the page had summoned his master
in haste about six of the clock, and that they had rode forth
together, as he very believed, on their way back to the Hall, where
he had supposed Master Buckthorne's services to be suddenly required
on some pressing emergency. Since that time he had seen
nought of either of them: the grey cob, however, had returned late
at night, masterless, with his girths loose, and the saddle turned upside
down.</p>

<p>Nor was Master Erasmus Buckthorne ever seen again. Strict
search was made through the neighbourhood, but without success; and
it was at length presumed that he must, for reasons which nobody
could divine, have absconded with José and his faithless mistress.
The latter had carried off with her the strong box, divers articles
of valuable plate, and jewels of price. Her boudoir appeared to have
been completely ransacked; the cabinet and drawers stood open, and
empty; the very carpet, a luxury then newly introduced into England,
was gone. Marsh, however, could trace no vestige of the visionary
scene which he affirmed to have been last night presented to
his eyes. Much did the neighbours marvel at his story: some
thought him mad; others, that he was merely indulging in that privilege
to which, as a traveller, he had a right indefeasible. Trusty
Ralph said nothing, but shrugged his shoulders; and, falling into
the rear, imitated the action of raising the wine-cup to his lips.
An opinion, indeed, soon prevailed, that Master Thomas Marsh had
gotten, in common parlance, exceedingly drunk on the preceding
evening, and dreamt all that he had so circumstantially related.
This belief acquired additional credit when they whom curiosity induced
to visit the woody knoll of Aldington Mount declared that
they could find no building such as that described; nor any cottage
near, save one, indeed, a low-roofed hovel, once a house of public
entertainment, but now half in ruins. The "Old Cat and Fiddle"&mdash;so
was the tenement called&mdash;had been long uninhabited; yet still
exhibited the remains of a broken sign, on which the keen observer
might decypher something like a rude portrait of the animal
from which it derived its name. It was also supposed still to afford
an occasional asylum to the smugglers of the coast, but no trace
of any visit from sage or mountebank could be detected; nor was the
wise Aldrovando, whom many remembered to have seen at the fair,
ever found again on all that country-side. Of the runaways nothing
was ever certainly known. A boat, the property of an old fisherman
who plied his trade on the outskirts of the town, had been seen to quit
the bay that night; and there were those who declared that she had
more hands on board than Carden and his son, her usual complement;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
but, as a gale came on, and the frail bark was eventually found keel
upwards on the Goodwin Sands, it was presumed that she had struck
on that fatal quicksand in the dark, and that all on board had
perished.</p>

<p>Little Marian, whom her profligate mother had abandoned, grew
up to be a fine girl, and a handsome. She became, moreover, heiress
to Marshton Hall, and brought the estate into the Ingoldsby family
by her marriage with one of its scions.</p>

<p>It is a little singular that, on pulling down the old Hall in my
grandfather's time, a human skeleton was discovered among the
rubbish, under what particular part of the building I could never
with any accuracy ascertain; but it was found enveloped in a tattered
cloth, that seemed to have been once a carpet, and which fell
to pieces almost immediately on being exposed to the air. The bones
were perfect, but those of one hand were wanting; and the skull,
perhaps from the labourer's pick-axe, had received considerable
injury.</p>

<p>The portrait of the fair Marian hangs yet in the Gallery of Tappington;
and near it is another, of a young man in the prime of life,
whom Mrs. Botherby pronounces her father. It exhibits a mild
and rather melancholy countenance, with a high forehead, and the
picked beard and moustaches of the seventeenth century. The signet-finger
of the left hand is gone, and appears, on close inspection,
to have been painted out by some later artist; possibly in compliment
to the tradition, which, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">teste Botherby</i>, records that of Mr. Marsh to have
gangrened, and to have undergone amputation at the knuckle-joint. If
really the resemblance of the gentleman alluded to, it must have been
taken at some period antecedent to his marriage. There is neither
date nor painter's name; but, a little above the head, on the dexter
side of the picture, is an escutcheon, bearing Quarterly, Gules and
Argent; in the first quarter, a horse's head of the second; beneath
it are the words "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ætatis suæ</i>, 26." On the opposite side is the following
marks which Mr. Simpkinson declares to be that of a Merchant
of the Staple, and pretends to discover in the anagram comprised
in it all the characters which compose the name of THOMAS
MARSH, of MARSHTON.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.</h3>

<p class="center f90">IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF, THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE.
WITH SOME PARTICULARS CONCERNING A CERTAIN PICTURE.</p>


<p>The coach rattled away down Mount Pleasant and up Exmouth-street,&mdash;over
nearly the same ground as that which Oliver
had traversed when he first entered London in company with
the Dodger,&mdash;and, turning a different way when it reached the
Angel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house in a
quiet shady street near Pentonville. Here a bed was prepared
without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young
charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here he was
tended with a kindness and solicitude which knew no bounds.</p>

<p>But for many days Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness
of his new friends; the sun rose and sunk, and rose and
sunk again, and many times after that, and still the boy lay
stretched upon his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry
and wasting heat of fever,&mdash;that heat which, like the subtle acid
that gnaws into the very heart of hardest iron, burns only to
corrode and to destroy. The worm does not his work more
surely on the dead body, than does this slow, creeping fire upon
the living frame.</p>

<p>Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what
seemed to have been a long and troubled dream. Feebly raising
himself in the bed, with his head resting on his trembling
arm, he looked anxiously round.</p>

<p>"What room is this?&mdash;where have I been brought to?" said
Oliver. "This is not the place I went to sleep in."</p>

<p>He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and
weak; but they were overheard at once, for the curtain at the
bed's head was hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady,
very neatly and precisely dressed, rose as she undrew it, from
an arm-chair close by, in which she had been sitting at needle-work.</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear," said the old lady softly. "You must be
very quiet, or you will be ill again, and you have been very
bad,&mdash;as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh. Lie down again,
there's a dear." With these words the old lady very gently
placed Oliver's head upon the pillow, and, smoothing back his
hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and lovingly in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand
upon her's and drawing it round his neck.</p>

<div class="caption">Oliver recovering from Fever</div>
</div>

<p>"Save us!" said the old lady, with tears in her eyes, "what
a grateful little dear it is. Pretty creetur, what would his mother
feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him
now!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she does see me," whispered Oliver, folding his
hands together; "perhaps she has sat by me, ma'am. I almost
feel as if she had."</p>

<p>"That was the fever, my dear," said the old lady mildly.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was," replied Oliver thoughtfully, "because
Heaven is a long way off, and they are too happy there, to come
down to the bedside of a poor boy. But if she knew I was ill,
she must have pitied me even there, for she was very ill herself
before she died. She can't know anything about me though,"
added Oliver after a moment's silence, "for if she had seen me
beat, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always
looked sweet and happy when I have dreamt of her."</p>

<p>The old lady made no reply to this, but wiping her eyes first,
and her spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as
if they were part and parcel of those features, brought some
cool stuff for Oliver to drink, and then, patting him on the
cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again.</p>

<p>So Oliver kept very still, partly because he was anxious to
obey the kind old lady in all things, and partly, to tell the
truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had
already said. He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he
was awakened by the light of a candle, which, being brought
near the bed, showed him a gentleman, with a very large and
loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and
said he was a great deal better.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> a great deal better, are you not, my dear?" said
the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you are," said the gentleman: "you're hungry
too, an't you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered Oliver.</p>

<p>"Hem!" said the gentleman. "No, I know you're not.
He is not hungry, Mrs. Bedwin," said the gentleman, looking
very wise.</p>

<p>The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which
seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever
man. The doctor appeared very much of the same opinion
himself.</p>

<p>"You feel sleepy, don't you, my dear?" said the doctor.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"No," said the doctor with a very shrewd and satisfied look.
"You're not sleepy. Nor thirsty, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, rather thirsty," answered Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin," said the doctor. "It's
very natural that he should be thirsty&mdash;perfectly natural. You
may give him a little tea, ma'am, and some dry toast without
any butter. Don't keep him too warm, ma'am; but be careful
that you don't let him be too cold; will you have the goodness?"</p>

<p>The old lady dropped a curtsey; and the doctor, after tasting
the cool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval thereof, hurried
away: his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy
manner as he went down stairs.</p>

<p>Oliver dozed off again soon after this, and when he awoke it
was nearly twelve o'clock. The old lady tenderly bade him
good-night shortly afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat
old woman who had just come, bringing with her in a little
bundle a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap. Putting the
latter on her head, and the former on the table, the old woman,
after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew
her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps,
chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward
and divers moans and chokings, which, however, had no worse
effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall
asleep again.</p>

<p>And thus the night crept slowly on. Oliver lay awake for
some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection
of the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling, or tracing with
his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall.
The darkness and deep stillness of the room were very solemn;
and as they brought into the boy's mind the thought that death
had been hovering there for many days and nights, and might
yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence, he
turned his face upon the pillow and fervently prayed to Heaven.</p>

<p>Gradually he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease
from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful
rest which it is pain to wake from. Who, if this were death,
would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life,&mdash;to
all its cares for the present, its anxieties for the future,
and, more than all, its weary recollections of the past!</p>

<p>It had been bright day for hours when Oliver opened his eyes;
and when he did so, he felt cheerful and happy. The crisis
of the disease was safely past, and he belonged to the world
again.</p>

<p>In three days' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair well
propped up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk,
Mrs. Bedwin had him carried down stairs into the little housekeeper's
room, which belonged to her, where, having sat him
up by the fireside, the good old lady sat herself down too, and,
being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much
better, forthwith began to cry most violently.</p>

<p>"Never mind me, my dear," said the old lady; "I'm only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
having a regular good cry. There, it's all over now, and I'm
quite comfortable."</p>

<p>"You're very, very kind to me, ma'am," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"Well, never you mind that, my dear," said the old lady;
"that's got nothing to do with your broth, and it's full time you
had it, for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you
this morning, and we must get up our best looks, because the
better we look, the more he'll be pleased." And with this, the
old lady applied herself to warming up in a little saucepan a
basin full of broth strong enough to furnish an ample dinner,
when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and
fifty paupers, at the very lowest computation.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of pictures, dear?" inquired the old lady,
seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes most intently on a portrait
which hung against the wall just opposite his chair.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know, ma'am," said Oliver, without taking
his eyes from the canvass; "I have seen so few that I hardly
know. What a beautiful mild face that lady's is!"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the old lady, "painters always make ladies out
prettier than they are, or they wouldn't get any custom, child.
The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might
have known <em>that</em> would never succeed; it's a deal too honest,&mdash;a
deal," said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her own
acuteness.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is that a likeness, ma'am?" said Oliver.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the
broth; "that's a portrait."</p>

<p>"Whose, ma'am?" asked Oliver eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, really, my dear, I don't know," answered the old lady
in a good-humoured manner. "It's not a likeness of anybody
that you or I know, I expect. It seems to strike your fancy,
dear."</p>

<p>"It is so very pretty: so very beautiful," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"Why, sure you're not afraid of it?" said the old lady, observing
in great surprise the look of awe with which the child
regarded the painting.</p>

<p>"Oh no, no," returned Oliver quickly; "but the eyes look
so sorrowful, and where I sit they seem fixed upon me. It
makes my heart beat," added Oliver in a low voice, "as if it
was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn't."</p>

<p>"Lord save us!" exclaimed the old lady, starting; "don't
talk in that way, child. You're weak and nervous after your
illness. Let me wheel your chair round to the other side, and
then you won't see it. There," said the old lady, suiting the
action to the word; "you don't see it now, at all events."</p>

<p>Oliver <em>did</em> see it in his mind's eye as distinctly as if he had
not altered his position, but he thought it better not to worry
the kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him,
and Mrs. Bedwin, satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth with all the
bustle befitting so solemn a preparation. Oliver got through it
with extraordinary expedition, and had scarcely swallowed the
last spoonful when there came a soft tap at the door. "Come
in," said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.</p>

<p>Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but he
had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust
his hands behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good
long look at Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very
great variety of odd contortions. Oliver looked very worn and
shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand
up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his
sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth
must be told, that Mr. Brownlow's heart being large enough
for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced
a supply of tears into his eyes by some hydraulic process which
we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to
explain.</p>

<p>"Poor boy, poor boy!" said Mr. Brownlow clearing his
throat. "I'm rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin; I'm
afraid I have caught cold."</p>

<p>"I hope not, sir," said Mrs. Bedwin. "Everything you
have had has been well aired, sir."</p>

<p>"I don't know, Bedwin,&mdash;I don't know," said Mr. Brownlow;
"I rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday:
but never mind that. How do you feel, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Very happy, sir," replied Oliver, "and very grateful indeed,
sir, for your goodness to me,"</p>

<p>"Good boy," said Mr. Brownlow stoutly. "Have you given
him any nourishment, Bedwin?&mdash;any slops, eh?"</p>

<p>"He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir," replied
Mrs. Bedwin, drawing herself up slightly, and laying a
strong emphasis on the last word, to intimate that between
slops, and broth well compounded, there existed no affinity or
connexion whatsoever.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; "a
couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great
deal more good,&mdash;wouldn't they, Tom White,&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"My name is Oliver, sir," replied the little invalid with a
look of great astonishment.</p>

<p>"Oliver!" said Mr. Brownlow; "Oliver what? Oliver
White,&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, Twist,&mdash;Oliver Twist."</p>

<p>"Queer name," said the old gentleman. "What made you
tell the magistrate your name was White?"</p>

<p>"I never told him so, sir," returned Oliver in amazement.</p>

<p>This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman
looked somewhat sternly in Oliver's face. It was impossible to
doubt him; there was truth in every one of its thin and
sharpened lineaments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some mistake," said Mr. Brownlow. But, although his
motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the
old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar
face came upon him so strongly that he could not withdraw
his gaze.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not angry with me, sir," said Oliver, raising
his eyes beseechingly.</p>

<p>"No, no," replied the old gentleman.&mdash;"Gracious God, what's
this! Bedwin, look, look there!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture above Oliver's
head, and then to the boy's face. There was its living copy,&mdash;the
eyes, the head, the mouth; every feature was the same.
The expression was for the instant so precisely alike, that the
minutest line seemed copied with an accuracy which was perfectly
unearthly.</p>

<p>Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation, for
he was not strong enough to bear the start it gave him, and he
fainted away.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH</h3>

<p class="center f90">REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS,
THROUGH WHOM A NEW ACQUAINTANCE IS INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT
READER, AND CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS
ARE RELATED APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY.</p>

<p>When the Dodger and his accomplished friend Master Bates
joined in the hue and cry which was raised at Oliver's heels, in
consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr.
Brownlow's personal property, as hath been already described
with great perspicuity in a foregoing chapter, they were actuated,
as we therein took occasion to observe, by a very laudable
and becoming regard for themselves: and forasmuch as the
freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are
among the first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman,
so I need hardly beg the reader to observe that this action
must tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic
men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of
their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate
and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound
and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the
mainsprings of all Madam Nature's deeds and actions; the said
philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady's proceedings
to matters of maxim and theory, and, by a very neat and pretty
compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting
entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous
impulse and feeling, as matters totally beneath a female who is
acknowledged by universal admission to be so far beyond the
numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex.</p>

<p>If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very
delicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also
recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative) of their quitting
the pursuit when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver,
and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible
cut; for although I do not mean to assert that it is the practice
of renowned and learned sages at all to shorten the road to any
great conclusion, their course indeed being rather to lengthen
the distance by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings,
like those in which drunken men under the pressure of a
too mighty flow of ideas are prone to indulge, still I do mean to
say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of all
mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great
wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency
which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves.
Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong, and you
may take any means which the end to be attained will justify;
the amount of the right or the amount of the wrong, or indeed
the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher
concerned: to be settled and determined by his clear,
comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case.</p>

<p>It was not until the two boys had scoured with great rapidity
through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts,
that they ventured to halt by common consent beneath a low
and dark archway. Having remained silent here, just long
enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation
of amusement and delight, and, bursting into an uncontrollable
fit of laughter, flung himself upon a door-step, and
rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" inquired the Dodger.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" roared Charley Bates.</p>

<p>"Hold your noise," remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously
round. "Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?"</p>

<p>"I can't help it," said Charley, "I can't help it. To see
him splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners,
and knocking up against the posts, and starting on again as if
he was made of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my
pocket, singing out arter him&mdash;oh, my eye!" The vivid imagination
of Master Bates presented the scene before him in too
strong colours. As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again
rolled upon the door-step and laughed louder than before.</p>

<p>"What'll Fagin say?" inquired the Dodger, taking advantage
of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his
friend to propound the question.</p>

<p>"What!" repeated Charley Bates.</p>

<p>"Ah, what?" said the Dodger.</p>

<p>"Why, what should he say?" inquired Charley, stopping
rather suddenly in his merriment, for the Dodger's manner was
impressive; "what should he say?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes, and then,
taking off his hat, scratched his head and nodded thrice.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Charley.</p>

<p>"Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he
wouldn't, and high cockolorum," said the Dodger with a slight
sneer on his intellectual countenance.</p>

<p>This was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Mr. Bates felt
it so, and again said, "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>The Dodger made no reply, but putting his hat on again,
and gathering the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arms,
thrust his tongue into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose
some half-dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner, and
then, turning on his heel, slunk down the court. Mr. Bates
followed, with a thoughtful countenance.</p>

<p>The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs a few minutes
after the occurrence of this conversation roused the merry old
gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf
in his left hand, a pocket-knife in his right, and a pewter pot
on the trivet. There was a rascally smile on his white face as
he turned round, and, looking sharply out from under his thick
red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door and listened intently.</p>

<p>"Why, how's this?" muttered the Jew, changing countenance;
"only two of 'em! Where's the third? They can't
have got into trouble. Hark!"</p>

<p>The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing,
the door was slowly opened, and the Dodger and Charley Bates
entered and closed it behind them.</p>

<p>"Where's Oliver, you young hounds?" said the furious Jew,
rising with a menacing look: "where's the boy?"</p>

<p>The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were
alarmed at his violence, and looked uneasily at each other, but
made no reply.</p>

<p>"What's become of the boy?" said the Jew, seizing the
Dodger tightly by the collar, and threatening him with horrid
imprecations. "Speak out, or I'll throttle you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley
Bates, who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side,
and conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his
turn to be throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised
a loud, well-sustained, and continuous roar, something between
an insane bull and a speaking-trumpet.</p>

<p>"Will you speak?" thundered the Jew, shaking the Dodger
so much that his keeping in the big coat at all seemed perfectly
miraculous.</p>

<p>"Why, the traps have got him, and that's all about it," said
the Dodger sullenly. "Come, let go o' me, will yer!" and,
swinging himself at one jerk clean out of the big coat, which he
left in the Jew's hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting-fork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and made a pass at the merry old gentleman's waistcoat,
which, if it had taken effect, would have let a little more merriment
out than could have been easily replaced in a month or
two.</p>

<p>The Jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility
than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude,
and, seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his
assailant's head. But Charley Bates at this moment calling his
attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he suddenly altered its
destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman.</p>

<p>"Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!" growled a deep
voice. "Who pitched that 'ere at me? It's well it's the beer
and not the pot as hit me, or I 'd have settled somebody. I
might have know'd as nobody but an infernal rich, plundering,
thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but
water, and not that, unless he done the River company every
quarter. Wot's it all about, Fagin. D&mdash;&mdash; me if my neckankecher
an't lined with beer. Come in, you sneaking warmint;
wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of
your master. Come in!"</p>

<p>The man who growled out these words was a stoutly-built
fellow of about five-and-forty, in a black velveteen coat, very
soiled drab breeches, lace-up half-boots, and grey cotton stockings,
which enclosed a very bulky pair of legs, with large swelling
calves,&mdash;the kind of legs which in such costume always look
in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to
garnish them. He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty
belcher handkerchief round his neck, with the long frayed ends
of which, he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke; disclosing
when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with
a beard of three days' growth, and two scowling eyes, one of
which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been
recently damaged by a blow.</p>

<p>"Come in, d'ye hear?" growled this engaging-looking ruffian.
A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty
different places, skulked into the room.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come in afore?" said the man. "You're
getting too proud to own me afore company, are you. Lie
down!"</p>

<p>This command was accompanied with a kick which sent the
animal to the other end of the room. He appeared well used
to it, however; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly
without uttering a sound, and, winking his very ill-looking eyes
about twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in
taking a survey of the apartment.</p>

<p>"What are you up to? Ill-treating the boys, you covetous,
avaricious, in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?" said the man, seating himself
deliberately. "I wonder they don't murder you; <em>I</em> would if
I was them. If I'd been your 'prentice I'd have done it long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
ago; and&mdash;no, I couldn't have sold you arterwards, though; for
you're fit for nothing but keeping as a curiosity of ugliness in a
glass bottle, and I suppose they don't blow them large enough."</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! Mr. Sikes," said the Jew, trembling; "don't
speak so loud."</p>

<p>"None of your mistering," replied the ruffian; "you always
mean mischief when you come that. You know my name: out
with it. I shan't disgrace it when the time comes."</p>

<p>"Well, well, then, Bill Sikes," said the Jew with abject humility.
"You seem out of humour, Bill."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," replied Sikes. "I should think <em>you</em> were
rather out of sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you
throw pewter pots about, as you do when you blab and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" said the Jew, catching the man by the
sleeve, and pointing towards the boys.</p>

<p>Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot
under his left ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder;
a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand
perfectly. He then in cant terms, with which his whole
conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be
quite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass
of liquor.</p>

<p>"And mind you don't poison it," said Mr. Sikes, laying his
hat upon the table.</p>

<p>This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the
evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round
to the cupboard, he might have thought the caution not wholly
unnecessary, or the wish, at all events, to improve upon the distiller's
ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman's merry
heart.</p>

<p>After swallowing two or three glassfuls of spirits, Mr. Sikes
condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen;
which gracious act led to a conversation in which the cause and
manner of Oliver's capture were circumstantially detailed, with
such alterations and improvements on the truth as to the Dodger
appeared most advisable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said the Jew, "that he may say something
which will get us into trouble."</p>

<p>"That's very likely," returned Sikes with a malicious grin.
"You're blowed upon, Fagin."</p>

<p>"And I'm afraid, you see," added the Jew, speaking as if he
had not noticed the interruption, and regarding the other closely
as he did so,&mdash;"I'm afraid that, if the game was up with us, it
might be up with a good many more; and that it would come
out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear."</p>

<p>The man started, and turned fiercely round upon the Jew;
but the old gentleman's shoulders were shrugged up to his
ears, and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall.</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections, not excepting
the dog, who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed
to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman
or lady he might encounter in the street when he went out.</p>

<p>"Somebody must find out what's been done at the office,"
said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he
came in.</p>

<p>The Jew nodded assent.</p>

<p>"If he hasn't peached, and is committed, there's no fear till
he comes out again," said Mr. Sikes, "and then he must be
taken care on. You must get hold of him, somehow."</p>

<p>Again the Jew nodded.</p>

<p>The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but
unfortunately there was one very strong objection to its being
adopted; and this was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates,
and Fagin, and Mr. William Sikes, happened one and all to
entertain a most violent and deeply-rooted antipathy to going
near a police-office on any ground or pretext whatever.</p>

<p>How long they might have sat and looked at each other in
a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is
difficult to say. It is not necessary to make any guesses on
the subject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young
ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion caused the
conversation to flow afresh.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" said the Jew. "Bet will go; won't you,
my dear?"</p>

<p>"Wheres?" inquired the young lady.</p>

<p>"Only just up to the office, my dear," said the Jew coaxingly.</p>

<p>It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively
affirm that she would not, but that she merely expressed an
emphatic and earnest desire to be "jiggered" if she would; a
polite and delicate evasion of the request, which shows the
young lady to have been possessed of that natural good-breeding
that cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature the pain
of a direct and pointed refusal.</p>

<p>The Jew's countenance fell, and he turned to the other
young lady, who was gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a
red gown, green boots, and yellow curl-papers.</p>

<p>"Nancy, my dear," said the Jew in a soothing manner,
"what do <em>you</em> say?"</p>

<p>"That it won't do; so it's no use a trying it on, Fagin,"
replied Nancy.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" said Mr. Sikes, looking up in
a surly manner.</p>

<p>"What I say, Bill," replied the lady collectedly.</p>

<p>"Why, you're just the very person for it," reasoned Mr.
Sikes: "nobody about here, knows anything of you."</p>

<p>"And as I don't want 'em to, neither," replied Miss Nancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in the same composed manner, "it's rayther more no than
yes with me, Bill."</p>

<p>"She'll go, Fagin," said Sikes.</p>

<p>"No, she won't, Fagin," bawled Nancy.</p>

<p>"Yes she will, Fagin," said Sikes.</p>

<p>And Mr. Sikes was right. By dint of alternate threats, promises,
and bribes, the engaging female in question was ultimately
prevailed upon to undertake the commission. She was
not indeed withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable
friend, for, having very recently removed into the neighbourhood
of Field-lane from the remote but genteel suburb of
Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being
recognised by any of her numerous acquaintance.</p>

<p>Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over the red gown,
and the yellow curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,&mdash;both
articles of dress being provided from the Jew's inexhaustible
stock,&mdash;Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand.</p>

<p>"Stop a minute, my dear," said the Jew, producing a little
covered basket. "Carry that in one hand; it looks more respectable,
my dear."</p>

<p>"Give her a door-key to carry in her t'other one, Fagin,"
said Sikes; "it looks real and genivine like."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my dear, so it does," said the Jew, hanging a
large street-door key on the fore-finger of the young lady's right
hand. "There; very good,&mdash;very good indeed, my dear," said
the Jew, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, my brother! my poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!"
exclaimed Miss Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing
the little basket and the street-door key in an agony of distress.
"What has become of him!&mdash;where have they taken him to!
Oh, do have pity, and tell me what's been done with the dear
boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Having uttered these words in a most lamentable and heart-broken
tone, to the immeasurable delight of her hearers, Miss
Nancy paused, winked to the company, nodded smilingly round,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Ah! she's a clever girl, my dears," said the Jew, turning
to his young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in
mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had
just beheld.</p>

<p>"She's a honor to her sex," said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass,
and smiting the table with his enormous fist. "Here's her
health, and wishing they was all like her!"</p>

<p>While these and many other encomiums were being passed
on the accomplished Miss Nancy, that young lady made the
best of her way to the police-office; whither, notwithstanding a
little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the
streets alone and unprotected, she arrived in perfect safety
shortly afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key
at one of the cell-doors and listened. There was no sound
within, so she coughed and listened again. Still there was no
reply, so she spoke.</p>

<p>"Nolly, dear?" murmured Nancy in a gentle voice;&mdash;"Nolly?"</p>

<p>There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal,
who had been taken up for playing the flute, and who&mdash;the
offence against society having been clearly proved&mdash;had been
very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction
for one month, with the appropriate and amusing remark
that since he had got so much breath to spare, it would
be much more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in
a musical instrument. He made no answer, being occupied
in mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated
for the use of the county; so Miss Nancy passed on
to the next cell, and knocked there.</p>

<p>"Well," cried a faint and feeble voice.</p>

<p>"Is there a little boy here?" inquired Miss Nancy with a
preliminary sob.</p>

<p>"No," replied the voice; "God forbid!"</p>

<p>This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison
for <em>not</em> playing the flute, or, in other words, for begging in the
streets, and doing nothing for his livelihood. In the next
cell was another man, who was going to the same prison for
hawking tin saucepans without a licence, thereby doing something
for his living in defiance of the Stamp-office.</p>

<p>But as neither of these criminals answered to the name of
Oliver, or knew anything about him, Miss Nancy made straight
up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat, and with the
most piteous wailings and lamentations, rendered more piteous
by a prompt and efficient use of the street-door key and the
little basket, demanded her own dear brother.</p>

<p>"I haven't got him, my dear," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" screamed Miss Nancy in a distracted
manner.</p>

<p>"Why, the gentleman's got him," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"What gentleman? Oh, gracious heavins! what gentleman?"
exclaimed Miss Nancy.</p>

<p>In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed
the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill
in the office, and discharged in consequence of a witness having
proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy
not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away
in an insensible condition to his own residence, of and concerning
which all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere at
Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in the directions
to the coachman.</p>

<p>In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty the agonised
young woman staggered to the gate, and then,&mdash;exchanging her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
faltering gait for a good swift steady run, returned by the most
devious and complicated route she could think of, to the domicile
of the Jew.</p>

<p>Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition
delivered, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and,
putting on his hat, expeditiously departed, without devoting
any time to the formality of wishing the company good-morning.</p>

<p>"We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,"
said the Jew, greatly excited. "Charley, do nothing but skulk
about, till you bring home some news of him. Nancy, my dear,
I must have him found: I trust to you, my dear,&mdash;to you and
the Artful for every thing. Stay, stay," added the Jew, unlocking
a drawer with a shaking hand; "there's money, my
dears. I shall shut up this shop to-night: you'll know where
to find me. Don't stop here a minute,&mdash;not an instant, my
dears!"</p>

<p>With these words he pushed them from the room, and carefully
double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew
from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally
disclosed to Oliver, and hastily proceeded to dispose
the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing.</p>

<p>A rap at the door startled him in this occupation. "Who's
there?" he cried in a shrill tone of alarm.</p>

<p>"Me!" replied the voice of the Dodger through the keyhole.</p>

<p>"What now?" cried the Jew impatiently.</p>

<p>"Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?" inquired
the Dodger cautiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Jew, "wherever she lays hands on him.
Find him, find him out, that's all; and I shall know what to do
next, never fear."</p>

<p>The boy murmured a reply of intelligence, and hurried down
stairs after his companions.</p>

<p>"He has not peached so far," said the Jew as he pursued his
occupation. "If he means to blab us among his new friends,
we may stop his windpipe yet."</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h3>TO THE PUBLIC.</h3>


<p>In the prefatory observations I thought advisable to make when
placing "Love in the City" before the world, I stated that my chief
aim was the restoration of the drama to its pristine purity by avoiding
those unnatural and superhuman agencies which modern writers
have so extensively indulged in. Opposing myself thus, to innovation,
I have ventured on one of the boldest changes in dramatic
arrangement, by postponing the performance of the overture until the
commencement of the second act. Having thus admitted my offending,
I trust that, when the reasons which induced it are explained
and understood, I shall have justified this daring step, and obtained
a verdict of public acquittal.</p>

<p>Is there a frequenter of our theatres on a first night whose musical
sensibilities have not been lacerated by the noise and tumult incidental
to a crowded house? Let him achieve by desperate exertion a
favourable place in the undress circle,&mdash;suppose the theatre crammed
to the pigeon-holes, the orchestra already tuned, and every eye bent
upon the leader, awaiting his premonitory tap;&mdash;then, when the nervous
system should be quiescent, the ear open to receive delicious
sounds, the heart ready to expand itself into harmonious ecstacy,&mdash;at
that very moment of rapturous expectation has not his tranquillity
been annihilated by</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Some giggling daughter of the queen of love"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>pinching him in the ribs to acquaint him that he is "sitting on her
boa!" While, from that "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">refugium peccatorum</i>," the shilling gallery,
infernal cries of "Down in the front!" "Music!" "Curse your pedigree!"
"Hats off!" "How's your mother?" drown even the double-drums,
and render the overture inaudible from the opening crash to
the close.</p>

<p>To remedy this nuisance,&mdash;to allow the excited feelings of an overcrowded
house to subside sufficiently to enable the audience, by presenting
them with the first act, to judge how far the music of the
overture is adapted to the business of the stage,&mdash;these considerations
have induced me thus to postpone its performance, and with what
success the public will best decide.</p>

<p>Another, and a more agreeable duty, now devolves upon me,&mdash;to express
my ardent thanks to all and every to whom this drama is in any
way indebted for its brilliant and unparalleled success. To Messrs.
Flight and Robson; the commanding officers of the Foot and Fusileer
Guards; the King of the Two Sicilies; the Hereditary Prince of
Coolavin; and his serene highness the Duke of Darmstadt, I am
eternally grateful. To the performers, male and female, the composers,
the orchestra at large, scene-painters and scene-shifters,
prompters and property-men, box-keepers and check-takers, sentries
and police, I present my heartfelt acknowledgements. And to the
most crowded and fashionable audience that ever graced a metropolitan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
theatre, I shall only say, that the rapturous and reiterated
plaudits bestowed upon this drama shall never fade from the recollection
of their most devoted, very humble, too fortunate, and ever
grateful servant,</p>

<h3>CRITICAL REMARKS BY AN M.P.</h3>

<p>"I am not in the habit of frequenting the theatres, nor indeed
any public house, except the House of Commons; neither do I pretend
to be particularly conversant with the drama: but, by general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
consent, this play has been declared not inferior to the happiest
effort of the bard of Avon, as player-people call William Shakspeare.
I have not seen it represented; for, the free list being suspended,
prudence would not permit me to attend. Had half-price been taken,
I think I should have gone to the two-shilling gallery; but this question
is irrelevant.</p>

<p>"The author deserves well of his country. Indeed, his is a double
claim; and the debt consequently due by the public would amount
to a large <em>tottle</em>. No doubt the restoration of the drama is a matter
of some importance; but surely the diminution of drumsticks is one
of infinitely greater consideration!</p>

<p>"I perceive by the playbills,&mdash;one of which I was enabled to obtain
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratis</i>,&mdash;that a gentleman called Tambourette performs upon
two drums with a single stick. Now, I call the public attention to
this important discovery; and, in these times of retrenchment and
reform, the introduction of this system into our military establishment
should be at once insisted on. The saving would be immense.
Assuming that there are one hundred and three battalions of foot,
and, on an average, twelve drums to each regiment,&mdash;a shameful
waste of public money, by-the-bye, one drum and fife being quite
sufficient for each corps, as they only alarm an enemy in war-time,
and, in peace, destroy the utility of servant-maids by seducing them
eternally to the windows. Well, even permitting this extravagant
number to remain; by adopting Mr. Tambourette's system of performance,
one thousand two hundred and thirty-six drumsticks would
be saved to the country. Now, averaging the cost of the smaller-sized
drumstick at sixpence, and the larger at one shilling, a reduction
in the army estimates might be effected of <em>one thousand one hundred
and thirty-three small</em> and <em>one hundred and three large ones</em>;
making a <em>tottle</em> to the credit of the nation of 33<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>!!!</p>

<p>"If the author will furnish me with the necessary information to
enable me to frame a bill, I will move for a return of the drummers
attached at present to the army: specifying their respective names,
weights, heights, and ages, and take the earliest opportunity of bringing
the matter before parliament.</p>

<p class="author">"J.H.</p>
<p>"July 1, 1837.</p>

<p>"P.S. If one thousand two hundred and thirty-six drumsticks be
dispensed with, it follows that a similar number of drummers' hands
will then remain unoccupied. Might not a <em>one-handed fife</em> be introduced,
or a pandean pipe substituted, and fifers totally abolished?
I see no reason why the same man should not play the drum and
fife together. This, indeed, would be a reduction worthy a reformed
parliament, and a tremendous saving to the public purse.</p>

<span class="f60">OR</span>,<br />
<span class="f75">THE MAN IN THE SPANISH CLOAK.</span></h2>

<h3>A TALE OF "ST. LUKE'S."</h3>


<p>I had often met with him before in my travels, and had been
much struck with the peculiar acumen of his remarks whenever we
entered into conversation. His observations were witty, pungent, and
sarcastic; but replete with knowledge of men and things. He
seemed to despise book-knowledge of every kind, and argued that it
only tended to mislead. "I have good reason to be satisfied on this
point," he said to me one day at Vienna. "History is not to be relied
on; a fact is told a hundred different ways; the actions of men
are misrepresented, their motives more so; and as for travels, and
descriptions of countries, manners, customs, &amp;c. I have found out that
they are the most absurd things in the world,&mdash;mere fables and fairy
tales. Never waste your time on such trash!"</p>

<p>I again met this gentleman in Paris; it was at a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon d'écarté</i>;
and he amused me much by informing me of the names and circumstances
of the most distinguished persons present. Whether English,
French, or Germans, he knew something of the private history of
each, some ridiculous adventure or silly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre-tems</i>. I marvelled how
he could have collected so great a store, such as it was, of anecdote
and information; how he carried it all in remembrance; and, still
more, at the perfect <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</i> with which he detailed these things
under the very noses of the persons concerned, who would, had they
heard them, no doubt have made as many holes in his body with "penetrating
lead" as there are in a cullender.</p>

<p>To avoid getting into any scrape myself, I invited this <em>well-informed</em>
gentleman to spend an evening with me at my hotel, where, over
a bottle of claret, we might discuss some of those amusing matters,
more, at least, to my own ease. Before we separated, I pointed out a
certain Englishman to him, who was playing high, and did not notice
us: I asked him "If he knew anything respecting that gentleman?" I
had my private reasons for asking this question, unnecessary now to
mention, and was pleased to find my colloquial friend knew, as they say,
"all about him;" so we parted, with a promise on his side that on the
following evening he would visit me, and give me every particular.</p>

<p>He came punctually to appointment, but I could not prevail on him
to put off his large Spanish cloak, what they call technically "<em>an all-rounder</em>;"
he complained of cold, said he had been accustomed to a
<em>warm climate</em>, and sat down just opposite to me, when, without hesitation,
in a sort of business-like way, he entered at once into the details
I most wished to know respecting the young Englishman we had
left at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon d'écarté</i>; and left no doubt on my mind, from some
circumstances I already knew respecting him, that the account was
most veracious. I fell into a fit of musing in consequence of his narration,
which he did not interrupt by a single remark; but, fixing his
eyes upon me, seemed to be amusing himself with watching the progress
of my thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will never do!" said I, forgetting I was not alone; "he is not
worthy of her."</p>

<p>I stopped, and the stranger rose, gave me a peculiar significant
look, and was retiring, but I would not permit it; and, apologising
for my abstraction, insisted that he should finish the bottle with me:
so he sat down again, and we tried to converse as before, but it
would not do.</p>

<p>There we sat, facing each other, and both nearly silent; and now
it was that I remembered I had never once seen this stranger without
this same Spanish cloak,&mdash;a very handsome one it is true, richly
embroidered, and decorated with Genoese velvet, and a superb clasp
and chain of the purest gold and finest workmanship. I pondered on
this circumstance, as I recollected that even in Italy and the Ionian
islands, where I had before met him by some extraordinary chance,
as well as at Constantinople and at Athens, he had always been enveloped
in this same most magnificent mantle. At last I thought of
the fable of the man, the sun, and the wind; so concluded that he
wore this Spanish cloak to guard him equally from heat and cold, to
exclude the sun's rays and the winter's winds; or, perhaps, I argued,
he wears it to conceal the seedy appearance of his inner garments,
or sundry deficiencies of linen, &amp;c. "Things will wear out, and
linen will lose its snowy whiteness, but what the devil have I to do
with the matter? Let him wear his cloak, and sleep in it too, if it
please him; why should I trouble my head about it?"</p>

<p>"You are returning to England soon, sir," said, at length, the
cloaked stranger (but I am certain that I had not intimated such intention
to him); "I am proceeding there myself on some pressing
business, and will do myself the honour of there renewing our acquaintance."</p>

<p>I paused and hesitated ere I replied to this proposition. It is one
thing to invite an agreeable stranger to drink a bottle of claret with
you at an hotel in Paris, and another to bring him to the sanctuary of
your home, to the fireside of an Englishman, to the board of your ancestors,
to suffer him to gaze freely on the faces of your sisters, and to
pay his court at his ease to every other female relative beneath the
paternal roof!</p>

<p>The stranger saw my embarrassment, and seemed to penetrate the
cause. He gave me a smile of most inexplicable expression as he
said,</p>

<p>"Your late father, Sir George F&mdash;&mdash;, and myself, were old acquaintances.
We spent some months together at Rome, and met with a few
adventures there, which I dare say have never reached the ears of
his son."</p>

<p>This was said in his usual sarcastic way; but I could not endure
that he should allude in the slightest manner of disrespect to my deceased
father; so I answered, with much reserve, and some sign of
displeasure, "That I did not wish to pry into the youthful follies of so
near a relative; at the same time I thought it odd I never should have
heard my father mention that he had formed any particular intimacy
with any one at Rome, but, on the contrary, had even been given to
understand that all his recollections of the Eternal City were rather
of an <em>unpleasing</em> nature."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he never mention to you the baths of Caracalla?" demanded
my strange guest; "but it matters little, for the son of Sir George
F&mdash;&mdash; merits every attention from me <em>on his own account</em>, as well as
for the sake of <em>another</em>&mdash;&mdash;" He did not finish the sentence; but,
folding his cloak more closely round him, he made me a profound
bow, something between an Eastern salaam and the bow of a dancing-master,
and politely took his leave.</p>

<p>For two or three days I thought much of this extraordinary man;
but after that time I became so deeply interested in a Platonic <em>liaison</em>
with Madame de R&mdash;&mdash;, the beautiful wife of a Parisian banker, that
I forgot him altogether. I had to read, as well as to write, sentimental
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets-doux</i> sometimes twice a day, for so often they passed
between my fair Platonist and myself. I had to select all her books,
her flowers, and to choose her ribbons. I know not how it might
have ended, for affairs began to wear a very critical aspect; but I was
summoned to England by an express. My beloved mother was dangerously
ill. I tore myself away, disregardful of the tears that gathered
in the brightest pair of eyes in the world, and travelled post-haste
to Calais.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I put my foot on the deck of the vessel ere I perceived
my acquaintance of the Spanish cloak. There he was, walking
up and down the deck,&mdash;tall, erect, gentlemanly; there was
his magnificent cloak, without a wrinkle or a spot, the gloss still on
it. I sat still, and watched him, not without a sensation of annoyance,
as I was not at all in the humour just then to enter into
conversation. I was uneasy respecting the life of an only parent, and
I had just parted with one of the prettiest women in France, at the
moment, too, when we both wished Platonism in the same place its
founder was, dead and buried; but I might have saved myself the
trouble of being annoyed, for the stranger did not seem to recognise
me, nor wish to speak to any one. His carriage was lofty and
reserved; his eye was proud, and sought to <em>overlook</em> the rest of
the passengers as unworthy of its notice; and so marked was his
avoidance of myself, that I began to feel piqued, and to imagine that
my own personal appearance, if not our former knowledge of each
other, might have gained for me the honour of his notice. Never
before did I see so imperious an eye, or so magnificent a cloak!</p>

<p>The passage was a very boisterous one; and all the passengers,
both male and female, began to show evident signs enough that the
human animal was never intended by Nature to ride upon the ocean's
billows. Strange sounds were heard from the very depths of human
stomachs, as if in response to the roaring of the winds and the dashing
of the waves! I began to sympathise most sincerely with the
unhappy sufferers; for such sights and sounds are sure to affect the
feelings of those who both see and hear. In short, I began to look
grave, and become squeamish. I saw nothing but livid lips and
blue cheeks around me,&mdash;a perfect pandæmonium of wretchedness;
yet there walked the stately man in the cloak, perfectly unmoved
in countenance and stomach. I perceived he had lighted a cigar,
which glowed of a bright red colour, and threw a glow over his
handsome features.</p>

<p>I grew still worse, and my disorder was coming to its climax, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the eye of the stranger for the first time condescended to notice me,
and he bowed ceremoniously, with a smile which seemed to say, "I
wish you joy, young man, of your sea-sickness!" I turned from him,
and sincerely wished him in the same condition as myself and the
other victims of the wrath of Neptune. He advanced towards me.</p>

<p>"You look ill, sir!" he exclaimed. "Take the advice of an old
sailor; only try one of my cigars; <em>they are not of common use</em>;
one or two whiffs will drive away your nausea. I never knew them
fail."</p>

<p>Now I loathe smoking at all times; it is a vulgar and idle amusement,
fit only, as a modern writer says, for "the swell-mob;" but at
this moment the thought of it was execrable. I could have hurled
the stranger, when he offered me one of his cigars already ignited,
into the sea.</p>

<p>"I never smoke, sir," said I, pettishly, "and I always get as far
away as I can from those who do. May I thank you to go a little to
the windward?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, do not be obstinate," said the pertinacious stranger;
"we have many hours before we shall touch the shore, for you see
both wind and tide are against us. I assure you the remedy is always
efficacious;" and he handed me a lighted cigar, immediately under
my nose.</p>

<p>I snatched at the burning preparation, and flung it overboard, with
an exclamation of no gentle kind; it dropped into the boiling
waves, making a noise like a hissing red-hot iron, as it is put by
the smith into the water of the stone cistern.</p>

<p>"It is not of the slightest consequence," said my tormentor, affecting
to believe I had dropped the cigar by accident, "I have plenty
more in my case;" and with the most provoking coolness he lighted
another from his own, and presented it to me. I was puzzled what
to do, for the courtesy of this man was extreme. I was exceedingly
sick, and wished to get rid of him; for who likes to have a witness
during the time of Nature's distress? I therefore accepted his
cigar, and turned from him, with a very equivocal bow of acknowledgement.</p>

<p>There was something of a very refreshing nature in the smell of
this extraordinary-looking cigar, which was burning steadily in my
hand. I resolved to try its boasted efficacy; and accordingly put it
to my lips, and inhaled its fragrance. In a moment I was well, more
than well; for a delicious languor seized me. After that, my nerves
were braced, invigorated; I felt as a hunter does after a long day's
sport, hungry almost to famine, and I descended to the saloon, and
called lustily to the steward to bring me a cold fowl, a plate of
ham, and a bottle of porter. No more nausea, no more livid lips
and blue cheeks. All of a sudden I became eloquent, poetical, and
brimful of the tender passion. I wished to console some of my fair
companions who were languishing around me, and offered my cigar
to all who would accept it. Had it not been for an occasional thought
of my mother's illness, which would intrude upon me whether I wished
it or not, what folly and entanglement might I have got into with a
pretty milliner on board, just returned from Paris, with fashions in
her head, and French levity in her heart!</p>

<p>I ought to have acknowledged my obligation to the stranger for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
remedy; but I had conceived so insuperable a dislike to him, that I
could not account for it, and my only wish was to escape from his
society at Dover, as I feared he would offer to accompany me to
London, and I could hardly refuse him after the service he had rendered
me. I therefore lingered below some few minutes when we
arrived, and looked cautiously around me when I ascended the companion-ladder;
but the stranger was gone. I saw no trace of his
august person then, or his superb Spanish cloak.</p>

<p>I hastened on with four horses to &mdash;&mdash; Square, and met my weeping
sisters. My mother still breathed; but that was all. The
physicians could not comprehend her malady, but agreed to call
it a general debility, an exhaustion of the vital energies, without any
particular complaint. She was extremely weak, but knew me instantly,
and smiled her welcome as I knelt and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>My mother was only of the middle age, which made it more
strange that physical weakness should thus overpower her. I inquired
at what time she was first seized; and on reference to my note-book,
found out that her first appearance of illness was at the <em>precise
hour</em> when the stranger in the Spanish cloak was sitting with me at
my hotel, and talking to me of my father. Well! what of that? it
was a mere chance!</p>

<p>It is no use disguising it. I am naturally superstitious. We can
no more help the frailties of our minds than the blemishes of our features.
As I sat by my declining mother's side, I pondered again and
again on this mysterious stranger. I recollected how he had cured
me of my sickness in a moment; how wonderfully he knew the private
history of every individual; and I ended by believing that there
was something of a supernatural agency about him. "Perhaps,"
thought I, starting up suddenly, and speaking aloud, "perhaps this
wonderful cigar of his might recover my beloved mother." I searched
every pocket, hoping that a remnant of it might have remained:
but, no; it had been whiffed away by the ladies in the cabin, and I
had not a vestige left.</p>

<p>When once an idea seizes hold on the mind, it scarcely ever lets go
its hold. I began to consider myself mad, yet could not prevent myself
from going out I knew not whither, to make inquiries for the
cloaked stranger, and request him to give me another of his marvellous
cigars. As I passed Louisa and Emily, my sisters, and&mdash;&mdash;,
now no more, they were alarmed by the wildness of my looks, and
endeavoured to arrest my progress.</p>

<p>"I go to seek a remedy for my mother," exclaimed I, breaking
from them, and I darted from the house.</p>

<p>I made inquiries at all the principal hotels and club-houses for the
stranger in the magnificent cloak. The waiters at the Oriental, the
Travellers, and the Albion, had all seen him, but knew not his address
or name. I sought him in the parks, at the exhibitions; but
could not find him. At length I thought of the British Museum, but
<em>why</em> I did so appears to me most mysterious; I drove instantly thither,
and ran through all the rooms with the most searching gaze. In
George the Fourth's splendid library there, seated at his ease by special
permission from Sir Henry Ellis, I beheld the man I sought,
with a large folio volume of Eastern learning spread open before
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt ashamed to address him; for, had I not been most uncourteous,
most repulsive to him? and now I wanted another favour. I
stood before the table at which he sat, and watched his countenance
as he seemed engrossed with his Oriental literature; but it was only
for a moment, for he raised his eyes by some sudden impulse, and
fixed them straight upon me.</p>

<p>The stranger acknowledged me not even by a bow or a look of
recognition. I knew not what to say to him, yet the case was urgent.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir," I stammered out, "I fear I interrupt you;
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Proceed, sir," said the stranger, coldly. "I am always ready to
listen to the son of Sir George F&mdash;&mdash;, for I owe to the father some
obligation."</p>

<p>"You possess the power of allaying the most tormenting sickness
by some mysterious drug or preparation," I said, hesitating as I spoke:
"that was no common cigar. Have you other remedies?"</p>

<p>"A thousand," replied the stranger. "Pray go on."</p>

<p>"My mother lies dangerously ill; can you restore her?"</p>

<p>"May I behold the patient?" demanded the stranger, and an inexpressible
glance flashed from his brilliant eyes.</p>

<p>What made me tremble at this natural request? for such it might
have been deemed, since every medical man has free liberty to inquire
into the symptoms of the case before he prescribes.</p>

<p>Fixedly did his eyes rest on mine; they seemed as if turned to
stone, for they moved not in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>"I will <em>describe</em> my mother's case to you, sir," I said, evasively.</p>

<p>He made me no answer; but, casting down his eyes, he calmly
resumed his reading, and I walked up and down the spacious apartment,
in which there were not above a dozen other persons, in a state
of mind resembling a chaos, occasionally glancing with angry eyes at
the reading stranger, who seemed perfectly composed, and unconscious
of my presence.</p>

<p>"What a fool am I!" said I, mentally; "what <em>harm</em> can this man
do my dying mother? but, then, <em>she</em> may see him&mdash;this being that
resembles a demi-god&mdash;and <em>she</em> too of so peculiar a mind, so enamoured
of all that is great and wonderful; so romantic, too! Wretch
that I am! is my beloved mother's life to be sacrificed&mdash;at least
the chance of saving her&mdash;to a wild and jealous fantasy? No!" and I
walked up again to the table.</p>

<p>The stranger was rising as I approached him, had closed his book,
and returned it to the librarian. He would have passed me, but I
laid my hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Most extraordinary being!" said I, "<em>come</em>, I conjure you, and
save my mother!"</p>

<p>He entered my carriage without saying a word, and silently followed
me to the apartment of my languishing parent, who was dozing
in a sort of lethargic stupor, that appeared to be the precursor of
death. My two sisters stood gazing on her pale features, and&mdash;&mdash;
was holding her thin white hand in one of hers, and bathing it with
her tears.</p>

<p>The stranger took my mother's hand from hers, and&mdash;I cannot be
mistaken, for I watched every movement&mdash;some strong agitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
some convulsive spasm, passed over his countenance as he looked
upon that face which never had its equal yet on earth; but, whatever
was his emotion, he soon mastered it, and desired that a silver plate
and lamp might be brought to him.</p>

<p>From a small crystal box the stranger took out a brown preparation,
and, breaking it in two, placed them on the silver plate; then
with a slip of paper lighted from the lamp he ignited the substance so
placed, which sent up a pale blue flame, and a most intoxicating
odour. He desired that my mother should be raised in bed, even to
a sitting posture, when he placed the blazing plate immediately beneath
her nostrils, and some portion of the actual flame entered and curled
about her face. My sisters shrieked, but &mdash;&mdash; spake not a word, and
I waited the result with agonised impatience.</p>

<p>"She revives! she revives!" exclaimed the latter, "and my blessed
aunt will live!"</p>

<p>It was true. Years have gone by, and <em>my mother is still alive</em>.
Never has she had an hour's illness from that hour. Was I grateful
to the stranger for saving a life so prized? No. In my heart I
loathed him at the very time he was heaping benefits upon me. And
why? I detected a look of wonder, and admiration, and gratitude,
and a smile of ineffable beauty directed towards him by one who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Disguising as well as I was able the hatred that swelled within my
heart, I offered to place on the finger of this mysterious visitant a ring
of great value, that belonged once to my father. He started as
he saw it, and, pressing a secret spring in it that I knew not of, restored
it to me.</p>

<p>"It was a present from myself to him at Rome," he said, and his
voice faltered, "for a signal benefit conferred. Behold! there is my
own miniature!"</p>

<p>And it was so. Most exquisitely painted was there concealed, a
minute resemblance of himself. I now perceived, and I cursed him
in my heart for it, that &mdash;&mdash; retained the ring, after having expressed
her astonishment at the fidelity of the likeness. I rudely snatched
it from her hand, and threw the ring from me.</p>

<p>"Theodore," said my mother, "give me that ring. I know full
well who it was presented that ring to him who is now no more.
Marquis! I must speak to you alone, but not now. Come hither to-morrow.
Now, I beseech you, retire!"</p>

<p>How dreadful is it to bear about with us the seeds of insanity. I
have felt them shoot and grow within me from my childhood. The
fibres had twined about my very being. <em>I knew</em> that madness must
some time or other scorch my brain; I was full of delusions; I could
behold nothing clear with my mental vision. I once heard a learned
physician say to my father, "Take care of him, sir. Excitement
may drive that boy mad. Do not let him study too much; and, above
all, I trust he will never meet with disappointment in any affair of
the heart."</p>

<p>Have I met with such? Let me not think about it, or&mdash;&mdash;<em>And yet
I am not mad now.</em></p>

<p>From this time I became gloomy and morose, and always worse
whenever this accursed man in the Spanish cloak came to the house,
which now was very often. He charmed all but myself. I hated
the sound of his voice. My sisters would come and try to soothe me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
into sociability and calmness. I repelled them with harshness and
severity; and even when my gentle cousin tried each soft persuasive
art to lead me to his presence, I taunted her in the cruellest manner
with her hypocrisy, as I chose to call her blandishments, and bade her
"go to the fascinating marquis, and heap her witcheries on him."
Nothing could exceed the patience of this devoted being, her sweetness
of temper, her angelic forbearance, but my own ferocity and
hellish brutality; yet how did I love her, even when I bitterly reviled
her! Once, when I observed that ring upon her finger, which
my mother had permitted her to wear,&mdash;that ring, bearing the portrait
of <em>that man</em>,&mdash;I absolutely spurned her from my presence, and
wonder now that I did not murder her.</p>

<p>Cloud after cloud obscured the light of reason in my brain, and it
was deemed advisable by those who loved me still, notwithstanding
my growing malady, to have some one with me night and day, lest I
should lay violent hands upon myself, as if a life like mine were worth
the caring for.</p>

<p>An intelligent young man, one of my tenants, accepted this painful
task, and he performed it with gentleness and fidelity. He soon
perceived that I grew more furious when the voice or the name
of the Marquis &mdash;&mdash; met my ears. He mentioned this circumstance
to my mother, and from that time the marquis was not permitted to
enter the house. I heard of this at first with incredulity, then with
complacency. By degrees I grew calmer. I was afterwards shown
a letter from the cloaked stranger, dated Rome; and it confirmed
their assertions. I once more enjoyed the society of my family, and
basked in the smiles of my beloved cousin. She was all kindness, all
attention; and I began to flatter myself that the ardent love I had
borne her from my very boyhood was returned. It was her reserve
that before drove me from my country.</p>

<p>To my great astonishment and delight, that young Englishman who
had interested me so much in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon d'écarté</i> at Paris, was formally
refused by her who was dearer to me than life. He was of ancient
family, and of great possessions; I knew he loved her, and feared
he would gain her: but on my saying one day, as if by accident, in
her presence, "that I feared S&mdash;&mdash; gamed high, and consequently
was not worthy of the regard of any woman of discretion," she gave
me a smile of ineffable sweetness, and told me, "It was of little consequence
to her his frailties or his virtues; for she had long determined
to give him a refusal, and, in fact, had done so before he went
to Paris."</p>

<p>I considered the <em>manner</em> of my cousin, more than her mere words,
as encouragement to myself, and with all the ardour of my nature
declared to her my passion. These were her words in reply: "Theodore,
I pretend not to misunderstand you; and, if it be any comfort
to you, believe that I most tenderly return your affection. But, oh,
my beloved cousin! think how you have been afflicted,&mdash;and then ask
yourself whether I ought to listen to your proposals? whether you
ought to marry? Theodore, I solemnly promise you that, for your
sake, never will I wed another; but, oh! ask me not to become your
wife whilst you are subject to such a fearful malady."</p>

<p>In vain I represented to her that my late mental affliction had been
caused wholly by my fear of losing her, as I believed that detested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
foreigner was exactly the man to charm her, and thus I considered
her lost to me for ever.</p>

<p>"This, dear Theodore," she answered, "is one of your delusions.
You had no cause why you should form such a preposterous notion,&mdash;a
man old enough to be my father, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is true," said I, "there is disparity of years; but, then, what
a splendid being!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied coldly, "he wears a most magnificent cloak."</p>

<p>"Not always, sure?" I asked inquiringly, for I had never entered
the room where he was, since he had cured my mother. "Did he
not remove it when he dined and drank tea with you so often, and
stayed so late, that I could have torn him to pieces for it?"</p>

<p>"Softly, my beloved cousin," said the sweet girl, placing her soft
hand before my lips; "why are you so excited now when talking of
this stranger? <em>Your</em> mother, Theodore, has been restored by him;
and for that service what do we not all owe him?"</p>

<p>"Was it for this," I said, "from gratitude alone, you wore that
ring?"</p>

<p>"Yes, from gratitude only. Are you now satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Blessings on you, dearest, for your kindness!" I continued. "But
say, did you ever see him without that cloak?"</p>

<p>"Never, Theodore, never. It was always too hot or too cold; or he
was poorly, or some excuse or other. We never could persuade him
to take off that cloak."</p>

<p>I fell into a long reverie after this; nor could I blame her for her
decision. I knew myself that my brain was not steady, and consequently
I had no right to marry, to entail on my innocent offspring
such a calamity. But then this inexplicable stranger;&mdash;perhaps he
had the power to cure me,&mdash;he had already performed almost a miracle;
if he could but settle my head, my beloved cousin would become
mine, and I should be free from those fears that were constantly
besetting me of becoming incurably mad.</p>

<p>Nothing would now do but my immediately setting out for Rome
to seek the stranger with the large Spanish cloak. My mother did
not think it advisable that I should go alone; so it was determined
that she, with Louisa and Emily, accompanied by our sweet relative,
should bear me company to Italy, and thither we accordingly went.
We lingered not on our progress to look at curiosities, or paintings,
or prospects. We journeyed as fast as four horses could carry us, and
arrived quite safe at imperial Rome.</p>

<p>I was sorry to learn that the Marquis &mdash;&mdash; was now at Naples;
and, after settling my family in an elegant villa a few miles from modern
Rome, I set off in quest of the man for whom I had an antipathy,
powerful, incurable; and for what purpose? To request his aid,
mysterious, perhaps sinful, to cure me of a disorder, of which the consciousness
was part of its calamity. The raving madman, at least, is
saved from <em>knowing</em> his own misery.</p>

<p>I had not been an hour at Naples, attended by my favourite servant,
the young man who once acted to me as my keeper, when I saw
from the window of my hotel the cloaked stranger pass with a lady on
his arm. But I hesitated not,&mdash;I might lose him for ever; so I ran into
the street, and hastily accosted him.</p>

<p>What I said to him I know not, for my words were wild and ambiguous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
but he promised that he would dine with me the following
day, although his manners were even more reserved than when I
spoke to him at the Museum.</p>

<p>Our instincts ought ever to be attended to; the brute creation follow
nothing else, and <em>they</em> commit no sin. The first time I saw this
stranger, he was looking at an inscription at Athens, and I felt a
secret desire to get from his presence; but he entangled me with his
talk, his knowledge of everything around, his high bearing, his intelligent
eyes, and his superb Spanish cloak.</p>

<p>Again we were seated at the same table, and I again requested
him to remove his mantle.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he said significantly; "but after the cloth is removed
I will, if you still wish it, take off this upper clothing."</p>

<p>Oh how sarcastically were these words pronounced! My heart
beat violently; I could not eat, and became abstracted and melancholy;
not a word was said respecting my request to him, nor did he
ask me why I sought him. He ate in silence, and seemed to have
forgotten he was not alone.</p>

<p>When the table was cleared, the stranger coolly took a book from
under his cloak, and began to read; whilst I, pondering on all I had
ever known of him, began to feel the most burning desire to see this
man once <em>without</em> his cloak, and was determined to do my utmost
to effect it.</p>

<p>"The cloth <em>is</em> now removed, signor," said I, "and you promised
<em>then</em> you would take off that everlasting garment."</p>

<p>"It displeases you, then?" retorted my companion. "<em>Is it not
unsafe to penetrate below the exterior of all things?</em> Is not the surface
ever the most safe? Is not the <em>outer</em> clothing of nature ever the
most beautiful to the eye? What deformity dwells in mines, in caverns,
at the bottom of the ocean! Nature wears a cloak as beautiful
as mine: do you wish also to strip off her covering as well as mine?"</p>

<p>"At this moment, signor," said I gloomily, "I was not thinking
of Nature at all, but of the strangeness of your ever wearing that
cloak."</p>

<p>"Was it for this you came from England, Sir Theodore?" inquired
the marquis, "and sought me at Naples? The knowledge, I should
deem, could never compensate you for the loss of your cousin's society
so many days."</p>

<p>"It was not for this I sought you, noble marquis," I replied, piqued
at his irony; "but, when a man ever wears a cloak, it must be for
some purpose."</p>

<p>"Granted," slowly said my companion; "I have such purpose."</p>

<p>"Which you promised to unfold!" I exclaimed, with pertinacity.
"Is it still your pleasure so to do?"</p>

<p>"<em>It is necessary first that we should have no intruders</em>," he answered,
with a tone that froze me to the heart. Oh, how cutting,
how sarcastic did it sound in my ears!</p>

<p>"No person will enter this apartment save my faithful servant,
Hubert; therefore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I promised to enlighten the master, and not the servant. If you
insist on this strange request, the door must be securely locked;
there must be no chance of interruption."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a fuss," I thought, "about a mantle! Why, <em>he</em> must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
be mad too! How can he cure me of an evil he has himself? Lock
the door, forsooth, because he takes off his cloak! But I must humour
him, I suppose, or he will find an excuse for breach of promise."
As I thought this, I walked to the door, locked it, and, placing
the key upon the table, merely said, "Now, signor, your promise?"</p>

<p>"Would it not be prudent, young gentleman," he observed, laying
his finger on my sleeve, "that you should speak of your request,&mdash;that
one that brought you hither, and which I should conceive of
more importance than the satisfying an idle curiosity,&mdash;would it not
be wiser of you to mention this previously to my taking off my cloak."</p>

<p>"Oh, what importance he attaches to so trifling a thing!" thought
I; "but, after all, the man is right; I had better attend to the most
essential, nor was I wise to couple two requests together."</p>

<p>"Signor Marquis," said I, "have you any cure for insanity?"</p>

<p>"<em>I cured your father</em>," was the answer, "and this your mother
knows. He in return did <em>me</em> a service; he presented me with&mdash;this
excellent cloak."</p>

<p>I was more puzzled than ever; I had never before <em>heard</em> that my
poor father had unsettled reason, but many circumstances made me
now believe it. I fancied too that my youngest sister gave indications
of the same disorder; she was growing melancholy and reserved.
"Oh, heavens!" thought I, "there will be more work for
this man to do; I had better invite him at once to England, and make
him physician in ordinary to our family."</p>

<p>"I have an engagement at nine," said the stranger; "have you
any other inquiries to make?"</p>

<p>"But, if you <em>cured</em> my father, Signor Marquis," I observed, "how
is it that I have inherited the disease? Should not the <em>cure</em> have
eradicated it for ever from him and his posterity?"</p>

<p>"Is it not enough that I prevented the display of such a malady
during his life? that I drove away the cloud that obscured his
day, so that the sun of reason shone brightly on him until his death?
What had I to do with future generations? with a race of men then
unborn? <em>I performed my contract</em>, and he was satisfied. Shall the
son be more difficult to please than the father?"</p>

<p>I interrupted him, "Oh, mysterious man! canst thou not cure the
<em>root</em> of this disease? stop its fatal progress? prevent the seed from
partaking of the nature of the plant?"</p>

<p>"Young man!" solemnly returned the marquis, "was not thy first
progenitor, the man who resided in Paradise, <em>mad</em>&mdash;essentially mad?
and has not his disease been carried on, in spite of all physicians, down,
down to the present hour? It is woven into man's very nature; the
warp and woof of which he is composed. I can check its open
manifestation in a single individual; but the evil will only be dammed
up during his time, to give it an increased impetus and power to those
who follow him. Art thou not an instance of this fact? Hast thou
not been madder than thy father?"</p>

<p>I groaned aloud. I remembered my own wild delusions, my sudden
bursts of passion. I even began to think that madness ruled me
at that very hour; that all I saw and heard was the coinage of a distempered
brain.</p>

<p>At length I said, dejectedly, unknowing that I spoke aloud, "Then
I must never marry; my children will become worse than myself.
Farewell then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or rather," interrupted the cloaked stranger, "farewell to human
marriages altogether, if those who marry must be free from madness.
Why, 'tis the very sign they are so, their wishing to rivet fetters
on themselves; but, no matter. What have I to do with all the
freaks and frenzied institutions of such a set of driveling idiots?"</p>

<p>"Art thou not a man?"</p>

<p>"Thou shalt judge for thyself, thou insect of an hour!" and he
unclasped his cloak, and stood erect before me. Coiled around him
like a large boa-constrictor, reaching to his very throat,&mdash;&mdash;But
I sicken as I write! The remembrance of that moment, how shall it
be effaced? Time deadens thousands of recollections, but has never
weakened the impression made upon me at that appalling moment!</p>

<p>The immense mass that wound its lengthy fibres round him, like a
cable of a ship, now became sensibly animated by life! I beheld it
move, and writhe, and unfold itself! I heard its extremity drop
upon the floor! I saw it extend itself, and creep along! More&mdash;more
still descended; fewer coils were round him! He turned himself
to facilitate its descent; and, when the enormous whole encircled
him, still undulating on the ground, that being looked towards me with
one of those smiles, that Satan might be supposed to use.</p>

<p>"Behold!" said he, pointing to the dark undulation on the floor,
"<em>behold the reason why I wear a cloak!</em>"</p>

<p>Insensibility closed up my senses. I could behold no more. When
I recovered, I was alone. The stranger had departed, leaving the
door ajar; but he had written on a slip of paper, and placed it
just before me, these words:</p>

<p>"The remedy I bestowed upon the father, for <em>his</em> sake I will
give unto the son. <em>Three notches of the devil's tail</em> will perfectly restore
you; but it must be cut off by the hand of <em>the purest person
that you know on earth</em>. <em>It will grow again!!</em>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I hastily caught up this paper on hearing the step of my attendant,
and placed it in my bosom. I think he saw the action, for
he looked mournfully on me, and shook his head. I told him I was
ready to set off instantly for Rome: his simple answer was,</p>

<p>"I wish we had remained there!"</p>

<p>"And <em>why</em>, Hubert?"</p>

<p>"You are pale as a sheeted corpse, and the boards of the floor
are <em>singed</em>, yet there has been no fire in the room!"</p>

<p>I looked where he pointed; and, in a serpentine form, I beheld
the traces of that enormous tail I had seen fall from the body of the
cloaked stranger, coiled round him as an immense serpent twines itself
around a tree. I shuddered at the sight. I felt my brain working;
yet I wrestled with the spirit of darkness within. I tried to
persuade myself that I had been overtaken only by a dream; that
my whole acquaintance with the pretended marquis was nothing
but an illusion, a vision of the imagination, an optic delusion, an hallucination
of an excited state of mind; but it would not do. There
were the dark and calcined marks, which it was my duty to account
for to my host, who cared very little how they were occasioned, so
as he received an ample sum to have the boards removed, and others
in their place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Our accounts were soon arranged, and I returned to my anxious
family; but my disorder was increasing hourly. The wildest imaginations
haunted and perplexed me. My beloved mother looked at
me with tears swimming in her eyes. My eldest sister strove, by
a hundred stratagems, to dispel the gloom that arose amongst us
all. Emily sat, absorbed in her own melancholy thoughts, a fellow-sufferer,
I fancied, with myself. My lovely, innocent, affectionate
cousin held my fevered hand in one of hers, and imploringly asked
me to be tranquil; said she would sing to me if I would try to sleep.
I felt the gentle charm, and gave myself up to it. I laid myself upon
the sofa; and she, whose name I cannot utter, sitting on a low stool
by my side, sought to soothe me with her voice.</p>

<div class="verse vi2">Calm the fever of his mind;</div>
<div class="verse">All thy healing virtues shed,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>"Oh, God!" I cried, jumping up; "and must I never call this
angel mine? Better to die at once, or lose all consciousness of what
a wretch I am!"</p>

<p>"Hush, my dearest cousin! I have invoked an angel from the
skies to visit you; drive her not away by ill-timed violence; here, let
me hold your hand;" and she began again to murmur in a low tone,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Strew thy poppies o'er his head,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Calm the fever of his mind."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and so I fell asleep.</p>

<p>When I awoke, my gentle cousin, (more constant than my heavenly
visitant, Sleep,) was still seated by my side; all the rest were gone;
candles burned on the table&mdash;it was midnight; I had slept for hours,
she yet retained my hand. I looked at her, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"We are alone, Theodore," said my beloved; "tell me, I beseech
you, what is labouring on your mind. You have spoken strange
things during your sleep. You have declared that I had the power
to restore you; can I do this? Theodore, be candid! Were it to
cost my life, I would gladly lay it down to be of benefit to you."</p>

<p>I could not answer her; but I clasped my arms round that pure,
angelic form, and wept like an infant on her bosom.</p>

<p>"Can I do you service, Theodore? You deny not what your
lips murmured in sleep."</p>

<p>"You can restore my reason, for you are the purest person that I
know on earth."</p>

<p>"By what means? But, alas! you are wandering still; this is
one of your delusions! Would that it were in my power to heal thy
mind, my dearest cousin."</p>

<p>"In this, my heart's treasure, I am at least perfectly sane. <em>You
have the power to cure me.</em>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me the means."</p>

<p>I related to &mdash;&mdash; the whole of my adventures at Naples. I hid
nothing from her excepting that our children might be infected with
the same disease. Many reasons prevented my naming this. She
was too delicate for me to allude to such a circumstance; I was willing
to run all hazards of my posterity inheriting so dreadful a disease.
My father had done as I intended to do; and the remedy was as
open to <em>my</em> offspring as to myself, for had not the cloaked stranger
told me that "the tail would grow again"? Even without such
growth, had it not notches enough for a whole line of my posterity,
supposing them all in want of such a restorative.</p>

<p>There was a pause of a full minute ere she spoke; her cheek was
blanched, and her hand trembled in mine.</p>

<p>"Theodore, I know not what to think, whether from madness or
from sanity comes your wondrous tale; but I will go through it,
come what may. I will see this being; and, should he be indeed the
author of all evil, out of evil shall come good, for I have courage, for
your dear sake, to take from him the horrid remedy; but speak not
of it, even to your mother or your sisters. Ah, poor Emily! she too
may need such help! I will procure enough for her also."</p>

<p>Every thing was arranged. I was in that state that all I demanded
was granted to me, for they feared to oppose my wishes. I entered
the travelling carriage with my beautiful betrothed.</p>

<p>We had no attendants. We drove to the same hotel in which
I had been before. We were shown into the same room; but the
marks upon the floor were gone,&mdash;new boards were there. We
ordered dinner <em>for three</em>; and I went out in search of the cloaked
stranger.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that those who seek the devil, should seek in
vain; but what is so perverse as the Origin of Evil?</p>

<p>Towards the close of day I however brought him in, as lofty, proud-looking,
and handsome as ever; his features bore the stamp of angelic
beauty; but, alas! the expression was&mdash;<em>the fallen angel</em>. He
saluted with much politeness, nay, even kindness, my lovely friend;
and we entered at once upon the business.</p>

<p>When he heard <em>who</em> was to perform the operation, he absolutely
turned pale, and made a thousand objections. Some other person
might be found; but I, fool that I was! overruled them all, and insisted
on it, that she was the purest person that I knew on earth.</p>

<p>He then endeavoured to intimidate her; but she was resolute,
though her lip quivered. We had a long argument about it, and
most subtle was his reasoning. Yet he seemed as if he had no power
absolutely to refuse. Reluctantly he drew from a secret pocket in
his cloak a small steel hatchet, with many figures inscribed upon it.
She received it at his hands; but I observed a fixedness in her
beautiful eyes, and a rigidity about her mouth, that I did not like;
still she grasped the shining instrument, and hesitated not. But,
when his cloak fell off, oh, what a look of horror did those dear eyes
assume!</p>

<p>Slowly descended the voluminous appendage; its extreme end fell
on the chair on which he had been sitting. She flew like lightning
thither, raised the glittering tool, marked the precise spot, and severed
at a blow "three notches of the devil's tail!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take&mdash;take your remedy, dear Theodore!" she whispered, "for
I cannot touch it."</p>

<p>I stooped, and took the severed quivering part, <em>but could not hold it
for its heat</em>; so thrust it into my coat-pock; I then turned to congratulate
my deliverer, <em>but she was a lifeless corpse at my feet</em>; and the
stranger had vanished, I knew not and I cared not whither.</p>

<p>How often have I called on madness, or on death, to take from me
the memory of her loss! Neither would come! I have had no
return of my malady, but I have experienced anguish fourfold! The
only benefit derived has been that my sister Emily has been totally
cured by the specific that was so dearly purchased, for it proved efficacious
in both cases.</p>

<p>Perchance it may prove useful for the future members of our family,
should they be infected with this hereditary complaint; for
myself, I shall never need it for my offspring, my affections are
buried in the grave; but I have bequeathed it to my beloved sisters&mdash;with
my hopes, more than my belief, that it may prove effective,&mdash;"the
<em>three notches of the devil's tail</em>!"</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="THE_PORTRAIT_GALLERY_No_III" id="THE_PORTRAIT_GALLERY_No_III"></a>THE PORTRAIT GALLERY.&mdash;No. III.</h2>


<p>My friend was proceeding to relate many curious anecdotes of <span class="smcap">Sir
Ruby Ratborough</span>, when a row of several portraits of persons I had
seen abroad struck me. The librarian informed me that they were
those of the Cannon family, who had long resided on the Continent;
and I immediately recognised a most eccentric set of people, met
so often, and at various places, with such a rapidity of locomotion,
that many fancied they were gifted with ubiquity. The portraits,
my conductor informed me, were taken at Florence; and their history
might serve as a hint to artists. The painter had, unfortunately,
commenced with the handsomest of the girls; and, having somewhat
flattered the likeness, of course the family were delighted with his
performance: but, when the older and the uglier Cannons came to sit,
no flattery could render their portraits tolerable to them. The consequence
was, that they were considered as bad resemblances, and left on
the painter's hand; the more favoured young ones, of course, not
being allowed by their indignant elders to take theirs away. I had
heard so much of this family that I requested my friend to postpone
our review of the political character, to give me some account of
these wandering emigrants; and he gratified my curiosity by putting
into my hands the following MS. containing a sketch of their adventures
at home and abroad, drawn out by Quintilian Quaint.</p>


<h3>THE CANNON FAMILY.</h3>

<p>Who has not seen the Cannons in their Continental excursions?
or, to use Mrs. Cannon's malapropic expression, their <em>incontinental</em>
tours? Whoever has strolled, or lounged, or lurked in a French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promenade</i>, a Spanish <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">alameda</i>, or an Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">corso</i>, has fallen upon
some branch of the family; nay, more properly, on two or three
of them; for, if a body perchance hits upon one individual of that
numerous race, he is sure to be rebounded on a brother or a sister,
illustrating their name by making what is called a <em>canon</em> in billiard-room
parlance.</p>

<p>So very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répandu</i> is this moving train of curious ordnance, and
the young ladies have been so walked about, and stalked about, and
dragged about in pick-nicks, <em>déjeuners champêtres</em>, gipsy-parties, marooning-parties,
through woods and forests, hills and dales, brushwood
and underwood, that the witty Lady A&mdash;&mdash; called them <em>the field-pieces</em>.</p>

<p>What took this family from their delightful box at Muckford, in
Shropshire, to visit France, and Italy, and Germany; to paddle in
the Seine, dabble in the Arno, and stroll with the rabble along the
Rhine? Surely it must have been love of the fine arts, or the cultivation
of foreign tongues, with the ladies; or pursuits of political
economy, statistics, or the study of men and manners, with the gentlemen.
Not in the least degree. The only paintings the fair part of
the family admired were their own lovely faces. All foreign tongues
were as foreign to them as Sanscrit. The only pursuit of polity that
occupied Messrs. Cannons', senior and juniors, was where to find cheap
wines and parsimonious amusements; their statistics, a census of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
geese and turkeys, turbots and mullets, brought to market; and their
study of the "varying shore o' the world" was, congregating with
their countrymen, who, like themselves, disported their nonentity in
gambling-houses and <em>restaurans</em>.</p>

<p>What was it then that induced the Cannons to quit their delightful
box in Shropshire? Simply because Lord Wittington and his family
had purchased the estate of Myrtle-Grove, near unto Wick-Hall,&mdash;the
name given by Mr. Cannon to his aforesaid delightful box.
Now the motives that induced Mr. Commodus Cannon to bestow
upon this box the euphonious appellation of <em>Wick-Hall</em>, arose from a
natural association of ideas and a proper sense of gratitude; for, be
it known, that Mr. Commodus Cannon had once been a tallow-chandler
of great renown in the ward of Candlewick, in which business
he had realised a large fortune; therefore, without much perplexity
of the various ramifications of the brain, its circumvolutions
and ventricles, it may be conjectured why his rural residence was denominated,
despite all the arguments of the ladies, <em>Wick-Hall</em>.</p>

<p>The next question that arose in the curious and impertinent minds
of those who must know the causation of all causes, was, how did it
come to pass that the arrival of the Earl of Wittington at Myrtle-Grove
should have induced, in a manner direct or indirect, the family of an
ex-tallow-chandler to migrate from a comfortable residence; to have
left Muckford and their Penates, their well-trimmed lawns, their
well-stocked gardens, their orchards and their paddocks, their dairy,
and their brew-house, and their wash-house, and their ice-house, and
their hot-house, their cosey fire-side and their snug bed-rooms, to
wander about the world, and dwell in cold and dreary, or in broiling
and stewing lodgings; drink sour <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ordinaire</i> wine instead of port,
sherry, gooseberry, and nut-brown October; be cheated and laughed
at by foreign servants, instead of being attended by worthy, homely,
and honest domestics; and become the ridicule of strangers, instead
of being respected and liked by their neighbours? How did it come
to pass that the Earl of Wittington's arrival should have driven the
Cannons away from their Eden? The reader who cannot guess it at
once,&mdash;who gives it up, like a hard riddle or a puzzling conundrum,&mdash;must
be stultified, unread, unsophisticated, never have subscribed to a
circulating library. However, as dulness of intellect is more a misfortune
than a fault, we shall kindly condescend to inform him.</p>

<p>Myrtle-Grove had long been untenanted. Mr. Cannon was the
wealthiest resident in or near the village; therefore was <em>Wick-Hall</em>
called "the squire's mansion." Now, stupid, do you take?</p>

<p>Everybody has read Joe Miller. Now it may be recollected that,
in that valuable vade-mecum of <em>very delightful</em> and <em>charming fellows</em>,
there is recorded the strange vanity of an ugly scholar in the College
of Navarre, who maintained most strenuously and syllogistically,&mdash;nay,
would have met any modern Crichton with a thesis on the subject
to show and prove, that he was the greatest man in the world; and he
argued that Europe being the finest part of the creation, France the most
delightful country in Europe, Paris the most splendid city in France,
the College of Navarre the most enlightened and precious establishment
in Paris, his room unquestionably the best chamber in the college,
and he most undoubtedly the greatest ornament in his room,
<em>ergo</em>, he was the greatest man in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same train of ratiocination did the Cannons come to the conclusion
that they were the magnates, the top-sawyers, the leaders of
fashion of the village of Muckford. They patronised the Rev. Mr.
Muzzle, the curate, whose meek back was suited to the burthen of
a wife and eight little ones on fifty pounds a year; Mr. Hiccup,
M.R.C.S., who, to the duties of his profession in the attendance
of man and beast, added the pursuits of rat and mole-catcher, perfumer,
stationer, and tobacconist; and Mr. Sniffnettle, the attorney,
solicitor, conveyancer, proctor, appraiser, auctioneer, poet-laureat
and parish-clerk. A <em>hop</em> at Wick-Hall was anticipated with as much
delight by all the young and old ladies as the opening of Almacks;
a game at loo or twopenny long-whist offered all the attractions of
Crockford's; and the Sunday visits after church were as distinguished
for figure and fashion as a St. James's drawing-room on a birth-day.</p>

<p>This high patrician stand in society unfortunately made the Cannons
proud,&mdash;some say haughty, supercilious, and arrogant. It might
have been so; such is the nature of frail mortality, for, alas!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"Pride has no other glass</div>
<div class="verse">To show itself but pride; for supple knees</div>
<div class="verse">Feed arrogance!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and Mr. Muzzle, and Dr. Hiccup, and Mr. Sniffnettle, had their <em>vertebræ</em>
and their articulations so greased, and oiled, and anti-attritioned,
that they would bob, and bend, and curl, and coil like a tom-cat's
tail, whenever they visited the mansion.</p>

<p>And strange dreams, and visions, and fantasies would be brewing
in the brains of Mr. Cannon, both when sleeping and awake. He
was wealthy; the Cannons had a dragon rampant for their crest, and
<em>Crepo</em> for their motto,&mdash;a motto that was traced to the discovery of a
bronze figure of the Egyptian god Crepitus in the tomb of one of his
noble ancestors. To this proud circumstance the family also owed
the Christian-name of "Commodus," which the elder Cannon always
bore,&mdash;Commodus being of Gallic origin. Sometimes Mr. Commodus
Cannon thought that he might purchase a peerage by paying some
damages incurred by indiscreet influential personages; sometimes he
fancied that he might be created a baronet upon a mortgage, or a
marriage of one of the Miss Cannons to some broken-down nobleman.</p>

<p>But, alas! how transient are the visions of glory! of worldly greatness!
Greatness&mdash;that gaudy torment of our soul!</p>


<p class="linequot">"The wise man's fetter, and the rage of fools!"</p>

<p>Lord Wittington arrived, and the Countess of Wittington, and the
Ladies Desdemona Catson, and Arabella Catson, and Celestina Catson,
and Euripida Catson, and the Hon. Tom Catson, and the Hon. Brindle
Catson, with their aunt, Lady Tabby Catson; and all Muckford
was in a state of commotion, of effervescence, of ebullition, boiling
over with hope and fear. A comet wagging its tail over their steeple,&mdash;an
eclipse, which would have set all the Muckfordians smoking bits
of glass, and picking up fragments of broken bottles for astronomical
observations,&mdash;could not have occasioned such a stir as the arrival of
four travelling carriages, with dickeys and rumbles crowded with ladies'
women, and gentlemen's gentlemen, rattling away with four
post-horses to Myrtle-Grove.</p>

<p>And now were speculations busily at work. The minds of Mahomet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and Confucius, of Galileo and Copernicus, of Locke and Bacon,
were idle when compared to the brains of the Muckfordians.
What was the point in question? Was it the increase of business
and of profit that would accrue from the consumption of these wealthy
visitors?&mdash;No. Was it the advantages that might be derived from their
parliamentary connexions and ministerial interest?&mdash;No. Was it the
hopes that their residence might induce other rich families to inhabit
the neighbourhood?&mdash;No&mdash;no&mdash;no! If the reader cannot guess,
he must have lived at the antipodes, or in a desert, or never lived
<em>in life</em>. The question was, "I wonder if his lordship and her ladyship
will visit Wick-Hall?" No treaty of alliance, of commerce, of
peace&mdash;no protocol that ever issued from the most perfect cerebral
organ in Downing-street&mdash;was ever weighed with more momentous
disquietude than this question, "I wonder if his lordship and her ladyship
will visit Wick-Hall?"</p>

<p>"I should think not," observed Mrs. Curate Muzzle; "the Wittingtons
are great folks, and the Cannons were chandlers!"</p>

<p>"Tallow-chandlers, my dear madam," remarked Mrs. Doctor Hiccup.</p>

<p>"Had they even been wax-chandlers," added Mrs. Sniffnettle.</p>

<p>"Or corn-chandlers," replied Mrs. Hiccup.</p>

<p>"But a tallow-chandler," exclaimed Mr. Sniffnettle, who, as we
have seen, was the laureat of Muckford, "as Gay says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'Whether black, or lighter dies are worn,</div>
<div class="verse">The chandler's basket, on his shoulders borne,</div>
<div class="verse">With tallow spots thy coat.'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This appropriate quotation not only drew forth a loud laugh of approbation,
but illumined the minds of the party as brightly as two
pounds of fours might have enlightened Mr. Hiccup's back-shop parlour
on a long-whist and welsh-rabbit night.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I wish them no harm," remarked Mrs. Muzzle, with a
benevolent smile; "but pride is a sad failing, which deserves to be
brought down."</p>

<p>"Oh, the deuce mend them!" rejoined Mrs. Sniffnettle; "if they're
brought to their proper bearings a peg or two."</p>

<p>"Because they had a little dirty cash&mdash;the Lord knows how they
made it!&mdash;they were as pert as a pear-monger's horse!" exclaimed
Mr. Hiccup.</p>

<p>"Pride comes first, shame comes after," added Mr. Sniffnettle.</p>

<p>"The priest forgets that he was a clerk," professionally observed
Mrs. Muzzle.</p>

<p>"I could put up with pride, now," said Mr. Hiccup, "from the
Wittingtons."</p>

<p>"Ay!" replied the poet, quoting Byron,</p>

<p class="linequot">'The vile are only vain, the great are proud.'"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" observed Mrs. Hiccup, who, like most persons doting
upon poesy, did not understand what she most admired.</p>

<p>Is it not strange that none of these ladies or gentlemen ever said
"I wonder if <em>we</em> shall be invited to Myrtle-Grove?"</p>

<p>Whoever expected or fancied that on such an occasion such a
thought could have entered any well-disposed and educated mind
must be an ass. Who cares, if they are at the foot of the ladder, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
those who are climbing up are properly rolled down? There is no need
of crying "Heads below!" the grovellers will all get out of the way,
and let the tumblers roll in the mire to their hearts' content. I
mean the hearts' content of the lookers-on.</p>

<p>Now, while this most important point was discussed by the chief
authorities of Muckford, a question of still greater importance was
agitated at Wick-Hall.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we ought to call first upon the Wittingtons, or wait
until they call upon us?" said Mrs. Cannon, after dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. Commodus Cannon halted a glassful of port that was marching
towards his mouth, and kept it suspended in air like Mahomet's
tomb.</p>

<p>Miss Molly Cannon delayed the cracking of a nut she had just
introduced between two ivory grinders.</p>

<p>Miss Biddy Cannon kept her hand under a roasted chestnut napkin,
unconscious of its temperature, without withdrawing it.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy Cannon cut into an orange she was carefully peeling
with a steel knife; a circumstance that would have produced a galvanic
thrill under other circumstances.</p>

<p>Miss Kitty Cannon filled a bumper of cherry brandy instead of
"just the least drop in the world."</p>

<p>Mr. Cannon, junior, drove a toothpick in his gums instead of his
teeth.</p>

<p>George Cannon started, and trod on the cat's tail.</p>

<p>Cornelius Cannon (commonly called Colcannon, having had an Irish
godfather,) made a horrible mistake, by drinking out of his finger-glass
instead of his tumbler.</p>

<p>Peter Cannon used his damask napkin instead of a pocket-handkerchief;
and Oliver Cannon, who had been lolling and rocking his chair,
rolled off his centre of gravity.</p>

<p>A dead silence followed the important question. The ghost of Chesterfield
ought in mercy to have burst from his cerements to have
answered it. Mr. Cannon first ventured to give an opinion&mdash;a judicious
opinion.</p>

<p>"Why, as to the matter of that," he said, scratching his brown
wig,&mdash;which was, by-the-bye, an action which might have been called
manual tautology, since it was a scratch already,&mdash;"as to the matter of
that, it is clear that, if we are to be acquainted with his lordship, they
must call upon us, or we must call upon them."</p>

<p>Now, it is a matter worthy of consideration, that, in difficult
and knotty points, perspicuity of language seldom or ever elucidates
the business. Nothing could be more clear, more lucid, nay, more
pellucid, than Mr. Commodus Cannon's remark,&mdash;more self-evident,
more conclusive,&mdash;yet it only tended to make darkness visible. Mrs.
Cannon, who possessed greater powers of eloquence, was therefore
imperiously called upon for a rejoinder.</p>

<p>"If you could think, Mr. Cannon, of waiting until my Lord What-do-you-call-him
thinks proper to <em>honour</em> us with a call, you are a
mean-spirited, petty-minded fellow. I'd have you to know we are
every inch as good as they are."</p>

<p>"To be sure we are!" replied all the Cannons in one simultaneous
and spontaneous roar, one well-fired volley of approbation without a
straggling shot,&mdash;all but Mr. Cannon senior, who remained as still as
a target.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"We owe nothing to nobody," added the speaker; "and can hold
up our heads as high as anybody that ever wore one."</p>

<p>This reloaded the Cannons, and another fire of coincidence was
let off.</p>

<p>"If your nobility give themselves airs with us, let me tell you, Mr.
Cannon, just look at your crest and your motto, and show them that
you can let fly at them hollow."</p>

<p>All applauded except Mr. Cornelius Cannon, who was a good Latin
scholar.</p>

<p>"For my part I wouldn't give a brass farthing&mdash;no, that's what I
wouldn't&mdash;to know them, as it's ten to one they will be shortly wanting
to borrow money from us; but, as we are neighbours, and we are longer
resident at Muckford, it's our business to leave our cards with them,
more especially as there's no <em>quality</em> whatever in this here neighbourhood
but ourselves."</p>

<p>There was no necessity of putting this proposition to the vote; it
was carried by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nem. diss.</i> acclamations, and the visit fixed upon that
day week.</p>

<p>Now, strange to say, by one of those singular anomalies in the
human mind that puzzle metaphysicians, psychologists, materialists,
and immaterialists, although this acquaintance with the family of
Myrtle-Grove was not, to use Mrs. Cannon's expression, "worth a
brass farthing," everything in the house, from the furniture to the
young ladies, was turned topsy-turvy for a week. There was nothing
but dusting, and polishing, and furbishing, and scrubbing, and rubbing,
and bees'-waxing, and varnishing, and tweezing, and plucking,
and puffing, and blowing at all ends; and swearing, and cursing, and
shouting from the top of the stairs to come up, and bellowing from
the foot of the stairs to come down; and souls, and eyes, and blood,
and bones were sent the Lord knows where by the impatient gentlemen,
while the ladies, who were too well bred to pronounce the vulgar
name of the infernal regions, only wished every servant in the
house a visit to the monarch of that grilling kingdom every hour
of the day; and every horse, and every ass, nay, the very colts and
fillies, shod and unshod, broken or unbroken, were sent to and fro
from Wick-Hall to the neighbouring town, like buckets up and down
a well, for silks, and ribands, and bobbins, and laces, and caps, and
bonnets, and feathers, furs, and furbelows, and rouge-pots, and cold
cream, and antique oil, and pomatum, and washes, and lotions, Circassian
and Georgian, that were ever employed since the days of Jezebel
to scrub out freckles and wrinkles, fill up pits and creases,
pucker relaxed fibres and relax puckerings, eradicate warts, pimples,
blossoms, excrescences, efflorescences, and effluences; with collyria
for red eyes, and ointments for crusty eye-lids, liniments for gummy
ankles, with odoriferous and balsamic tooth-powders, and gargles;
with stores of swan and goose down for gigots, and rear-admirals, and
polissons, and bussels; not to mention the means of throwing out various
forms that distinguish the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</i> of the undulating line from
the rigid severity of the straight line and the acute angle; while all
the wigs, tops, toupets, fronts, tresses, plaits, curls, ringlets, black,
brown, auburn, fair, and foxy, were put into requisition.</p>

<p>It was not only physical brushing up that was resorted to; the
mind received a proper frizzing; and Debrett's Peerage and Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Miller, the Racing-calendar and the Court-guide, were studied during
every leisure moment; while all the scandal-registering Sunday
papers were devoured with avidity.</p>

<p>Various were the accidents that arose in this confusion. Biddy Cannon
broke a blood-vessel in straining her voice to D alt. in practising a
fashionable Italian song. A pet cat of the same (who had been trodden
on by George Cannon) was well nigh scalded to death by the
overboiling of a pipkin of oil of cucumber for Lucy Cannon's sunburns;
and Kitty Cannon caught a desperate sore-throat in trying
to catch a hint of a fashionable walking-dress one rainy morning
that the Ladies Catsons were riding out, peeping at them under a
heavy shower from behind a holly hedge. Poor Kitty Cannon was in
a most piteous plight from having made a trifling mistake in the use
of some medicines sent her by Mr. Hiccup; for, in a very great hurry
to try on an invisible corset, she rubbed her throat with some palma
Christi oil, and swallowed a hartshorn liniment that had been intended
for external use. In her burning agonies she of course kept the
whole house in hot water, for everybody was so busy that nobody
could attend upon the poor sufferer; who, unable to call out, and having
torn up her bell by the roots, was only able to attract attention
to her wants by throwing every thing she could lay hands on about
the room, more especially water-jugs, basins, physic bottles, and
every vessel within her reach. Mrs. Cannon swore she was an unnatural
child; and her sisters accused her of being ill-natured and jealous
when she disturbed them in their important occupations. In short,
the Tower of Babel, or the Commons on an Irish question, were nothing
to Wick-Hall, in-doors and out-of-doors, where the young Cannons
were grooming, and docking, and trimming, and figging their
horses.</p>

<p>Mr. Commodus Cannon was the wisest of the party; he smoked
his pipe, muddled over a bowl of punch, and only ordered his scratch
wig to be <em>curled tight</em>, with the not unfrequent vulgar wish that the
whole family might be <em>blown</em> to the same exiguous dimensions. He
was ambitious, but he did not like to be <em>bothered</em> with any schemes
but his own.</p>

<p>The day, the great day, big with the fate of the Cannons, was
drawing nigh, and impatiently looked for, as a circumstance had taken
place which gave the Wick-Hall family much to think of and inwardly
digest.</p>

<p>Lady Tabby Catson, his lordship's aunt, was subject to night-mare
and sleep-walking when in bed, and liable to fearful hysterics
when out of it. Her case was altogether most distressing, since,
according to her account, she could not lie on either side, was in
agony when on her back, and distracted in any other position. A
physician was called in, but, as he could only pay occasional visits,
Mr. Hiccup was in constant attendance; and as the Ladies Catsons
were well supplied with novels, and were of a most amiable disposition,
Hiccup carried various new publications to his daughters, who
immediately ran to show them to the Miss Cannons, calling the ladies
by their Christian names with singular impertinence,&mdash;such a book
having been lent by the beautiful Lady Arabella,&mdash;such a review by
the lovely Lady Celestina. Moreover, Lady Tabby Catson, during
the intermissions of her ailments, had fits of devotion that took her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
like stitches in the side, when Mr. Muzzle was instantly sent for in
one of the carriages. Thus were the curate and the surgeon in constant
attendance, and many little acts of kindness shown to them by
the family, such as presents of fruits and flowers, all of which passed
under the windows of Wick-Hall like the fearful regal apparitions to
Macbeth; and, what was still more offensive, the favoured families,
even the attorney, Sniffnettle, began to grow rigid in their vertebræ
though in the heat of summer, walking past the Cannons with a mere
nod of recognition, and preserving an insulting perpendicularity.</p>

<p>There was no time to lose in recovering their lost ground, and the
day for commencing a campaign that would terminate in the utter
discomfiture of these vulgar intruders was fast approaching. But,
alas for human and mortal hopes! one hour,&mdash;nay, one half-hour,&mdash;one
quarter,&mdash;the time of reading a letter on foolscap paper, on letter
paper, on note paper, only a few lines written in an intelligible unauthor-like
hand, that required neither time nor spectacles, a hand
that could be read running,&mdash;and all the airy fabric of the Cannons'
visions was dissolved.</p>

<p>It was on a Friday morning, the day previous to the intended visit,&mdash;one
of those unlucky days in the calendar of human disappointments,
the fifth day of the month, which, according to Hesiod, is inevitably
calamitous; a day that gave birth to Pluto and the Eumenides; a
day when the earth brought forth the monster Typhon, and those
vile giants who dared the Father of the gods,&mdash;on this day did Mr.
Commodus Cannon draw on his stockings the wrong side, the eldest
Miss Cannon&mdash;I know not why or wherefore&mdash;took a morning walk
among the nettles, and her sister Biddy spilled salt at breakfast, forgetting
to propitiate the angry heavens by casting some over her left
shoulder. A thundering rap at the hall-door made the whole family
jump, start, and stare. A footman in the Wittington livery was at
the door! he delivered a letter! Oh! how all the young hearts did
beat and leap! and how the old fount of circulation of Mrs. Cannon
did palpitate, as in days of yore! Scarcely had the door been closed,
when the whole family, with the exception of Mr. Cannon, who was
buttering toast, rushed like a torrent, or a cataract, or any thing else
you like, to secure the missive, anxious as they were to ascertain its
contents. Much time was lost in scrambling for possession of the
letter, snatched alternately from hand to hand without any regard to
filial duty or the rights of primogeniture. At last the letter, be-buttered,
be-honeyed, be-marmaladed, and be-egged, fell into the possession
of Miss Cannon. But oh! horror! instead of the broad armorial
seal of the noble earl, the note was wafered!&mdash;ay, gentle reader, wafered!&mdash;moreover,
the wafer, still damp, had been broken, and bent,
and divided, exhibiting evident marks of having been moistened by an
abundant secretion of the salivary glands! Oh, fie, my Lord W.!</p>

<p>Philosophers and naturalists tell us there is a method in roasting
eggs; now there is a method in closing letters, which has lately been
adopted by a nobleman whom I have the honour to know, which may
be considered a wrinkle in politeness. To his superiors, such as emperors,
kings, popes, and newspaper editors, his lordship writes on coloured,
perfumed, ornamented, and gilt-edged satin paper, and he
closes his epistle with his armorials, six of which usually consume a
stick of odoriferous wax. To his equals, though they are but few, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
writes on paper somewhat inferior, with a smaller seal. To his titled
inferiors, plain note paper, with a crest and motto. To his untitled
correspondents, half a sheet of letter paper (it must be cut in an uneven
and ragged manner), with a fancy seal, that his noble blazon
may not be polluted by vulgar eyes. To people in business, cits,
snobs, a wafer&mdash;but still a wafer&mdash;gently dipped in water. But
to solicitors, postulants, petitioners, and humble applicants, he actually
spits in their faces in the same manner as the Earl of Wittington
spat in the crimson phiz of all the Cannons. But the offence did not
rest there. <span class="smcap">Mr. Cannon</span> was on the superscription! ay, a plain <span class="smcap">Mr.</span>!
a <em>Mr.</em> that could only be washed out in blood! a <em>Mr.</em> that would even
make a respectable tailor jump from his shopboard, and grasp his
goose with proper indignation.</p>

<p>"Lord Wittington, wishing to become the purchaser of Mr. Cannon's
paddock under Breakneck-Cliff, part of his domain, is willing to
treat with him, and will direct his steward to call upon him. His
lordship has been led to understand that Mr. Cannon's young men
have been in the practice of shooting on his grounds; now his lordship
wishes it to be distinctly understood that his keepers have received
instructions to proceed with all the severity of the laws
against trespassers."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cannon of course fell into fits; Commodus Cannon cast his
scratch <em>jasey</em> into the fire; some of the young ladies rushed out of
the room; others, in whom no rush had been left, drooped in or
on various supporting parts of the furniture. The <em>young men</em>, as
his lordship had dared to call Mr. Cannon's promising and amiable
sons, bore the insult with all the calm dignity of men wantonly offended;
they only bit their lips, turned pale and red, clenched their
fists, and paced about the room at the rate of fourteen miles per
hour, while the words "young men" were muttered and murmured
in deadly indignation.</p>

<p>"I'll be d&mdash;&mdash;d if the fellow ever gets my paddock! sooner see him,
and all his seed, breed, and generation, tumbling off Breakneck-Cliff!"</p>

<p>The allocution of Leonidas to his Spartan heroes at the Thermopylæ
could not have been more spirit-stirring than this short and
pithy speech of Commodus Cannon; even Mrs. Cannon, forgetting,
in a moment of just indignation, that female discretion that ought
to characterise a lady's language, could not help supporting the
vote by an amendment, exclaiming, "Ay, and doubly d&mdash;&mdash;d too!"</p>

<p>"And, moreover," added Mr. Cannon, "I'll be blown if I don't
stick my paddock chokefull of buck-wheat, and not leave the fellow
a pheasant or a partridge,&mdash;that's what I will!"</p>

<p>It is difficult to say what dire plans of destruction and desolation
might not have been suggested in the family council, had not another
rap at the door, louder, if possible, and more authoritative
than the footman's, interrupted the discussion. All and every one
ran to the windows. Mr. Carrydot, Lord Wittington's steward, was
at the entrance of Wick-Hall, and desired a private interview with
Mr. Cannon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cannon reluctantly swept out of the room, followed by all
the young ladies and the <em>young men</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Carrydot was a smart, dapper, little man, with a bald head, ferret
eyes, aquiline nose tipped with purple, and with a prying countenance
that would have picked out flaws in Magna Charta or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Bill of Rights. His costume sable; but coat, waistcoat, and unavoidables
to match, were all of a different black, more or less rusty and
shining; his coat-sleeves, or rather cuffs, were short, and allowed
his duty wristbands to be seen puckered up above his hairy and
meagre hands, and bony, long, crooked fingers, with hooked nails in
half mourning. How comes it that the coat-sleeves of certain petty
attorneys and apothecaries are generally too short, save and excepting
when they have donned their Sabbath and visiting raiment? It
surely must arise from the usual practice of extending the arms beyond
the limits of their restrictions whenever a body is going to
perform some dirty business, possibly and probably that the said
dirty business may not stain the cloth they wear, since a cloth may
be respectable although the wearer may be as spotted as a panther.
Mr. Carrydot walked, or rather stalked in; and, without a bow or a
preamble, seated himself, without being asked to take a seat.</p>

<p>Cannon looked an encyclopedia of indignation.</p>

<p>"His lordship has directed me to call upon you, Mr. Cannon,
regarding the approaching county election. You can command
several votes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Of course, sir," replied Mr. Cannon, with a proper emphasis
and conciseness.</p>

<p>"You are aware, sir, that his lordship intends to put up Mr.
Elfin Eelback, of Stoop-Lodge?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir! what's that to me? What do I care for his lordship's
candidate?"</p>

<p>Bravo, Cannon! Mrs. Cannon would have inflicted a kiss had she
been present.</p>

<p>Mr. Carrydot's eyes glared with indignation, and beamed with <em>ousters</em>
and <em>ejectments</em>, as he repeated the words, "What's that to you, sir!"</p>

<p>"Ay!" replied Cannon, giving the table a liberal thump. "What
the devil is it to me?"</p>

<p>"Why, his lordship desires that you will vote for Mr. Eelback."</p>

<p>"Then tell his lordship that I'd sooner see Mr. Eelback skinned
alive!"</p>

<p>Cannon was furious. Carrydot was calm, nay, he smiled; for the
fury of Cannon spoke volumes of prospective <em>foreclosures</em>, and <em>distresses</em>,
and <em>rescous</em>, and <em>replevin</em>, and <em>denial</em>; more especially as Cannon
seemed to be a <em>good man</em>, with a silver urn and tea-pot on the table,
and every appearance of wealth and independence about the goods
and chattels on the premises. "You seem to forget, sir," he quietly
replied, "that you only hold Wick-Hall upon a lease, and that your
interest in the lease expires next Michaelmas."</p>

<p>This was a thunderbolt to Cannon, who had laid out upwards of
three thousand pounds on Wick-Hall.</p>

<p>"What, sir, if I refuse to vote for this Eelback?"</p>

<p>"You must turn out, sir, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens volens</i>; so sayeth the law!"</p>

<p>"But justice, sir?"</p>

<p>"So sayeth the law. Every man has a right to do what he likes
with his own, Mr. Cannon."</p>

<p>"What! whatever my political opinions may be?"</p>

<p>"You must poll for his lordship's candidate."</p>

<p>"This is infamous, oppressive, tyrannical!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you may think so. Your politics, as you say, may differ
from those of his lordship, but his lordship must be in the right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Primò</i>, he is lord of the manor; <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">secundò</i>, his property in the county
is very considerable; and, <em>ergo</em>, he has a better right to know what
is good for the people than a mere tenant."</p>

<p>"But, sir, he has no right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Once more, sir, every one has a right to do what he likes with
his own."</p>

<p>"Then, let me tell you, sir," replied Mr. Cannon, in a paroxysm
of rage, "that there cudgel is my own, and suppose I knocked you
down with it? This here foot is my own, and suppose I kicked you
out of my house, Mr. Thingembob?"</p>

<p>"In that case," replied Carrydot, with a tranquillity which would
have made Job himself smash all his crockery,&mdash;"In that case, sir, if
you made use of that <em>there</em> cudgel, as you call it, the law would
soon make you <em>cut your stick</em>; and if you did make the aforesaid use
of that <em>there</em> foot, unless you took <em>leg-bail</em>, you should pay dearly for
the experiment."</p>

<p>So saying, Mr. Carrydot took an enormous pinch of snuff, clapped
on his broad beaver with forensic dignity, pulled up his coat-sleeves
still higher with a twisting thrust of the hand, ready for anything&mdash;as
the Irish say&mdash;from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter, and bidding Cannon,
in a vulgar language unbecoming a solicitor, to prepare "to tip
his rags a gallop by roast-goose time," which in the dignified metaphorical
phraseology of the bar meaneth Michaelmas, he left Commodus
Cannon to his deep reflections.</p>

<p>He was roused from this apathetic state by the entrance of Mrs.
Cannon. "Well, sir?" said she, in an anxious tone. "Well, sir?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Cannon, I regret it, but we <em>must</em> have a revolution in this
here slavish, this here degraded country!"</p>

<p>"Lord-a-mercy! what has happened?" replied his affrighted lady.</p>

<p>"It is not what has happened, madam," replied the regenerated
free-born Briton; "it is what shall happen. By gums!&mdash;(he was already
beginning to be somewhat puritanical and sanctified; the day
before, nay, a few moments previous to Carrydot's entrance, he would
have sworn by G&mdash;, like any duke or marquis,)&mdash;by gums! this here
proud big-wig aristocracy must be brought down; nothing can save
poor England but the abolition of this insolent peerage, these hereditary
law-makers from father to son. I say, no peers! no bishops!
no lords! a yearly parliament! universal sufferance!&mdash;(it is presumed
he meant suffrage,)&mdash;vote by ballot! Throw up your pew, Mrs.
Cannon! kick the tax-gatherer down stairs! I'll kick the fat gold-laced
beadle myself! and tell Parson Muzzle that he's a humbug
and a leech!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Cannon, and all the Cannons, great-guns and small-arms,
were terrified, and fancied the worthy man was out of his senses.
She proposed to send for Mr. Hiccup.</p>

<p>"Hiccup be d&mdash;d! Do you think, woman, that Hiccup would
condescend to come to you and me were we kicking in fits, dying with
the pip, or had swallowed a mutton-chop the wrong way? Hiccup is
with his lordship, with the Most noble, the Right honourable the Earl
of Wittington, the Right honourable the Lady Tabby Catson! If
their noble fingers ached, 'twould be in the Gazette, so it would. If
they got a surfeit from cramming turtle down their noble throats,
it would be in the papers! Hiccup! the rascal! the Tory pill-gilder!
wouldn't give a commoner, an independent citizen, or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
honest pauper, second-hand physic if a lord wanted him! No, not
to save a fellow Christian's life!"</p>

<p>All this was inexplicable to the open-mouthed and alarmed family,
when a sudden burst of tears followed this violent paroxysm;
and the Cannon circle, drawing round their chief with becoming uneasiness,
were soon made <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</i> to the full extent of the fresh indignities
offered their name and fame.</p>

<p>What was to be done? To remain at Wick-Hall after such an
insult would have been the height of degradation; to keep possession
of it at the expense of conscience by voting for Mr. Eelback, an
abnegation of a freeman's independence. All was doubt; and the
thoughts of the Cannon family were, to use the words of Otway,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi4">"Like birds, that, frighted from their rest,</div>
<div class="verse">Around the place where all was hush'd before,</div>
<div class="verse">Flutter, and hardly flutter, and hardly settle anywhere,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>when another nerve-upsetting rapping at the hall once more interrupted
the busy circle. Mr. and Mrs. Grits were announced.</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Grits?" exclaimed Mrs. Cannon.</p>

<p>The question was answered by Mrs. Grits in person; and in her,
to her utter horror, Mrs. Cannon recognised the daughter of Mr.
Suet, a carcase butcher, who had lived near them when Mr. C. was
in the tallow line.</p>

<p>To see her at Muckford appeared to Mrs. Cannon as wonderful
as though she had beheld the spirits of all the bullocks Mr. Suet had
ever slaughtered scampering about Smithfield. The ex-Miss Suet
explained matters. She had married Mr. Grits, a grocer, who had
failed thrice, once a bankrupt, and twice an insolvent, by which
means he had realised a tolerable independence; yet, for appearance
sake, he preferred improving his condition with the means of others,
and had travelled abroad as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d'hôtel</i>, with the Wittingtons.</p>

<p>At another time,&mdash;nay, a few hours before their visit,&mdash;the Grits
would not have been received; now, in the distressed state of the
family, they were welcomed with cordiality.</p>

<p>But the mind sickens at the object of their visit,&mdash;to advise Mr.
Cannon to accede to his lordship's proposals, and not irritate a powerful
enemy by an idle show of independence!!&mdash;But to think of a
reconciliation brought about by a butcher's daughter and a butler!&mdash;No,
no, thrice no;&mdash;the breach was immeasurably widened. Mr.
Cannon stuttered and stammered all the insults that had been heaped
upon him. Mrs. Grits plainly saw that no pacification could be
expected; and, although she expressed the utmost regret, she was
inwardly delighted, as it did not exactly suit her views that she
should be known to be a butcher's daughter. She, therefore, seizing
both Mrs. Cannon's trembling hands in the kindest manner, attempted
to console and advise her.</p>

<p>"I can readily imagine, my dear friend, how much this overbearing
conduct of my lord should have annoyed you. Oh! he is as
proud as Lucifer when he goes to open his parliament! It is such
men, my dear, that make me abhor this horrible England."</p>

<p>"Ay, horrible England!" repeated Mr. Cannon with ferocity.</p>

<p>"I have lived too long in that dear delicious France, that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle
France</i>, to exist, or rather vegetate, in this abominable country."</p>

<p>This word, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">France</i>," acted like a magic spell; it seemed a password,
a <em>Shibboleth</em>, an <em>open sesame</em> to regions of delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, France is the country! only ask Mr. Grits."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's nothing like it!" responded Mr. Grits, a jolly red-faced
fellow, with an enormous abdomen, rendered more <em>salient</em> by
a flapped white waistcoat.</p>

<p>"And such society, oh! such an opening for young people, oh!
No one asks who and what you are, only have the caraways! Lord
bless me! there was Mrs. Triplet, the pawnbroker of Islington's wife,
married her daughter Peg to a French count; and Mr. Rumstuff, the
tailor in the Minories, married his daughter to a general,&mdash;ay, a real
general; and then, such living, and such society, and such amusements!
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gardes du corps</i> with such nice moustaches, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâtés de
truffes</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">omelettes soufflées</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bals champêtres</i> at Tivoli, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glasses</i>
at Tortoni's, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poulets à la crapaudine</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salmis de lièvre</i>, and then,
the masked-balls at the opera, oh! and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des &oelig;ufs à la neige</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des
&oelig;ufs au miroir</i>! How many ways have the French of cooking eggs,
Mr. G.?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred and forty-three, Mrs. G."</p>

<p>"Only think of that! I make Mr. G. live upon eggs <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la coque</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à
la tripe</i>. And then meat at fourpence per pound!"</p>

<p>"Fivepence halfpenny for prime joints, if you please, Mrs. G." added
Mr. G.</p>

<p>"And such poultry! such capons! You have no capons in England,
my dear. Bless us, they don't know what's what! and so many
delicious ways of cooking them, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapon à la barbare</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapon à la
Veluti</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapon au parfait amour</i>; and then, the Hussars, and the
Lancers, and the horse and foot dragoons. Oh! women there may
do whatever they like! and girls may string lovers like a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brochette of
ortolans</i>!"</p>

<p>In short, Mrs. Grits gave such a flattering account of France, its
pleasures, its cookery, and its economy, that it was decided that to
France the family should go. Mr. Cannon said he was too old
to learn to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parlez-vous</i>, but the ladies procured grammars and dictionaries,
to brush up their boarding-school education; and in ten
days the whole family were packed up in three travelling carriages,
and set out for Dover; their only domestics, Sam Surly, a Yorkshire
coachman, and Sukey Simper, a Kentish maid, whom we shall again
find on the road.</p>

<p>Such is the ingratitude of mankind that all Muckford was delighted
with their departure. "<em>Hurrah! All the Cannons are gone
off!</em>" exclaimed Mr. Sniffnettle.</p>

<p>Lady Tabby Catson died soon after, leaving a handsome legacy
to Mr. Hiccup, the surgeon. Muzzle got a living, and resided at
Wick-Hall, the name of which he changed into <em>Cushion-Lodge</em>, alluding,
no doubt, to the <em>otium</em> he enjoyed. Sniffnettle was made
under-steward of Lord Wittington's estate; and Mr. Grits opened an
inn at the sign of the <em>Mitre</em>, opposite <em>Cushion-Lodge</em>, and, as the Rev.
Mr. Muzzle had been appointed tutor to the youngest of the honourable
Catsons, whenever he saw the sign bearing the episcopal diadem
swinging in the wind, despite all humility, a warrantable ambition
would often lead him to an association of ideas in which a crosier
acted as a favourite crotchet; nay, in his sleep sometimes Queen
Mab would tickle his nose until he dreamt of bishopricks, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">congés
d'élire</i>, and visitation dinners, and then he would suddenly awake
and terrify Mrs. Muzzle, roaring out "<span class="smcap">Nolo Episcopari!</span>"</p>

<p class="linequot">"And Laughter holding both his sides."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Milton.</span></p>


<p>If you were to ask a learned physician to explain to you the peculiar
sensation termed laughter, it is more than likely he would astonish
you with an amazing profundity of erudition, ending in the sage
conclusion that he knows nothing more about the matter than that it
is a very natural emotion of the senses, generally originating with a
good joke, and not unfrequently terminating in a fit of indigestion. If
he happened to be (as there are many) a priggish quack, it is not unlikely
he would add as a sequel, that it was a most injurious and unmannerly
indulgence, particularly favouring a determination of blood
to the head, and decidedly calculated to injure the fine nerves of the
facial organ! If, on the contrary, he should be a good, honest follower
of Galen, he would not fail to pronounce it the most fearful
enemy to his profession, as being altogether incompatible with physic
and the blues, and, by way of illustration, he might go so far as to
read a chapter of Tom Hood's best, in order to prove the strength
of his position.</p>

<p>Laughter&mdash;good, hearty, cheerful-hearted laughter&mdash;is the echo of
a happy spirit, the attribute of a cloudless mind. Life without it
were without hope, for it is the exuberance of hope. It is an emotion
possessed by man alone,&mdash;the happy light that relieves the dark
picture of life.</p>

<p>We laugh most, when we are young; the thoughts are then free
and unfettered, there is nothing to bind their fierce impulse, and
we sport with the passions with the bold daring of ignorance. Smiles
and tears, it has been observed, follow each other like gloom and sunshine;
so the childish note of mirth treads on the heels of sorrow. It
was but yesterday we noticed a little urchin writhing apparently in
the agony of anguish; he had been punished for some trivial delinquency,
and his little spirit resented it most gloriously. How the
young dog roared! His little chest heaved up and down; and every
blue vein on his pure forehead was apparent,&mdash;bursting with passion.
Anon, a conciliatory word was addressed to him by the offended
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouvernante</i>; a smile passed over the boy's face; his little eyes, sparkling
through a cloud of tears, were thrown upwards; a short struggle
between pride and some other powerful feeling ensued; and then
there burst forth such a peal of laughter, so clear, so full, so round, it
would have touched the heart of a stoic!</p>

<p>Our natural passions and emotions become subdued, or altogether
changed, as we enter the world. The laugh of the schoolboy is checked
by the frown of the master. He is acquiring wisdom, and wisdom
(ye Gods, how dearly bought!) is incompatible with laughter.
But still, at times, when loosened from his shackles, the pining student
will burst forth as in days gone by: but he has no longer the
cue and action for passion he then had; the cares of the world have
already mingled themselves in his cup, and his young spirit is drooping
beneath their influence. The laughter of boyhood is a merry
carol; but the first rich blush has already passed away. The boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
enters the world, full of the gay buoyancy of youth. He looks upon
those he meets as the playmates of other hours. But Experience
teaches him her lessons; the natural feelings of his heart are checked;
he may laugh and talk as formerly, but the spell, the dreams
that cast such a halo round his young days, are dissipated and
broken.</p>

<p>There are fifty different classes of laughers. There is your smooth-faced
politic laugher, your laugher by rule. These beings are generally
found within the precincts of a court, at the heels of some great
man, to whose conduct they shape their passions as a model. Does
his lordship say a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i>, it is caught up and grinned at in every
possible manner till, the powers of grimace expended, his lordship is
pleased to change the subject, and strike a different chord. And it
is not astonishing. Who would refuse to laugh for a pension of two
hundred a year? Common gratitude demands it.</p>

<p>There is, then, your habitual laugher, men who laugh by habit,
without rhyme or reason. They are generally stout, piggy-faced
gentlemen, who eat hearty suppers, and patronise free-and-easys.
They will meet you with a grin on their countenance, which, before
you have said three sentences, will resolve itself into a simper, and
terminate finally in a stentorian laugh. These men may truly be said
to go through life laughing; but habit has blunted the finer edges of
their sympathies, and their mirth is but the unmeaning effusion of a
weak spirit. These personages generally go off in fits of apoplexy,
brought on by excessive laughter on a full stomach!</p>

<p>There is, then, your discontented cynical laugher, who makes a
mask of mirth to conceal the venom of his mind. It is a dead fraud
that ought not to be pardoned. Speak to one of these men of happiness,
virtue, &amp;c. he meets you with a sneer, or a bottle-imp kind of
chuckle; talk to him of any felicitous circumstance, he checks you
with a sardonic grin, that freezes your best intentions. He is a type
of the death's head the Egyptians placed at their feasts to check exuberant
gaiety.</p>

<p>There is, then, your fashionable simperer, your laugher <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à-la-mode</i>,
your inward digester of small jokes and tittle-tattle. <em>He</em> never laughs,&mdash;it
is a vulgar habit; the only wonder is, that he eats. People,
he will tell you, should overcome these vulgar propensities; they are
abominable. A young man of this class is generally consumptive,
his lungs have no play, he is always weak and narrow-chested; he vegetates
till fifty, and then goes off, overcome with a puff of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau de
rose</i>, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">millefleur</i>, he has encountered accidentally from the pocket-handkerchief
of a cheesemonger's wife!</p>

<p>Last of all, there is your real, good, honest laugher; the man who
has a heart to feel and sympathize with the joys and sorrows of
others; who has gone through life superior to its follies, and has
learnt to gather wisdom even from laughter. Such are the men
who do honour to society, who have learnt to be temperate in prosperity,
patient in adversity; and, who, having gathered experience
from years, are content to drink the cup of life mingled as it is, to
enjoy calmly the sweeter portion, and laugh at the bitter.</p>

<p>There is a strange affinity in our passions. The heart will frequently
reply to the saddest intelligence by a burst of the most unruly
laughter, the effigy of mirth. It seems as though the passion, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
rude torrent, were too strong to pursue its ordinary course; but,
breaking forth from the narrow channel that confined it, rushed forth
in one broad impetuous stream. It is the voice of anguish that has
chosen a different garb, and would cheat the sympathies. But we
have ourselves been demonstrating the truth of our last proposition;
for we have been writing on laughter till we have grown sad. But
what says the old song?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>I alighted with my friend at the caravanserai where the coach
had stopped, and there he advised me to put up for the night,
promising to come on the following morning to assist me in procuring
a lodging.</p>

<p>"But first tell me," said I, "who are the two persons who
were so violently opposed to each other."</p>

<p>"The fair man," said he, "is one of our <em>omrahs</em> or lords; the
other is one of the middle ranks, who has made himself conspicuous
by advocating the cause of the people. Our whole country
is principally divided into two factions, holding their opinions.
There is also a moderate set who do not partake of their
violence, but unfortunately their voice is not sufficiently heard.
But we will talk more upon these matters again," said he, and
then left me.</p>

<p>The next day he came, and without much difficulty succeeded
in settling me in a lodging, where I found everything prepared
to receive me, as well as if the Shah's chief tent-pitcher had
preceded me to give the requisite orders. The English habits,
which I had acquired when here before in the days of our
embassy, returned as fast as I recognised the objects which
before had been familiar to my sight, but which had been
much obliterated by my absence in Persia. I again sat upon
chairs instead of my heels; again I ate with knives and forks
instead of my fingers; and once more I found myself called
upon to walk about upon my own legs with the activity of
a Franc, instead of making use of a horse to take me daily
to attend the Shah's selam, or to sit at the Royal Gate in attendance
upon the Grand Vizier.</p>

<p>I had always a memory for localities; places which I had
once seen I scarcely ever forgot; thus I was at no loss to find
my way about the city. Of the language I remembered enough
to make myself understood; and so far I felt independent, and
needed not the attendance of a <em>mehmander</em>. I thanked my
friend Jan for all his kindness; and assured him, whenever I
was in any difficulty, or whenever I required information upon
matters relating to his country, I would not fail to call upon
him.</p>

<p>The lodgings in which I had taken up my abode were situated
in a large house that looked upon a garden inclosed by
iron spikes. It was a better sort of caravanserai, greatly resorted
to by people of all nations; Francs, from different parts of
Frangistan, who spoke each their different language, and adapted
themselves as well as they could to the manners of the English.
I was visited by the landlord, a well-looking, well-spoken
man, and his wife, an elderly lady, who, having come once to see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
as the English frequently say, that I was comfortable, did not
again trouble me by their presence. I occupied two rooms;
one to sit in and receive my guests, the other to sleep in. My
servant, Mahboob, slept in another room close to mine.</p>

<p>My first care was to walk out to take a survey of the city,
in order to discover those symptoms of ruin and poverty which
I had so frequently been assured were spreading over England,
and marking her downfall. I soon found myself in a street, of
whose magnificence I had no recollection. It seemed composed
of entirely new houses. The shops, which were opened on each
side, were so brilliant, and seemed to be so overflowing with
merchandise and riches of all sorts, that my senses seemed to
have escaped from my head as I looked on in astonishment; and
ever and anon I found myself standing with my finger in my
mouth, exclaiming, "Bah! bah! bah!" "Is this decay?" thought
I. "Can this people be really on the brink of ruin? There
must be something more in this than I can understand." The
street was positively more thronged with men and women than
even one of the most crowded bazars of Ispahan. I saw more
carriages, more horses, more carts, and more stir, than I recollected
to have seen when here before. Every one seemed busy,
and bustled along, as if all depended upon their haste. Whence
they were coming, whither going, who could say? Were they
all thinking of ruin, or were they bent upon happiness? I
was longing to stop and ask each person what had happened, so
very uncommon was this state of things compared with what I
had been accustomed to witness in my own country, or even in
the European countries through which I had travelled. I continued
to walk through this astonishing street, thinking I should
never come to the end of it, when I reached a magnificent opening,
where, to my still greater astonishment, I discovered an unbounded
prospect of dazzling white palaces, standing amidst
gardens and fields, and looking like the habitations of the
blessed in the seventh heaven promised to us by the Prophet.
"Can this be decay?" again I exclaimed. "These people must
have a different way of going to ruin, to the one which I have
been accustomed to contemplate. In my country ruin speaks
for itself. At Ispahan we see whole districts of broken walls
which once were houses, tottering mosques, deserted baths, and
untenanted caravanserais. But here, in the short space of
twelve years, here is a new creation; unbounded prosperity
seems here to speak for itself; and, if this be a country of paupers,
what are we to call riches?"</p>

<p>As I was turning my steps homewards, I was struck all at
once with the conviction that I was near the spot (a spot which
had never left my imagination) where, enamoured as I then was
of the moonfaced Bessy, I proposed marriage to that heart-enslaver.
I looked about me, and recognised the very portal
where, under a mutual umbrella,&mdash;as it poured with rain,&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
told her of my love. I recollected that, not very far off, in this
same street, lived her father, and mother, and family; and I determined
forthwith to seek them out, and to renew my acquaintance.
I paced along the street, looking upon every house with
uplifted eyes, in the hope of discovering some sign by which I
might recognise it; but the buildings were all so hopelessly
alike that I began to despair of hitting upon the right knocker.
It came to my mind that a lion's head held the knocker, because
I had compared it in former days to the face of the mamma Hogg
herself; but, upon inspecting the knockers, they all had lions'
heads. What was to be done? "I will try what Fate will
do for me," thought I. So, judging that I was somewhere near
the spot, I boldly walked up to a door, and gave a knock
which, I remembered to have been told, indicated a man of
consequence, and, as it turned out, I was not mistaken. The
door was opened, not by a well-dressed servant, as it used to be,
but by an old woman, who was so surprised at seeing my
strange figure that she would have shut it in my face had I not
quickly exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Hogg at home?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hogg!" she exclaimed, in an astonished voice. "Mr.
Hogg has been dead ever so long. Can't you see by the hatchment?"
Upon which she pointed to a painting fixed upon the
outside of the house, which explained to me, what I had never
known before, that, when an Englishman dies, it is the custom
to make a painting, as I supposed, explanatory of the history of
his life; for, afterwards, in contemplating the said performance,
I remarked a boar's head at the top, whilst certain little swine
seemed to be scattered about, evidently indicating the name and
origin of the family.</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Hogg is not dead too?" said I; "where is she,
and Mrs. Figsby?"</p>

<p>"La! sir; you're the Persian prince, I declare," said the
old woman, "of whom we all talk so much about." Upon
which, she immediately undertook to give me a history of the
family since I had left England. The father Hogg, it seems,
had died not many months ago of apoplexy; his widow was
living in a neighbouring street, in a small house, with her eldest
daughter, who was still unmarried. Mrs. Figsby (alas! my
own Bessy!) occupied a handsome house nearly opposite to
the one at the door of which I now stood, and which the old
woman pointed out to me; the youngest daughter had married,
and lived in the country.</p>

<p>Leaving the old woman, I immediately crossed the street,
and knocked at the Figsby gate, not without a certain palpitation
of the heart. It was opened by a brilliantly-dressed servant
in a gaudy <em>kalaat</em>, with a thick paste of white dust upon his
head, and a bunch of ropes as thick as tent-ropes at his shoulder.
Two others stood in the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Figsby at home, by the blessing of the Prophet?"
said I.</p>

<p>He said "Yes," with hesitation, eyeing me well from head to
foot; and, delivering me over to the keeping of another man
without a <em>kalaat</em>, I was walked up stairs. When we came to
the head of the stairs, he stopped, and asked,</p>

<p>"Who shall I say?"</p>

<p>"Mirza Hajji Baba," I answered, recollecting well the whole
ceremonial.</p>

<p>Upon which he opened the door, and exclaimed aloud, as well
as I could understand, "Mister Hatchababy,"&mdash;or some such
name.</p>

<p>"Mister who?" exclaimed a female within, whom, when I entered,
I immediately recognised to be my former love, the moonfaced
Bessy. But, oh! now different from the lovely Bessy I
had known her! Instead of that light cypress-waisted figure
which had charmed me so much, she was now grown into a woman
fat enough to be a Turk's wife. Her cheeks were rounded
into coarse cushions, behind which reposed her almost secluded
eyes. The beautiful throat of former days was scolloped
into graduated ridges; and those arms, which formerly were
lovely by themselves, were now so bound over with broad belts
of golden bracelets, that they looked like the well-fitted hoops
of a wine-cask. The hair, which flowed in ringlets over her
brow and down her cheeks, was now confined to two lumps of
curls, which were placed in a dense cluster on either side of her
forehead; and her whole person, which formerly gave her the
appearance of a Peri, now exhibited a surface agreeable only to
the silk-mercer and the milliner who were called upon to clothe it.</p>

<p>A faint blush threw itself out over her forehead when she
perceived me, and she immediately came forward with her hand
extended, and welcomed me back to her country with great sincerity.
She expressed all sorts of surprises at seeing me, particularly
as I had never been announced in the public newspapers;
assured me that Mr. Figsby, who was not at home,
would be delighted to see me; sent for her children, and exhibited
a vast number to me of all sizes, boys and girls; and
repeated to me what I had just heard from the old woman, the
circumstances in which her family were placed.</p>

<p>I expressed my satisfaction at seeing her so richly circumstanced
in the world, and that she should have made a marriage
with a man who seemed to be a favourite of Fortune, and whose
luck appeared to be ever on the rise. At this she sighed, and
her features assumed a saddened expression.</p>

<p>"'Twas true," she said, "that Figsby could not complain,
and that, as long as it lasted, it was all very well. But, prince!"
she exclaimed, "this is not the country you once knew it to be!
Things are sadly altered! The people have got a reform, 'tis
true; and Figsby is rejoiced, and hopes to be returned for Marylebone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and, who knows whether he may not sit in the cabinet
one of these days? But the aristocracy they won't be quiet, do
what you will, and they will drive us on to a revolution at last,
and oblige us to put them down, and divide all their property
amongst us; and, you know, that will be sad work, particularly
if Figsby should be made a lord before it takes place."</p>

<p>All this was new language to me, and brought to my mind
the conversation which I had heard in the coach. "What
news is this?" thought I, "that women should thus talk the language
of viziers, and mix themselves in the business of state!"</p>

<p>"I thought that Figsby Sahib was a grocer," said I, to
his much-altered wife.</p>

<p>"A grocer, indeed!" said she, with considerable angry emphasis.
"He is a West-India merchant! A grocer, indeed!"</p>

<p>"How long is it," said I, "since he has left his private business
for public life?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know," said she, "the changes which have
taken place since you were here last? Rotten boroughs and
nomination boroughs have been abolished. Schedule A. and
schedule B. have been all the fashion of late; we talk of nothing
else; and there are to be members for Marylebone, and
Figsby is canvassing as hard as he can; and I am sure, prince,
if you can help him with a vote, you will."</p>

<p>"A vote!" said I, "what does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means," she answered, with some hesitation, "that you
wish Figsby may become a member of parliament, and sit in the
house, and make speeches, and give franks, and all that."</p>

<p>"If it is only to wish your husband may be all you desire,"
said I, "in the name of the Imams you shall have my vote, and
welcome."</p>

<p>"That's right!" said Bessy; "that's right! that's being an
old friend in truth. I knew that you would be on the right
side, and stick up for the people."</p>

<p>"But who is the people? is he a new Shah, or what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the people!" said she; "the people! they are the
sovereign people! They are all the men and women you see
walking about; they want their rights&mdash;their rights&mdash;that's
all!"</p>

<p>"All the men and women walking about!" exclaimed I.
"What news is this? They have got a king already. What
do they want more?"</p>

<p>"They have, 'tis true," said she; "but what is that without
their rights?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean about their rights," said I;
"but we have a Shah, and I know that if any Persian wanted
anything more, and talked about his rights, all that he would
get for his pains would be the <em>felek</em>&mdash;a good bastinado on the
soles of his feet; that's what he would get."</p>

<p>"Oh, la!" said Mrs. Figsby, "that may do for Persians, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
it won't do for Englishmen. They must be fairly represented;
and, if such men as Figsby are not elected, it is a great shame,
and the country will go to rack and ruin."</p>

<p>At this stage of our conversation a knocking at the door
was heard, and soon after entered the moonfaced Bessy's husband.
I immediately recognised my former rival, but great
changes had taken place in his person also. In former days he
was happy to be allowed to take the lowermost place in the
<em>mejlis</em> or assembly; now he walked in with an air of consequence
and protection. He came into the room with a noise and bustle;
his boots creaked most independently; he was all over chains;
and seemed strangled from the tightness of his clothes. He soon
got over his surprise at seeing me; and, before he had done
shaking my hand, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"All is going as it ought to be! I have been at the
meeting. I made such a speech, Bessy, you would have been
quite charmed. There is no doubt of my coming in. We
shall beat the Tories hollow."</p>

<p>"That is charming!" said his overjoyed wife. "Then you
will be an M.P., and who knows what else! And here is
the prince," said she, "who is ready to give you his vote."</p>

<p>"That's right!" said the entranced grocer. "That's very
kind of him! But stop! let me see; are you a ten-pound
householder? is your name stuck up against the church-door?
and have you paid your shilling?"</p>

<p>"<em>Allah! Allah!</em>" I exclaimed. "What do I know of all
this? I am nothing but a Persian Mirza. I am ignorant of
your ten-pounds, your church-doors, and your shillings. Do
leave off this child's play, and let us talk of other things."</p>

<p>"Other things!" cried one.</p>

<p>"Child's play!" exclaimed the other.</p>

<p>"It is the only thing now thought of," said the man.</p>

<p>"It is of the greatest consequence to the state, and to Marylebone,
that Figsby should be elected!" vociferated the lady.</p>

<p>I found that I had put my unlucky leg foremost on this occasion,
and so I thought of making my retreat; but, before I did
so, after having observed a look of recognition between husband
and wife, Mr. Figsby stept up to me, and said,</p>

<p>"We shall have a few of my political friends to dine with me
in a few days; I hope, prince, that we may be honoured with
your company?"</p>

<p>I said, "<em>Inshallah!</em> please Allah!" and then returned to my
home.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p>I returned to my lodging full of thought. What with the
conversations I had heard in the coach, what with the strange
sayings of Mrs. Figsby and her husband, I began to have
my eyes a little more opened than they were before. I considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
that, notwithstanding the flourishing exterior of things,
and the general appearances of prosperity which had struck my
eyes, there might be truth in the rumours which had been so
current in Persia, that England was declining fast in greatness,
and was on the brink of ruin. I had occasionally seen
madmen in my own country, from whose brain all sense had
fled when their minds were bent upon a particular subject,
but who still upon others were rational, and acted like sane
men. "May not that be the case here?" thought I; "and, if
all the nation has run mad by one common consent upon this
desire of change, they may have sapped the foundation of their
real happiness and prosperity, although they still build fine
houses and exhibit resplendent shops."</p>

<p>I determined, in conformity to my instructions from the
asylum of the universe, to present my letters to the English
vizier; to have a conversation with him, and then to settle whether
I should deliver the fortunate letter, of which I was the
bearer, from the king of kings to the King of England. Accordingly,
I proceeded to a certain dark and obscure street, where,
on former occasions, I recollected the sovereign had ordered his
vizier to receive the ambassadors and ministers of foreign
powers, and there to transact their business, and, sure enough,
I found things just as I had left them; thus far there had
been no reform. I found no parade of guards, executioners,
officers, or heralds; but one little man seated in a great leather
chair, and through his interference I was introduced into a
dark room, without a single word of welcome being said, not
even "Good morning," and "Fine day;" and there I was left
until the vizier could speak to me.</p>

<p>I waited what appeared to me a long time,&mdash;quite long enough
to consider, if this was an English palace, what must be an
English prison! At length another infidel invited me to follow
him, and, after having been paraded through a few rooms,
I found myself in the presence of one whom I first took for the
vizier, but who I soon found was only his deputy. He was very
kind and civil, and asked my business in courteous language;
upon which I told him that I was just arrived from the foot of
the Persian throne, and was the bearer of a letter to the English
vizier, as well as to his royal master. He seemed pleased at
this information; but he asked me a question which made the
wind fly out of my head.</p>

<p>"Pray, sir," said he, "do you bring us any letter from
our minister in Persia? I do not think that we have been
apprised of your mission."</p>

<p>Upon this I stroked down my beard, and, searching in the
depths of my wit for a ready answer, I answered that I was
despatched from the imperial stirrup as a courier, and not as a
minister. "I have no letter but this;" upon which I drew from
my breast the grand vizier's letter, which I delivered into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
hand. He was at a loss whilst he unrolled it, for he evidently
did not know the top from the bottom; and all communication
must have ceased between us, had I not possessed
the translation, which I had prudently caused to be made at
Tabriz by one of my own countrymen who had received his
education in England.</p>

<p>This, the vizier's deputy read over very attentively; and, as he
read, I observed certain smiles break out on his features, from
which I augured favourably. He then desired me to wait, whilst
he took up the papers, and left the room to lay them before his
chief, saying not a word of his own opinion upon their contents.</p>

<p>He soon returned, and, asking me to follow, he led the way
into an adjacent room, where I found the English vizier in
person. The appearance and manners of this personage were
full of charm; and, although a man in his high office had
usually the power of awing me into fear and diffidence of
myself, still I felt no other sensations than what were agreeable
when he addressed me.</p>

<p>"I have been reading strange things in this letter," said the
vizier. "I am informed that my country is on the brink of
ruin, and that his majesty the Shah, apprehending disaster
might accrue to my own sovereign, has been pleased to offer
him an asylum at his gate."</p>

<p>"That is, in truth, the object of my mission," said I. "You
have spoken right."</p>

<p>"But how," said the vizier, "has this information travelled
to Persia? It is new to me, as it is, I believe, to every member
of his majesty's government."</p>

<p>"How do I know?" I answered, with some little confusion;
for, in truth, I began to feel that I had come upon a fool's
errand, and was about to swallow much abomination. "Our
news in Persia is not printed every day upon paper as it is
here, but comes to us as it may please the will of Allah!
The asylum of the universe, upon whom be blessings! who
knows all, and does all for the good of his subjects, was convinced
of the fact; the same was confirmed by all strangers
arriving at his imperial gate; and it was announced by the
English minister himself that a great change was about to
take place in his country; that old counsels, which had been
followed since the recollection of the most ancient greybeards of
the country, were about to be abolished and replaced by new;
and that a certain thing, called People, whether man or beast
we never could discover, was on the point of obtaining supremacy,
and despoiling your reverend monarch, for whom the
king of kings entertains the highest friendship, of his ancient
hereditary throne."</p>

<p>"Your news," observed the vizier, "was partly right, and
partly false. That a change has taken place in the government
of this country," said he, "is true; and our minister's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
words are confirmed. A change has taken place; but change
does not argue total destruction."</p>

<p>Recollecting that I was here at the fountain-head of information,
and that the vizier's words were words to be repeated
to the king of kings, I inquired, "As I am less than
the least, may it please you to inform your slave what is this
change?"</p>

<p>"The principal change has been in giving the people a better
means than they had before of making their wishes known
through their representatives. You know, of course," said he,
"what our 'parliament' means?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "I believe I am right in saying that a
representative means a man who is supposed to be a concentrated
essence of the thousands and tens of thousands of those
who choose him; and that he cries out 'black' or 'white' as
the fit seizes him. A collection of such men means a parliament."</p>

<p>"You have a tolerable notion of what I mean," said the
vizier, smiling. "Now, certain of these representatives could
only cry out 'black' or 'white' as it choosed to please, not
themselves, but certain khans or omrahs of our country, who
sent them instead of the people. That is the principal change
we have made."</p>

<p>"I understand&mdash;I understand!" I exclaimed, as if a new
light had opened upon me. "The omrahs, therefore, are displeased,
and cry out 'Ruin!' and the people are overjoyed, and
cry out, 'We are sovereigns;' and both are wrong."</p>

<p>The vizier seemed greatly amused with my great discovery,
and then entered into certain long explanations concerning the
various topics which I had heard discussed between the smooth
and rough infidels whom I had met in the coach, and which
only tended to obscure the great conclusion to which I had
come by the light of my own wit. I allowed him to talk, and
he seemed pleased to do so, as if he were defending himself from
imputations, and of which, in truth, I understood not one word.
However, he seemed amazingly struck, when, in rising to go, I
said,</p>

<p>"It is plain, then, that some great mistake has been committed
somewhere; otherwise, why should this great country
be so terribly torn from one end of it to the other by
animosities, which seem to have led it to the brink of anarchy?"</p>

<p>"No great change," said he, "can take place without producing
a great shock of interests and opinions, and consequently
animosities."</p>

<p>"And that is just what a good and wise government ought to
avoid," said I. "Our Shah is called <em>Zil Allah</em>, the Shadow of
the Almighty; and, according to the saying of one of our ancient
sages, the acts of a king ought to follow the same course
perceivable in the dispensations of Providence, and in the laws by
which God, the great and good, directs the fates of his creatures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
All changes in government ought to be as gradual as changes in
the seasons. If a great change takes place without a previous
preparation of the people's minds, and an almost imperceptible
one in their habits, of course the sudden transition will
produce a shock so violent, that the mischief may perhaps be
without remedy. If, during the heats of summer, the Almighty
were to give this globe a sudden accelerated turn, and throw us
at once into the snows of winter, the effects might almost produce
sudden death upon one half of his creatures; but he
allows the intervening autumn gradually to blend the two extremes,
and thus produces a healthy action in the operations of
nature."</p>

<p>He did not seem so much struck by the wisdom of this speech
as I was, and I was about leaving him, when I recollected
the letter with which I was charged from the <em>Shah-en-Shah</em>,
the king of kings, and asked when I should deliver it. He
paused a little in thought, and then said,</p>

<p>"Perhaps it may be as well that we hear something from our
minister in Persia before you deliver your letter." Upon
which, seeing that my countenance was turned upside down,
he said, with great kindness of manner, "There will be no
harm done if you deliver it immediately. The King of England
is ready to receive the application of every one, from the peasant
in the field to the greatest potentate."</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="WHY_THE_WIND_BLOWS_ROUND_ST_PAULS" id="WHY_THE_WIND_BLOWS_ROUND_ST_PAULS"></a>WHY THE WIND BLOWS ROUND ST. PAUL'S.</h2>

<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY JOYCE JOCUND.</p>


<p>Whoever has walked round St. Paul's church-yard must have had
good evidence of the wind being always boisterous there, on the most
balmy day of spring, in summer's more sultry hour, in autumn's bracing
time, or in winter's chilling air; all tides and every season bear strong
testimony that the wind is ever blowing there, not in those gentle
gales that love to play and wanton round other edifices, but in such
rude, boisterous burstings, that the traveller is fain to look to his footing,
and put up with a <em>blow</em> which is neither to be parried nor returned.
I cannot fix the precise date, but it was during the last century,
that a bit of a breeze was kicked up in the higher circles among the
Winds; and, from the strife that ensued, more serious consequences
seemed to threaten than were at first apprehended. Whether the
East was intent on going westward, or the North determined on veering
to the south, is of trifling import. From words the disputants
nearly came to blows, and the weathercocks were sadly put to their
shifts during all the changes that occurred: those who consulted
them found how little attention was paid to the cardinal points,
which from time immemorial had been considered their cardinal virtues;
in short, it was impossible to tell which way the wind lay. Nothing
was to be heard among them but wranglings, wailings, and
contentions.</p>

<p>"As for you," roared old Boreas, addressing a mild-looking individual
personifying the South wind, "a poor, soft, effeminate creature,
only fit to breathe o'er a bed of violets, what, in the name of all that's
trifling, can you possibly presume to know?"</p>

<p>"I may not be so bluff as you, nor so excellent a bully," replied
the other; "yet I flatter myself that I am equally esteemed by mankind."</p>

<p>"Doubtless! by old maids, invalids, and anglers."</p>

<p>"And I prefer their welcome to the maledictions so lavishly heaped
upon you, by the aged, the gouty, and the suffering," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Fie! fie!" lisped the West wind, an exquisite of the most exclusive
order. "If you persist, I shall positively arraign you at the bar
of good breeding and fashion."</p>

<p>"Which I believe is not situated on <em>my</em> side Temple-bar," exclaimed
the East, in a tone that reminded one of the equinox.</p>

<p>"Your intimacy with the bar is confined to the Old Bailey," chirruped
his opponent, who commenced,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Cease rude Boreas, blustering railer:</div>
<div class="verse">List ye."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At this personal attack the North looked particularly black, and
the East <span class="smcap">BLEW</span> with increased violence.</p>

<p>"How the puppy squalls!" said the latter, in reference to the
singing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather more melodious than your howling," replied the tormentor;
for the West wind is occasionally pretty sharp when its powers
are exerted.</p>

<p>With this slight specimen you may suppose that the Winds began
to get very high; ill-natured replies followed angry remarks; while
the East wind distributed his usual cutting retorts with unsparing
profusion. In short, the only subject on which they appeared agreed
was to perform "The Storm," <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>, with hail and rain accompaniments.
There is an old adage, "as busy as the Devil in a
high wind:" how busy that may be, let others determine; but truly
his Satanic Majesty was never more occupied than on this memorable
occasion, for he seemed to have possessed the contending parties
with an implacable spirit of opposition, and contrived to divide his influence
so impartially that each played the very devil with the other.
When the uproar had sufficiently subsided to permit observation, it
was clearly apparent that the North, as was his wont, rather sided
with the East, and the South as plainly inclined to the West; so,
after amusing himself with their differences, the crafty instigator of the
feud proposed that the affair should be permitted to blow over, and,
by way of cooling themselves, that the four Winds should accompany
him on a stroll through London streets, towards the City; where he
promised them plenty of adventures, with many sights worthy their
attention. After a few more gusts of passion exhibited by the North
and East, venting their spite upon their more peaceful opponents,
the party set forth on their ramble, with something like outward decency
of demeanour, although opposition and dissatisfaction were
rankling in their hearts. Their cicerone pointed to a plot of ground
in Hyde Park.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, "will be erected an imperishable monument to
that greatest of modern heroes, the victor of a hundred fights. In
every land shall his matchless deeds be known, and his fame proclaimed
by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The four Winds!" exclaimed they all.</p>

<p>"Yonder will be his town-residence," resumed their guide, "the
scarcely less than princely mansion of the nation's idol; yet, so
evanescent is popularity, and so great is the distinction between civil
matters and military, that coming years will display his windows
barricaded against the assaults of that people whose opinions are as
changeable as the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" said his hearers in a breath, ready to take offence
should he indulge in any <em>personal</em> allusion.</p>

<p>"As changeable as&mdash;as the weather."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the East, with a significant whistle, that sounded
very like the blast of a war-trumpet.</p>

<p>They walked some distance without further remark, until reaching
Pall-Mall.</p>

<p>"This," said the Devil, directing their attention to a range of
buildings on the right, "this will ere long disappear. Of yon regal
habitation, the scene of revelry and delight, not a vestige will remain;
vast local improvements will be completed, magnificent residences
erected; and here a lofty column shall be raised, on whose 'tall pillar,
pointing to the skies,' will be placed the statue of a princely commander&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who will doubtless be <em>highly indebted</em> to the people," observed
the North, in his most unpleasant manner.</p>

<p>"And what may be that heavy-looking temple opposite?" inquired
the East, pointing to the Opera-house.</p>

<p>"That is celebrated as the resort of beauty, rank, wealth, and
fashion."</p>

<p>Here the West wind nodded his assent, as if perfectly cognisant of
affairs so particularly appertaining to <em>his</em> quarter of the metropolis.</p>

<p>"Where the aristocracy of this kingdom assemble to lavish their
wealth and favours on foreign <em>artistes</em>, as they are called, while native
industry and talent are neglected and unrequited. But my sentimentality
outruns my prudence; <em>I</em> patronise the Opera, notwithstanding,"
said the Devil.</p>

<p>"And I," said the West.</p>

<p>Continuing their perambulation, they reached the present site of
Waterloo-bridge.</p>

<p>"A splendid structure," observed their conductor, "will here span
that mighty stream, on whose waves float a thousand argosies
freighted with riches from every distant land. Speculation will soon
furnish means sufficient for the enterprise, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The profits?" inquired old Boreas, too far <em>north</em> to lose sight of
the main chance.</p>

<p>"Will be shared among the subscribers."</p>

<p>"By what rule?"</p>

<p>"<em>Short</em> division," was the answer.</p>

<p>"This building on the right is Somerset House, where the Royal
Academy holds its annual exhibition of British artists, at which persons
pay a shilling to view their own portraits that have cost most
exorbitant sums, if painted by popular professors of the art."</p>

<p>"A noble institution," said the South, in simplicity of soul, "and
most encouraging to rising talent."</p>

<p>"Very," was the devilish dry reply.</p>

<p>"And where young exhibitors have fine opportunities afforded
them to profit by the experience, skill, and fostering care of their superiors."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the Devil, with a malicious smile. "In the arrangement
and distribution of the pictures the committee show an
intimate knowledge of 'light and shade,' which is particularly instructive
to others. They appropriate all the 'light' to their own pictures,
and the 'shade' to their neighbours'. Yonder dirty-looking gate
is Temple-bar, where in the olden time traitors' heads stood in goodly
row, as plentiful as the portraits in the Exhibition, only that the 'bodies'
never came to own them. But"&mdash;and here the Devil sighed like a
furnace&mdash;"innovation and improvement have destroyed all venerable
customs."</p>

<p>So, venting his regrets, they journeyed down Fleet-street, when
the attention of the gentle South was attracted to the large gloomy
edifice which is so prominent in that locality.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said their guide, "that is the Fleet."</p>

<p>"Where?" said the East, springing up at the idea of stiff breezes
and swelling sails; "I see no ships."</p>

<p>"Yet there is no lack of <em>craft</em>, I promise you," replied the Devil.
"One of the considerate laws of this realm declares that a debtor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
shall pay in person what he is deficient in pocket: a sapient method
to man his Majesty's <em>fleet</em>, and as pretty a piece of legislation as <em>I</em>
would propose."</p>

<p>Turning from the prison and its solid-looking brickwork, the first
glimpse of St. Paul's met their astonished gaze. The strangers were
enraptured at that mighty monument of man's power and perseverance.
After surveying the exterior, the Winds expressed an eagerness
to view the inside of the cathedral; but their importunities were
negatived by their companion, who intimated in strong terms his
repugnance to such a proposition. "Besides," he observed, "which
of you will pay the twopences demanded for admission? By-the-bye,
do me the favour to wait here a few moments. Some most intimate
and particular friends are now assembled at the Chapter Coffee-house."</p>

<p>"Do not let us detain you unwillingly," growled the North.</p>

<p>"We are much indebted for your care and guidance," murmured
the South.</p>

<p>"I feel more at home in my own quarter of the town," said the
East; "let me prove no hindrance."</p>

<p>"But promise me to remain,&mdash;rely upon my speedy return," said
the Devil.</p>

<p>"Agreed!" roared the North, who seemed to think the spot a good
place to make himself heard.</p>

<p>"Then I depend upon your awaiting my coming. For the present,
farewell!"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir!</i>" lisped the West, as the arch deceiver disappeared
down one of the narrow avenues which abound in that locality.</p>

<p>Well, the poor Winds went whistling up and down, looking at the
shops, watching the crowd, and amusing themselves as best they
could under such disagreeable circumstances. They made several
rounds of the church, the hands of the clock made several rounds of
the dial, yet the absent one appeared not; and their patience was
nearly exhausted, when the South modestly offered to sing them a
song, if indeed such feeble powers could lighten the time and lessen
their suspense, and then breathed the following words to a soft plaintive
<em>air</em>:</p>


<p class="center b f90 space-above2">SONG OF THE SOUTH.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi8">I.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I love to roam where the spice-groves send</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Their mingled sweets o'er the fragrant air,</div>
<div class="verse">Where orange-blossoms their bright buds lend</div>
<div class="verse vi2">To weave a wreath for the blushing fair;</div>
<div class="verse">And I waft each shining tress aside</div>
<div class="verse">That shades the brow of the blooming bride.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi8">II.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I love to roam at the sunset hour,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">To breathe farewell to the parting day,</div>
<div class="verse">And kiss the dew from each star-lit flower,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">That ever weeps as light fades away.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! I woo them all with my softest sighs,</div>
<div class="verse">And gently whisper,&mdash;that Love never dies!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p class="space-above1">"Enough! enough!" grumbled the East; "I cannot waste my
time in such frivolities. Where is the fellow who brought us here?"</p>

<p>"Ay!" said the North, "does he fancy we have nothing better to
occupy us than attending his pleasure, dancing attendance?"</p>

<p>And thereat the watchers became mighty impatient. At length
the North declared that he had business of great importance that
night upon the coast.</p>

<p>"What fools we were to pledge ourselves! My engagements are
imperative,&mdash;go I must!" roared he with vehemence.</p>

<p>"And I," added the East, with similar violence.</p>

<p>"I have made an appointment in Bond-street," muttered the West,
mentioning the fashionable lounge of that period; "moreover, the
Countess of B&mdash;&mdash; expects me at her party. I am irrevocably bound
to the countess, and would not disappoint the sweet creature for
worlds."</p>

<p>"I cannot remain alone in this gloomy place," sighed the South.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said the North, puffing himself up to an unusual pomposity,
even for him; "I have a plan to remedy the dilemma. I go,&mdash;that
is settled. You three can easily find an excuse for my absence."</p>

<p>"And mine," cried the East. "Two are very good company,&mdash;three
damp conversation."</p>

<p>"As I have nothing particular to communicate, I shall follow your
example," said the West, looking significantly at the East.</p>

<p>"I was assured the puppy would oppose me," grunted the latter;
"'tis his constant practice."</p>

<p>Thus affairs appeared in tolerable train for a repetition of the
former bickering, when it was at last decided, but not without much
turbulent and acrimonious feeling, that each should wait in turn, and
give timely notice to the others of the truant's arrival; and with this
understanding they separated, leaving one on guard. It is hardly necessary
to state that the Devil never reappeared. He always leaves
his votaries in the lurch; and on this occasion his boon companions at
the Chapter gave him such good cheer, that he forgot the poor
winds, who have ever since been alternately looking, but in vain, for
his arrival. To their honour be it told, that they each and every one
performed his promise of remaining for a stated period, neither excepting
the boisterous North, the cutting East, the fashionable West,
nor the gentle South. Their various watchings may be easily distinguished
by their respective degrees of violence in the neighbourhood,
and to this very hour is one of them to be heard either roaring,
blowing, moaning, or sighing for their emancipation. And this accounts
for the fact of their constant presence, and shows why "<span class="smcap">the
wind blows round St. Paul's</span>."</p>

<p>The tradition inculcates a moral. Had the four Winds pursued the
"path of duty," this trial had been spared them; but they listened to
the tempter. Let all profit by their example: Men, as well as Winds,
should "<span class="smcap">keep within compass</span>."</p>

<div class="verse">An artist&mdash;'tis not fair to tell his name;</div>
<div class="verse vi2">But one whom Fortune, in her freakish tricks,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Saluted with less smiles than kicks,</div>
<div class="verse">More to the painter's honour, and her shame,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Was one day deep engaged on his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">(A painting worthy of the Louvre,)</div>
<div class="verse">Dives and Lazarus the theme,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The subject was his earliest boyish dream!</div>
<div class="verse">And, with an eye to colour, breadth, and tone,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">He painted, skilfully as he was able,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">The good things on the rich man's table,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Wishing they were, no doubt, upon his own;</div>
<div class="verse">When suddenly his hostess&mdash;best of creatures!&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Made visible her features,</div>
<div class="verse">And to this world our artist did awaken:</div>
<div class="verse vi2">"A gentleman," she said, "from the next street,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Had sent a special message in a heat,</div>
<div class="verse">Wanting a likeness taken."</div>
<div class="verse">The artist, with a calmness oft the effect</div>
<div class="verse">Of tidings which we don't expect,</div>
<div class="verse">Wip'd all his brushes carefully and clean,</div>
<div class="verse">Button'd his coat&mdash;a coat which once had been,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Put on his hat, and with uncommon stress</div>
<div class="verse">On the address,</div>
<div class="verse">Went forth, revolving in his nob</div>
<div class="verse">How his kind hostess, when he'd got the job,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Even before they paid him for his skill,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Would let him add a little to the bill.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He found a family of six or seven,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">All grown-up people, seated in a row;</div>
<div class="verse">There might be seen upon each face a leaven</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Of recent, and of decent woe,</div>
<div class="verse">But that the artist, whose chief cares</div>

<div class="verse">Gazed, with a business eye, to be acquainted</div>
<div class="verse">Which of the seven wanted to be painted.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But a young lady soon our artist greeted,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, in words of gentlest music, "Ah!&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Pray, Mr. Thingo'me, be seated,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">We want a likeness of our grandpapa."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Such chances Fortune seldom deigns to bring:</div>
<div class="verse">The very thing!</div>
<div class="verse">How he should like</div>
<div class="verse">To emulate Vandyke!</div>
<div class="verse">Or, rather&mdash;still more glorious ambition&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">To paint the head like Titian,</div>
<div class="verse">A fine old head, with silver sprinkled:</div>
<div class="verse">A face all seam'd and wrinkled:&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The painter's heart 'gan inwardly rejoice;</div>
<div class="verse vi2">But, as he pondered on that "fine old head,"</div>
<div class="verse">Another utter'd, in a mournful voice,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The artist was perplex'd&mdash;the case was alter'd:</div>

<div class="verse vi2">"But, surely, you can let me see the corpse?</div>
<div class="verse">An artist but requires a hint:</div>
<div class="verse">There are the features&mdash;give the cheeks a tint&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Paint in the eyes&mdash;and, though the task's a hard 'un,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">You'll find the thing, I'll swear,</div>
<div class="verse">As like as he can,&mdash;no, I beg your pardon,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse vi2">As like as he <em>could</em> stare!"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Alas! alas!" the eldest sister sigh'd,</div>

<div class="verse">So that 'twas long ere she again could speak,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">"We buried him last week!"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The painter heaved a groan: "But, surely, madam,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">You have a likeness of the dear deceased;</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Some youthful face, whose age might be increased?"</div>
<div class="verse">"No, no,&mdash;we haven't, sir, no more than Adam;</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Not in the least!"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This was the strangest thing that e'er occurr'd;&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse vi2">"You'll pardon me," the baffled painter cried;</div>
<div class="verse">"But, really, I must say, upon my word,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">You might have sent for me before he died."</div>
<div class="verse">And then he turn'd to the surviving tribe,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">"Can you describe</div>
<div class="verse">But a few items, features, shape, and hue?</div>
<div class="verse">I'll warrant, I'll still paint the likeness true!"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Why, yes, we could do that," said one: "let's see;</div>
<div class="verse">He had a rather longish nose, like me."</div>
<div class="verse">"No," said a second; "there you're wrong,</div>
<div class="verse">His nose was not so very long."</div>
<div class="verse">"Well, well," pursued the first; "his eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Were rather smaller than the common size."</div>
<div class="verse">"How?" cried a third, "how?&mdash;not at all;</div>
<div class="verse">Not small&mdash;not small!"</div>
<div class="verse">"Well, then, an oval face, extremely fine."</div>
<div class="verse">"Yes," said the eldest son, "like mine."</div>
<div class="verse">The painter gazed upon him in despair,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The fellow's face was square!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"I have it," cried another, and arose;</div>
<div class="verse">"But wait a moment, sir," and out she goes.</div>
<div class="verse">With curiosity the artist burn'd&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">"What was she gone for?" but she soon return'd.</div>
<div class="verse">"I knew from what <em>they</em> said, to expect to gain</div>
<div class="verse">A likeness of grandpa was quite in vain;</div>
<div class="verse">But, not upon that point to dwell,</div>
<div class="verse">I have got something here will do as well</div>

<p>There glides the dashing Spankaway over the smooth surface of
the ocean, whilst, close in her wake, moves the vanquished Hippolito.
The damages have been repaired so as to be scarcely perceptible; the
shot-holes have been well plugged and secured; and the two frigates
appear more like consorts on a cruise than enemies so recently engaged
in deadly strife. The breeze is a royal breeze; and gallantly
the beautiful ships are splitting the yielding waters, whilst the watches
are employed in necessary duties. Near the taffrail of the Spankaway
stand two prominent figures, both remarkably fine-looking men,
who might be taken for brother officers but for the difference in their
uniforms. The one on the larboard hand has his head erect, his
chest thrown forward, his left hand thrust into his waistcoat, and his
right foot in advance planted firmly on the deck; he is indulging in
high-wrought and proud feelings as he silently gazes on the prize;
his voice is not heard, but there is a speaking meaning in his look as
he contemplates the red cross of St. George upon a white field floating
majestically above the tricolour, whilst his own untarnished ensign
waves singly at his peak. The individual on the starboard hand
has a cast of melancholy on his countenance; his head is depressed,
his arms are folded on his breast; and, though sensible that he has
done his duty, and defended his command as long as his crew rendered
it tenable, yet he knows that he was not well supported by his fellow-citizens,
among whom equality is the order of the day; and he is
suffering from a sense of deep humiliation at the degraded condition
in which he is placed. These are the captains of the two frigates,&mdash;the
victor and the vanquished.</p>

<p>Upon the quarter-deck of the Hippolito is Mr. Seymour, hurrying
to and fro, issuing his orders, and rendering the prize as effective as
possible. There is a laughing glee upon his features that plainly evidences
the pleasure he cherishes in his heart; he looks around with
exaltation as he anticipates the moment when he himself shall have
such a desirable command. One step he makes sure of; a few hours
more may perform fresh wonders; and his mind, with all the vividness
of a seaman's hope, is making a hop, skip, and a jump progress to
certain conclusions favourable to promotion. The fact is, Seymour
had been long neglected; he was an excellent officer, and a brave
man; had fought in several actions, been severely wounded on more
than one occasion; but the coveted distinction had been withheld because
he was not a first lieutenant. Now, however, he made sure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
it; and he already began to feel the weight of the epaulette on the
left shoulder, with an ardent determination to do something that
would transfer it to the right shoulder.</p>

<p>But whither are the frigates steering? their heads are not on the
compass-point for a friendly port, but directly the reverse. Night is
coming on; they are running into the gulf of Genoa. There are the
Hieres, a little open on the larboard bow, just rising from the sea.
South-west should carry them to Gibraltar, and there are they going
away north-east.</p>

<p>"Your undertaking is rather hazardous, my lord," said Citizen
Captain Begaud; "there are ships of the line in the immediate
neighbourhood, and the English fleet may have again resumed its
station."</p>

<p>"If the latter is the case," replied Lord Eustace, "I can run no
hazard; for Lord Nelson will have a bright eye upon the enemy. On
the other hand, the enterprise is worth a little risk; and, though I
despise the fellows who gave me the information, yet it is my duty,
as well as according with my inclination, to make the most of it."</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous avez raison, milord</i>," rejoined the Frenchman; "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mais</i>&mdash;" he
paused: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sacré!</i> the rascal who told you merits the guillotine; he is
a disgrace to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande nation</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blow'd if I can make any thing o' this here!" exclaimed
old Savage, the boatswain, to his subordinate, Jack Sheavehole,
as they stood upon the forecastle; "it beats my larning out and out.
Here we captures a French frigate, and has all the prisoners in limbo,
when, instead of seeing her into a place of safety, why here we goes
happy-go-lucky right down into the bight of Ginoar, slap into the
enemy's teeth."</p>

<p>"Is that why you calls it a bite, Mr. Savage?" asked Jemmy
Ducks, touching his hat with all due respect.</p>

<p>"Calls what a bite, you egg-sucker?" responded the boatswain
somewhat roughly, at the presumption of the inquirer in addressing
an officer of his distinction so freely. "Calls what a bite?"</p>

<p>"Going into the enemy's teeth, sir!" answered the humble poulterer,
again touching his straw covering.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear such an hignoramus, Jack?" said the boatswain
to his veteran mate, in a tone of extreme contempt.</p>

<p>"Why, for the matter o' that, not often, sir," answered the individual
addressed, "thof it is but nat'ral for him;" and, seeing that
the boatswain was twiddling his rattan with his fingers, as a prelude
to castigation, he turned to the poulterer, and, giving him a friendly
shove, exclaimed, "Away out o' that, Jemmy; there's the cow's babby
bleating for you;" and off he went.</p>

<p>"The sarvice is going to &mdash;&mdash;, Jack!" said Mr. Savage; "the captain
arn't half strict enough with them there 'long-shore lubbers, as
pay no more respect to an officer than they do to a timber-head! and,
in the regard o' that, his lordship himself too often speaks to 'em as
if they had flesh and blood like his own, when, Lord love you! they
arn't got never no such thing. And where his lordship is bound to
now, puzzles my calculations. I say, Muster Blueblazes," to the gunner,
who approached them, "what's all this here about?"</p>

<p>"Flannel cartridges," replied the gunner, passing on in a hurry,
and calling to his several mates to descend to the magazine.</p>

<p>"Flannel devils!" retorted old Savage. "That's all the answer I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
gets for my pains! Pray, Muster Nugent, may I presume to ax you
if you can just deligthning my mind as to what cruise we're going on
in this course, seeing as it takes us slap down into the bight of the
bay?"</p>

<p>"Gulf, Mr. Savage,&mdash;not bay," replied the junior lieutenant, "the
gulf of Genoa, named after a celebrated city that formerly monopolised
the commerce of the world. Christopher Columbus was a Genoese.
Did you never read about Christopher Columbus?"</p>

<p>"Can't say as I have, sir," returned the impatient boatswain; "are
we bound in chase of him, sir?"</p>

<p>"In chase of whom? Columbus?" responded the lieutenant, laughing;
"why, he's been dead nearly two hundred years. No, no, Mr.
Savage; we're going&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Nugent!" shouted Lord Eustace from the quarter-deck;
and, to the great vexation of the boatswain, who was on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui-vive</i>
to ascertain where they were bound, the young officer instantly responded,
and went aft.</p>

<p>"That's just the way I'm al'ays sarved," said Savage petulantly,
and applying his rattan to the shoulders of a poor unfortunate lad who
passed him without touching the locks that hung clustering on his
forehead,&mdash;for hat or cap he had none. "Here's a pretty know-nothing!
Do you forget, sir, that an officer's an officer, sir? and
it's customary, sir, to pay proper respect, sir, to your superiors, sir,
your betters, sir, you scape-grace, lubberly blackguard, sir;" and
down came the stick at every "sir." The boy made the best of his
way across the forecastle; but was again stopped by the boatswain.
"Come back here, you wagabone. Don't you know, sir, that it's a
great mark of disrespect, sir, to run away when an officer's starting
you, sir? There, go along, you useless lumber! pretty regylations
we shall have by and by, when such hard bargains as you fall aboard
the King's biscuit! We're all going to the devil together, Jack!"
and he turned to look over the bows.</p>

<p>"If we are going to the devil," muttered Jack to the captain of the
forecastle, "I hopes he'll sarve out his infarnal favours as the Lords
of the Admiralty shares the prize-money,&mdash;three parts among the
officers."</p>

<p>Lovely is a Mediterranean twilight in those balmy months that
breathe the odorous incense of exulting Nature in all its richest perfumes!
then is the hour for contemplation! it is then the mind
ranges over its best affections; and hearts, though oceans divide them,
hold a mysterious communing with each other.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Deeper, oh twilight, let thy shades increase</div>
<div class="verse">Till every feeling, every pulse, is peace."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is the poet alone that can describe its influences, for the art
of the painter is baffled; he cannot produce the deepening tints as
the web of darkness appears to be progressively weaving over the face
of the heavens.</p>

<p>"I love this season," said Lord Eustace to his captive, as they still
stood side by side abaft; "there is a holy tranquillity about it that
calms every turbulent passion, and soothes the heart in its sorrow."</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est vrai, milord</i>," returned the Frenchman, mournfully enough
for one of his country; "and yon star there," pointing to Algol in Medusa's
head, "has ever been to me the star of my destiny. Three
days since I quitted Toulon; that orb at night was dim, and a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
foreboding rested on my spirit; on the following night its brightness,
even its dimensions, had decreased, and then I knew the doom of my
honour was at hand."</p>

<p>"Whatever presentiment you might have had," said Lord Eustace,
"rest satisfied your honour remains untarnished. You fought your
ship well, and be assured my account of the action shall do you ample
justice. But I should like to know why you consider that particular
star as connected with your fortunes."</p>

<p>"You shall be gratified then," responded the Frenchman, "if you
have no objections to a tale of horror."</p>

<p>"None, none,&mdash;not in the least!" answered the noble captain;
"the hour, the quiet, the dubious light, it is just the time for such
a thing. Pray favour me, and I will gaze on the Gorgon, and listen
with profound attention."</p>

<p>"We are both of us young, my lord," commenced the Frenchman;
"I am but six-and-twenty, and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One year your junior, Monsieur Capitaine," uttered his lordship;
"but I fancy I have seen more active service than you?"</p>

<p>"Afloat, 'tis probable, my lord," rejoined Begaud. "I was not at
first destined for the marine: my early career was in the army of the
North, when your Duke of York, deserted by the allied powers, (who
received your money whilst they negotiated with the Directory,) retreated
before our victorious troops. But I am forestalling my narrative,&mdash;heaving
ahead of my reckoning, I think you'd call it. I am
by birth a native of Paris, and the night of my entering the world was
one of wailing, lamentation, and death. It was that on which three
thousand persons were killed and wounded during a grand exhibition
of fire-works, displayed in honour of the marriage of the Dauphin to
the Archduchess Antoinetta Maria. Thus was I ushered into existence
amidst shrieks and groans; and neither of my parents ever
beheld their child. My father perished in the streets; the circumstance
was indiscreetly announced to my mother; it brought on premature
labour, and the living infant was taken from a corpse. What
could be expected of such an introduction into life? I had an uncle
residing upon the vine-clad hills that rise near the banks of the Garonne,
a few leagues from Bordeaux, and there I passed my boyhood;
but he was an austere man, and, having a large family of his own, I
was looked upon as an incumbrance, and the only individual who appeared
to commiserate my fate was an aged woman who lived in a
cottage upon the estate, and was looked upon as a sibyl of no mean
pretensions. She it was who first taught me to look upon yon star,
and watch its capricious changes, so as to connect them with the occurrences
of my life; and she it was who read my future fate on the
tablets of inspiration. And who was this female? Twenty years
before she had been the favourite of fortune, enjoying the luxuries of
the capital, yet with an unblemished reputation. She had an only
child,&mdash;a daughter, resplendent in her opening beauty of girlhood,&mdash;a
type of that loveliness with which we characterise the angels. She
was seen in the garden of the Tuileries by that depraved debauchee,
the Fifteenth Louis; his agents secretly forced her to the Parc aux
Cerfs; and the distracted mother, ascertaining the lost condition of
her child, spoke publicly and loudly of the cruel grievance. But
there was a Bastile then, monsieur," added he, with bitter emphasis,
"engines of torture and iron cages to silence babblers; and thither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was the parent sent by order of that monarch, who held the daughter
in his unchaste embraces. That fellow was a wretch, my lord. It was
he, and such as he, that deluged France with blood. The measure of
their iniquity ran over. But the Bourbons were ever an accursed
race. The property of the mother was seized upon by the emissaries
of the police; and when a few years afterwards, she was released
from her imprisonment, it was to find herself a homeless outcast, and
her daughter,&mdash;the beauteous child of her soul's affections,&mdash;the inmate
of a madhouse. Kings should be the protectors, the benefactors
of their subjects; not their bane, their curse, the agents of their
torture. Monsieur, that woman was my relative, and early did she
stamp upon my young heart that hatred to royalty which remains
unconquerably the same to this very hour. Yes, here it is," and he
pressed his hand with energetic firmness over the seat of life; "here,&mdash;here
it is, and, like a memorial carved on the bark of a sapling, it
has become enlarged with my growth, and deeper indented with my
years. It is my fate, monsieur,&mdash;it is my fate.</p>

<p>"The days of my boyhood passed on in mental misery. I felt for
the injuries that had been heaped upon my only friend; I yielded to
her instructions to be prepared against the hour of vengeance, when
retributive justice should sweep tyranny from the throne; I nursed
the hope in the secret recesses of my breast; I cherished it in my
heart's core; it was the subject of my nightly dreams and waking
thoughts; and, whilst other lads sought amusement in boyish pastimes,
the demon of revenge led me into solitary nooks, where I hoarded up
my ardent desire to redress the wrongs of Madame T&mdash;&mdash;. Such,
monsieur, was Jacques Begaud in his thirteenth year, when, tired of a
vegetative life, I quitted my uncle's house, which, though it had been
a place of shelter, had never been a home to me, and travelled on
foot to Toulon. My small stock of money was soon expended; but
yet I wanted for nothing. A piece of bread and a little fruit, with
some wine, no one denied me; and, monsieur, I felt the sweets of
liberty. Why I went to Toulon I do not know, for Paris was my
aim; and Madame T&mdash;&mdash; had prophesied,&mdash;there was something
terrible in her denunciations,&mdash;she had prophesied desolation and destruction
to the house of the Bourbons; and as rumours were spreading
of disunion at court, so did she eagerly feed upon them, and urge
me to redress her wrongs. It is true the debauchee was in his grave;
but then there was his grandson, the celebration of whose marriage
had made me an orphan even before my birth; and, boy as I was,
with a mind care-worn and cankered, I even looked upon <em>that</em> event
as a legitimate cause of hatred."</p>

<p>"But the star, the star!" exclaimed Lord Eustace; "I am anxious
to learn in what manner you considered yourself influenced by the
star."</p>

<p>"Madame T&mdash;&mdash; made it the source of her divination," returned
Citizen Begaud. "She would sit and silently gaze upon it for hours;
and at my departure she bade me observe it on the first day of every
month. If in full splendour, my career for the time would be prosperous;
if shorn of its glory, I was then to expect adversity. I
strictly followed her directions, and my fortunes were as varied as
the brightness of yon orb. At Toulon I was much struck with the
naval yard and arsenal; and in the former I laboured for several
months in the humble occupation of an oakum-picker, gaining not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
only sufficient to keep life within me, but even with my scanty pittance
I contrived to save a small sum, with which I traversed Corsica,
and from thence embarked for Sicily, where I narrowly escaped
one of those dreadful visitations which swallowed up so many thousands
in its vortex. At Messina, where I obtained temporary employ,
one great source of delight to me was standing on the rocky shore
and viewing the fearful commotion of the waters, as they rushed
through the straits. To witness this spectacle I have walked miles;
and the roaring and tumbling of the billows excited in my heart feelings
of joyous pleasure. I had frequently observed a youth of my
own age similarly engaged. He stood with his arms behind him
looking down upon the troubled ocean, as if he wished to penetrate
its hidden depths, and search for undiscovered mysteries; he seemed
to view it as a monster with which he longed to cope, but was coolly
calculating the most appropriate method of effecting his purpose. His
dress was rather superior to mine, and he affected a dignity which
did not suit my companionable qualities. We never spoke; but whilst
I hurled the largest stones that I could lift into the boiling foam, and
saw them, heavy as they were, thrown floating on the surface by the
bubbling fury of the swelling billows, he looked calmly on, disdaining
to move a muscle of his countenance, though his brilliant eyes were
lighted up, and seemed to flash with intense delight. Sometimes I
made approaches to familiarity, but he cautiously repulsed all attempts
at acquaintance; and at length I forbore. Monsieur has been
to Messina?"</p>

<p>Lord Eustace bowed acquiescence.</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful place, and I loved to look at the white buildings
thrown out in strong relief by the dark green forests behind them.
My evenings, when my occupation would admit, were passed upon
the Marina, watching the setting sun. One day I had walked to my
usual spot for witnessing the contest of the currents; and, as I had
frequently done before, I stripped, and plunged into the wave at a
place where the eddies had hollowed out an artificial bay. I loved to
breast the surge, to dash aside the threatening breaker, or dive beneath
its power. My limbs were strong and pliant; I was fearless in
an element that is seldom, if ever, conquered. The afternoon was
sultry; there was an oppressive heat, that seemed to steam from both
land and water, for the atmosphere above was clear and shining. My
star had shone but dimly the night before, portending danger; yet
I knew not from what quarter to expect it. After bathing, I dressed,
and seated myself upon a rock, enjoying the scene, when, on turning
my head, I beheld the youth I have mentioned at no great distance
from me, standing on the extreme angle of low rock that jutted into
the sea. He looked more serious and sedate than ever; there was a
cast of melancholy on his features, and he seemed to be involved in
intensity of thought. Suddenly a darkness overspread us, a heavy
gloom arose; it was the work of a moment; I felt my earth-embedded
seat lifted up, and oscillating to and fro. I saw huge pieces of
solid rock rent from their mountain fastnesses, and hurled, crashing
and thundering, into the torrent that roared and raged with unusual
fury below. I beheld a wall of water rushing through the strait, and,
calling to mind the dimness of my star, I knew the hour of trial was
come: but I was too elevated to fear that mass of liquid element that
swept every thing before it, though the strife that was apparently going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
on within the very bowels of the earth left me but small prospect
of escape. The awful phenomenon at first paralysed my faculties, and
I forgot the pale youth for the moment; but, on looking again towards
him, there he stood, still gazing on the deep, whilst the heavy shocks
of the earthquake were opening graves for his fellow-creatures. Onward
rushed the perpendicular wave, and in an instant he was swept
from his position into the maddened vortex of the hissing foam. I
saw the catastrophe, monsieur, and for a second or two my spirit exulted
in his overthrow; 'But he has parents,' thought I, 'they will
moan his loss; and yet I cannot save him if I would.' The youth
had disappeared beneath the mighty swell that inundated all the adjacent
shore; but again he arose upon the surface, and was borne rapidly
along past the spot where I was stationed. I had no home, no
parents, no one who cared for the destitute outcast, not a creature in
existence whose heart beat with affection for the child of misery; if
I perished, I perished, and there would be none to weep for me.
Without hesitation I sprang into that hissing foam, and was instantly
thrown half body out again by the turbulence of the underset, as it
forced itself to the surface. I struck out steadily and strongly with
my arms and feet, but could preserve very little command as the impetuous
waters rolled me over and over; but still I neared the object
of my solicitude, who kept afloat, and at length I was by his side.
Yet what could I do to aid him in his peril? 'Lift your head well
up!' exclaimed I; 'strike out boldly with the current. I will not leave
you.' He gave me one look; it was full of calm pride. I saw he
was getting weak and required help, yet he disdained to ask for it.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> but that was a struggle for existence! and momentarily
was strength failing in that youth, whilst I felt my own gradually
grow less. 'Dive!&mdash;dive!' shouted I, as I beheld that gigantic wave
returning, in all its terrible vengeance, to meet us; 'dive for your
life!' But he was nearly insensible to my call. I seized him by the
shoulder, forced him under as far as possible, and the enormous billow
passed above our heads. Once more the light of Heaven was
on us,&mdash;once more we could see the blue expanse as if resting like a
canopy on the summits of the mountains, and the eddy had whirled
us to the entrance of an inlet, where the water was comparatively
tranquil. 'Save yourself,' said my companion, 'I will do my best to
follow. Save yourself, my friend.' I know not how it was, but the
appellation, 'my friend,' seemed to instil fresh vigour into me. 'I
will not abandon you,' shouted I; 'and, if you can fetch the cove, we
are both saved.'&mdash;'It is impossible,' answered he; 'run no further
hazard on my account.' His head was drooping, nature was nearly
exhausted; he swam deep, and I became sensible that, unless by some
desperate impulse, I could not save him. I swam close to him, gave
him one end of my neckerchief, and told him to grip it tight; the
other end I fixed between my teeth, and boldly tried for the inlet. A
wave assisted my endeavours; the swell bore me onward, but it was
towards a point where the sea was breaking fearfully high, and the
passage to the inlet was extremely narrow. My companion complied
with my injunctions; yet I could not forbear shuddering when I
looked at the craggy barrier that seemed to foretell our fate. We
neared the rocks, and, had the swell been rolling in, must have been
dashed to pieces; but, just as we approached, the wave was receding;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
it carried us into the inlet stream. Hope cheered me on a few
strokes more: the water was undulating, but smooth; but that youth,
that pale youth, had disappeared. Still he could not be far distant.
I turned, and dived; long practice had rendered me perfectly familiar
with the art. I saw him sinking,&mdash;almost helpless; he was near the
bottom. I went down after him even lower, and, taking renewed
impetus from striking my feet against the ground, I bore him once
more to the surface. The land was only a few yards distant, but his
weight overpowered me. I struggled hard to gain the shore. Despair
began to take possession of my mind; it rendered me desperate.
A few feet was all that divided us from safety, when a dizziness came
over me, my brain whirled, the waters were over my mouth; I thought
of the dimness of my star, and believed my minutes were numbered.
Another rally from the heart produced another effort; my hands
were on the rocks. I grappled them, but my fingers could not retain
their clutch; I slipped away: the water was deep even there, and
death seemed certain. Oh, God! how dreadful was that moment of
suspense! The burthen, which I still sustained, was inanimate, and
I was about to loose my hold of him, when another gigantic wave
swept in; it lifted me on to the flat that I had been striving for; it
receded, and left us on hard ground: the ocean had lost its prey. I
stripped my young companion, chafed his limbs; his heart still beat,
and in about half an hour he evinced signs of returning consciousness.
That moment was to me one of the happiest of my existence.
In another hour he was perfectly restored, though weak; and, leaning
on my arm, we proceeded towards the town. But where was
Messina? that beautiful Messina that we had quitted so recently?
A mass of ruins! A scene of indescribable confusion and dismay!
The inhabitants had thronged to the mountains for a place of refuge;
and, as we entered the deserted streets, a death-like stillness prevailed,
broken only by the deep groan or the shrill shriek of those
who yet remained alive with shattered frames and broken limbs,
unable to escape. Houses were levelled with the ground. Here
yawned a hideous chasm that had buried its living victims; there
lay huge masses of stone with crushed and mutilated bodies beneath
them,&mdash;the dead and the dying. Oh! my lord, it was a fearful spectacle,
and my spirit drank in all its horrors. We sought the humble
residence in which I had found an asylum; no vestige of it remained.
We looked for the more noble mansion in which my companion
had taken up his abode; it was a chaos. Food there was plenty,
Faro wine in abundance; and we amply refreshed ourselves, whilst I
own my heart swelled with pride at the thought that we were the
masters in this once noble city. My companion expressed his gratitude
for the services I had rendered him; but he did it proudly. He
said he was going to France; and my heart yearned to revisit my
native land. I remembered Madame T&mdash;&mdash;, and the solemn pledge
I had given her: I longed to see Paris,&mdash;that Paris of which I had
heard so much; and I earnestly brooded on the schemes which were
to level royalty to the dust. You will say I was but a boy. True!
But what instruction was to others, deadly revenge was to me; it had
been my lesson conned at every season, my sole education,&mdash;and my
teacher fully competent to superintend her pupil.</p>

<p>"But Messina!&mdash;there it lay prostrate with the dust; churches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
thrown down, and the sacred vestments scattered; public buildings
in wreck, hotels and palazzos as if they had never been. We were
standing in the square, when another shock tumbled the fragments
hither and thither, mingling them in greater confusion. My companion
was for hastening up the eminences to see who had escaped: I
preferred remaining, as all places were alike to me; besides, I was poor,
wretchedly poor, and there was the prospect of gold to be obtained.
The pale youth did not tell me his name, nor did I think to ask it: he
gave me a small silver medal that he had worn round his neck by way
of remembrance, and I presented him with a flat piece of whalebone on
which in my idle hours I had rudely carved my name. We parted,
and in a short time my hazardous enterprise was richly recompensed.
I found what I coveted, gold! I filled my slender pockets, and yet
there was gold; I dug a hole and buried my treasure, but still wealth
almost unbounded lay scattered in the streets. I hastened to the
harbour; wrecks and dead bodies were everywhere floating. A boat
was drifting near the quay, and, having secured her, I hastened back
to the place where my riches were concealed. But the marauders
had entered the town, and I feared that they would plunder me; so
I returned to the boat and shoved off from the shore, and there I lay
in her bottom as she drove into the bay, dreading detection, and fearing
to lose my ill-acquired wealth. I had been contented with a
little when only a few copper coins had been my fortune; but, now I
was possessed of gold, I coveted that which I had left behind. A brigantine
that was making her escape from the devastation picked me
up. I offered the captain gold to give me a passage to whatever place
he might be going. My dress and appearance bespoke poverty,&mdash;the
glittering coin betrayed me: I was stripped of every ducat, thrust
into the boat again, and cast adrift upon a tempestuous night. The
only valuable I retained was the medal which I slung round my neck
next to my skin.</p>

<p>"Dark and dreary was the tumultuous ocean as my little vessel
floated at the mercy of the wind and sea; the gale howled fearfully
over me, the waves rolled angrily beneath me; no star illumined the
vault of heaven; but there was a glowing brilliancy of sparkling
lustres on the waters, as if the caverns of the deep had sent forth
their gems to supply the defection of the starry host. The billows
threw up their haughty heads crested with feathery foam, and the
spray saturated my clothes through and through: but the weather
was warm to a child of the North; and thus I continued for many
long lonely hours, till daylight once again appeared. And such a
daylight! The storm had passed away,&mdash;the gorgeous splendour of
the sun as he arose from the horizon was worth all the pain I had
endured only to witness; but his cheering rays came as kindly to my
heart as they were welcome to my person. It was like the smiling
face of a friend to gladden the spirit in adversity. I was at no great
distance from the shore; yet so beautiful was the scene, that, but for
hunger, I should have been contented to have remained gazing on
the spectacle. The cravings of nature, however, were powerful; I
paddled to the rocks, landed, and hurried back to that remnant of a
town I had been so eager to quit. I found no difficulty in appeasing
my appetite: the inhabitants were returning in groups to weep over
their shattered dwellings, and, as they looked mournfully on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
other, most of them were uttering lamentations for a relative or a
friend. Piece by piece I was enabled to change my dress, and make
a more creditable appearance; and this, too, without being over scrupulous
as to the appropriation. I was unknown to every one, for nobody
remembered the poor child of labour. I made inquiry after my
companion of the former day, but could gain no intelligence of him;
and thus I wandered amongst the dust and ashes of ruins, an observer
unheeded and uncared for.</p>

<p>"But I well remembered the spot where I had hidden my treasure,
and, when the shades of evening shrouded the surrounding objects
in their gloom, I went stealthily towards it. No language can
adequately describe the perturbation of my mind; hope and fear,
anticipations of good and evil, the pleasures of anxious expectation,
and the dread of bitter disappointment, alternately held their influence
over me. I had not a marvedi in the world; but, if the place of
concealment was untouched, I was the possessor of wealth beyond
my most sanguine wants for years. I beheld the stone which I had
rolled over the excavation, at once to hide and to direct; its position
was unchanged. I gazed earnestly around,&mdash;I listened for a sound;
but all was solitary and silent. In ecstasy I rolled away the obstruction,
thrust in my arm, and, whilst my fingers clutched the golden
heaps, my breast was on the earth, and I could hear the beatings of
my heart. Thus I lay for some time indulging in delicious dreams of
future enjoyment, not unmingled, however, with those contemplations
which had become harmonised with every action of my existence. At
various intervals I removed my gold to a place of greater security,
and soon after availed myself of an opportunity of returning to Toulon
with the captain who had first of all landed me in Corsica. Oh, what
anxious moments did I pass lest another discovery should deprive me
of my store! I did not dare to close my eyes in sleep, lest my person
or my small matter of luggage should be searched. I no longer
threw myself heedlessly down in any spot to court repose. Suspicion
and distrust poisoned the very source of pleasure; I looked upon all
men as my enemies, because I could confide in none. But I reached
Toulon unmolested, and without loss of time I hastened to the cottage
of Madame T&mdash;&mdash;, vain-glorious of my achievement&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which, to my mind, looks most d&mdash;&mdash;ly like thieving, monsieur,"
said Lord Eustace warmly.</p>

<p>"My lord, I am sensible of the wrong I perpetrated," responded
Citizen Begaud; "but you seem to forget I was a boy, steeped in
poverty to the very lips, bound by a solemn pledge to a certain purpose,
through influences that had actuated me from my earliest remembrances.
I looked upon the gold as a means to further my views.
I had no guide for my youth, and my star&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was, it seems, anything but an honourable one," added Lord Eustace,
interrupting him. "Yet, monsieur, I own your narrative has
interested me; and, under the hope that there is something of a
redeeming quality yet to come, I earnestly request the favour of its
continuation."</p>

<p>The Frenchman bowed, and darkness hid both the frown on his
brow and the flush of anger on his cheek.</p>

<p>"Madame T&mdash;&mdash; had left the neighbourhood of Bordeaux, and
gone to Paris. Thither I followed; but all my efforts were unavailing
to discover her habitation. The internal state of the city was that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
dissatisfaction with the ruling powers; plots and conspiracies were
hatched, quarrels fomented, and the seeds of discord were rapidly
swelling to burst the earth that covered them, and spread into a tree
of monstrous growth. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intriguantes</i> industriously circulated reports
of the queen and the nobility, that were eagerly swallowed by
the lower orders, to increase and justify their hostility to the great.
At first I kept aloof from any decided course, and for two years was
a silent observer of all that was passing around me. I lived frugally,
so as neither to excite envy nor create suspicion; and I saw with inexpressible
satisfaction that the machinery was putting together that
would, when brought into full operation, decide the fate of the Bourbons.
I was almost daily in the vicinity of the palaces, and frequently,
whilst gazing on the beauty of the queen, my purposes were
shaken. Numerous opportunities offered to deprive the sovereign of
his life; but I disdained to become an assassin. Besides, it was not
Louis alone whose downfall I had been taught to consider an act of
justice. It was the whole of the privileged orders, of which he was
the head and chief; and a blow at him would have aroused the aristocrats
to a sense of impending danger.</p>

<p>"Such was the position of my own and public affairs when I had
attained my seventeenth year. But I had not passed the intermediate
time in indolence. I went to school, I studied hard, became an
expert swordsman, and tolerably proficient in the branches of general
education: I perused the works of authors both dead and living;
I tested their writings by a careful examination of men and manners.
But I had yet much to learn. One day I made an excursion on
horseback to Fontainbleau; the royal family were at the palace, and
there was a young female in the suite of her majesty&mdash;Why should I
withhold the fact? Monsieur, my soul was captivated by that angelic
girl. I was not aware that she had ever noticed or even seen me so
as to recall my features to remembrance; I had made no show of my
attachment beyond that silent adoration of the heart which the countenance
is but too apt to reveal. She it was who drew me towards
Fontainbleau, under the hope of obtaining a casual glance. I was
wandering in the forest, nursing the secret thoughts of her who controlled
my actions: evening came on, and darkness surprised me in
one of the most retired parts. I was too well inured to privations
to heed the occurrence. The night was serene and warm, and I
prepared to pass it beneath the branches of some venerable tree; in
fact, I was sitting down for the purpose of repose, when a shouting
and the report of fire-arms at no great distance aroused me to energy.
The direction of the parties was well defined: they might be friends
or foes, honest men or thieves; to me it was a matter of indifference,
for in either case I should find a guide out of the wood. Without
a moment's hesitation I dashed through the tangled briers, and on a
nearer approach ascertained that a deadly conflict was going on. A
few minutes brought me to the scene of action; it was upon the
main road which I had missed, and the opening between the trees
admitted sufficient light to show two of the combatants stretched
upon the ground. There were still two to two engaged with swords;
but one of them fell soon after my arrival, and the survivor turned
to assist his fellow against the only opponent left. Whilst they were
upon an equality I did not care to interfere, especially as I knew not
which was the injured party; but the odds decided me at once, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
snatching up a sword, I placed myself in attitude by the side of the
solitary. My antagonist was a skilful swordsman; but I had time to
observe that the individual whom I befriended was richly dressed,
and by no means a master of his weapon, whilst the person opposed
to him was greatly his inferior. I got close to him, parried a thrust
from my own immediate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">engagé</i>, and returned by a side sleight upon
his comrade, who received it in his breast, and, staggering backwards
with great violence, pulled the sword from my hand and left me
at the mercy of the other. His pass was sure; but, dexterously evading
it, the weapon only went through the fleshy part of my arm, and the
force with which it was given brought it up to the hilt. We grappled
together. I was young and vigorous, but he possessed all the
muscular strength and power of manhood. I felt his grip upon my
throat; we fell heavily together upon the earth. He retained his
superiority above me; and strangulation was rapidly going on, when
suddenly his hold relaxed, he sprang from me, rolled over and over,
and then stretched himself stiffly out a lifeless corpse. The sword
of the disengaged had passed through his heart. I was not long in
recovering sensibility, and on raising my head saw that we were all
down, wounded and bleeding. The gentleman in rich attire was
seated with his back against a tree, wiping the perspiration from his
forehead, and, on seeing me move, he exclaimed, 'Whoever you are,
take my best thanks. If you live, I will prove my sense of the obligation
by more than words; if you die, carry the gratitude of a
nation with you before your maker. But how is it? are you seriously
or mortally hurt? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> this has been no boy's pastime,
anyhow.' I assured him my injuries were not severe; and, to prove
the truth of my assertion, I got up, went towards him, and tendered
my assistance. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grace à Dieu!</i>' said he, 'I have only a few scratches.
But we must not remain here: the rascals have driven off with the
carriage to plunder it; they will return directly to help their comrades.
Are all my fellows dead?' I felt the breasts of each to ascertain
if there was any throbbing of the heart. One of the servants
and two of the robbers were yet living, though desperately wounded,
and I reported to that effect. 'We can expect nothing from them,'
said he, 'and therefore must trust to our own resources. You know
the passages of the forest?' '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Non, monsieur</i>,' returned I. 'My
acquaintance with the forest has been only that of a few hours. I
am a stranger here, and was about to pass the night between the
trees when I heard the report of fire-arms.'&mdash;'Ah! they shot my
coachman,' said he, 'the villains; and my carriage has the edicts in it
for the royal sign-manual, with other matters. Bah! there would be
a pretty prize for the robbers did the rogues know their worth.' This
was uttered to himself, and apparently not designed for me to hear.
'May I inquire the name and rank of the noble who so opportunely
saved my life?' asked I.&mdash;'All in good time, young man; you should
never listen to state secrets. Saved your life, eh? You have been
to court and have learned to flatter. Abandon it, young man: flattery
is bad enough in old age, but detestable from youth. I need
no such incitements to remembrance. Help me rise.' I obeyed.
'And now,' continued he, 'we must find our way to the palace.'</p>

<p>"My heart leaped with joy at the thought: I should see, I should
be near the young Countess de M&mdash;&mdash;. Ever prone to extravagance,
the most preposterous hopes and prospects filled my mind: I laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
outright. 'Are you mad?' inquired my companion. 'In what can
you find cause for mirth?'&mdash;'The heart knoweth its own bitterness,'
returned I, 'and a stranger intermeddleth not with its joy,'&mdash;'True,
true,' responded he. 'But come, let us strive to find our way.' He
put his arm within mine, and silently we traced the road for about
two miles, when we came to one of the lodges that formed a residence
for a keeper, and here we obtained horses and a guide, and in
less than half an hour we were within the walls of that venerable
building the palace of Fontainbleau. My companion had gained a
ready admittance; his word of command was almost electric, and at
first I thought it was the Duke of Orleans, but that his visit to the
royal family would be deemed an insult. At all events I was consigned
to the care of an officer of the household, and I had no cause
to complain of my treatment. After the lapse of an hour, an attendant
summoned me to wait upon the individual I had so timely rescued.
My dress, from being torn by the brambles, certainly was not
much suited for the ostentatious gaiety of a court at a period when
extravagant profusion was considered as essential to the prosperity
of the nation; nor had it lost anything by the struggle on the ground
with the bandit. Still I obeyed without hesitation; and, after passing
through several gorgeous apartments, an officer with a white wand
arrested our further progress. He then tapped gently at an inner
door; there was the tinkling of a bell, the portal flew back, and
within was a resplendent blaze of light that dazzled and confounded
me. I was reassured, however, by the voice of my companion, who
uttered in a low voice, 'Enter, young man;' and obeying, I found
myself in the presence of the king and queen. Louis was seated at
a table covered with toys, and the young prince was on his knee.
Marie Antoinette was watching with the eye of maternal affection
the playful delight of her child; and, much as I had imbibed an undeviating
hatred to royalty, I could not behold the spectacle unmoved.
Near her majesty stood the young Countess de M&mdash;&mdash;, and the fascination
of her beauteous eye enchained my faculties. In a few
minutes the queen and her suite retired, and my companion questioned
me in the presence of the monarch relative to my station in
life, the cause of my being in the forest, and on several other topics,
all which I answered as best suited my own purposes. Louis
spake kindly to me, but his very kindness filled my heart with bitter
feelings; and when, turning to my companion of the forest, he said,
'Monsieur Calonne, we must find some fitting service for this youth,'
I could have stabbed him through and through. This, then, was
Monsieur Calonne, the head of the ministry,&mdash;he who had dared to
propose a tax upon the privileged orders, and had assembled the
Notables to shame them into compliance with his scheme; this was
the man who had plunged the finances of the country into confusion
and ruin, for the purpose of bringing down the pride of the nobles
and the clergy, who had raised him to his elevated exaltation. His
place was one of danger and distrust: he aimed a severe blow at the
privileged orders, without conciliating the people; for, though the
latter applauded the equalizing system, yet they despised the minister
who, by his reckless profusion, was involving them in ruin.
That night I retired&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sail, ho!" was shouted from the forecastle, and Lord Eustace immediately
started from his attitude of deep attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whereabouts is she?" demanded the officer of the watch, his
voice reverberating amongst the sails, and the most profound stillness
reigning fore and aft.</p>

<p>"Broad away on the starboard bow, sir," replied the look-out; and
Lord Eustace, being furnished with his night-glass, walked forward to
examine the stranger, leaving the recital of Citizen Captain Begaud
to be finished at another opportunity.</p>

<p>Oh the rural suburbs of London!&mdash;the filthy suburbs!&mdash;where nothing
is green but the water, nothing natural but the dirt,&mdash;where the
trees are clipt into poles, and the hedges grow behind palings,&mdash;where
"no thoroughfare" forbids you to walk in one place, and the dust
prevents you from walking in another,&mdash;the filthy suburbs!</p>

<p>It was these delightful precincts of peace and "<em>caution</em>," retirement
and "<em>handsome rewards</em>," that Mr. Jacob Tweasle honoured with his
decided preference. This gentleman had inhabited a small shop at
the foot of Snow-hill for more than forty years, retailing tobacco to
the tradesmen, and cigars to the apprentices; and, having by supplying
other people's boxes gradually filled his own, he, how in his sixtieth
year, declined the manufacture of weeds for the cultivation of exotics.</p>

<p>An "Italian villa," beautifully situated in a back lane near Hornsey,
was pointed out to the tobacconist by a house-agent as particularly
"snug and retired." Before the ostentatious white front of this
"enviable residence" were exactly twenty square yards of lawn,
"delightfully wooded" by a solitary laburnum, which was approached
over a highly "ornamental Chinese bridge," crossing "a convenient
stream of water." The interior of the building it was "impossible for
the most fastidious to object to;" the rooms were so low, and the
windows so small, that the happy occupant always imagined himself a
hundred miles from the metropolis; the prospect, too, from the upper
stories "revelled in all the luxuries of the picturesque;" the dome of
St. Paul's lent magnificence to the distance, while the foreground was
enlivened by a brick-field.</p>

<p>Mr. Tweasle saw, approved, yet doubted. He did not know what
to say to it. There was, he acknowledged, everything that heart of
man could desire; the garden was walled in, and the steel-traps and
cabbages might be taken as fixtures; nevertheless he reached the
bridge without having made up his mind. There he paused, and
gazed in anxious meditation upon the black and heavy liquid that
stagnated beneath. "Can one fish here?" suddenly asked the tobacconist,
at the same time leaning over and disturbing the "convenient
stream of water" with his cane.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> never do myself," replied the agent, in such a manner as to imply
that other people frequently did; for Tweasle instantly inquired,</p>

<p>"What do they catch?"</p>

<p>The agent was puzzled. Was the Londoner really ignorant, or was
this a design to test the truth of all his former assertions? It was a
case which required extreme caution. "I am no angler myself,&mdash;I
have no time for that delightful recreation; but&mdash;I should think&mdash;that
eels&mdash;eels&mdash;probably&mdash;eels&mdash;might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stewed eels make a nice supper," interrupted Tweasle with gluttonous
simplicity. "Fish arn't to be got fresh in London."</p>

<p>"Fish ought to be eaten the moment it is taken from the water,"
cried the agent with decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"My boy's got a fishing-rod," said Tweasle; and he took the Italian
villa on a repairing lease.</p>

<p>The announcement of this event created a "sensation" at the foot
of Snow-hill; the Rubicon was past; the business <em>was</em> to be disposed
of; and, that no time might be lost, Mr. Tweasle, without taking off
his gloves, began to scribble an advertisement, while Mrs. Tweasle
waddled into the shop and insulted a customer.</p>

<p>All was confusion. To fly from the paternal protection of the
Lord Mayor, and emigrate off the stones, was no casual event to him
who had hitherto proudly exulted in the freedom of the city. Much
was necessary to reconcile the mind to so bold a measure. The lady
undertook to pack up everything that could be got in London, and
purchase everything that could not be got in the country. The gentleman,
acting as a man should, wholly neglected the domestic. He
gave his attention to the noble arts of agriculture and self-defence,
botanical theories, treatises, and directories. Horticultural implements,
instruments, and improvements, swords and pistols, guns and
blunderbusses, detonating crackers for the shutters, and alarums for
the bedrooms, he spared neither trouble nor expense to procure.</p>

<p>"Now, Hanney, dear," said Tweasle to his wife, surveying the weapons
which had just been sent home, "I thinks here's everything a
contented mind could desire: the thieves will know better than to
come where we are."</p>

<p>But the timid woman's ideas of defence were concentrated in a
flannel gown and a rattle; she looked more terrified than assured:&mdash;fire-arms
and accidents were, in her mind, synonymous; and her only
answer was an urgent entreaty that "those nasty things might be
always so locked up that <em>nobody could</em> get at them."</p>

<p>In due time everything that the family thought they could possibly
want was procured; and when, to render the whole complete, Master
Charles, only son and heir, was commissioned to procure live stock
from St. Giles's, the boy returned with almond tumblers for pigeon-pies,
and bantam-cocks for poultry.</p>

<p>"New-laid eggs for breakfast!" chuckled his papa.</p>

<p>All being at length ready for starting on the following day, and as
the house was dismantled even to the junction of the bed-posts, the
family determined to pass their last evening in London, whispering
soft adieus to their more intimate acquaintance. At first Tweasle
conducted himself with becoming hypocrisy. He lamented his separation
from the "friends of his youth," and ate cake and drank wine
with imposing solemnity; but, as the ceremony was repeated, he
committed himself by an occasional smile, and at last slipped out
something about "poor devils, who were smoked to death like red
herrings." Mrs. Tweasle was shocked, and hurried her husband
away; who, however, warmed into truth, would not acknowledge his
error or go to bed, but insisted on saying good-b'ye to his old friend
Gingham. They found the Ginghams preparing for supper; and, on
company arriving, the servant was whispered "to bring up the beef,"
which Tweasle overhearing, he turned to the hostess, and exultingly
cried,</p>

<p>"Come and see us in the country, and I'll give you stewed eels
and chicken for supper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm very sorry <em>we've</em> nothing <em>better</em> than cold beef to offer <em>you</em>,
sir," replied the lady with a look; "but I can send out."</p>

<p>"Not for the world!" shouted Mrs. Tweasle, who was rejoiced
when a request to be seated relieved her from reiterating her conciliatory
wishes that no one would mind her good man, who during
supper would converse on no other subject than the pleasures of new-laid
eggs and the country, till, having finished one glass of gin and
water, he undertook to explain to his friend how it was that <em>he</em> also
could leave off business like a squire. Nor was this personal investigation
of private family affairs rendered less unpleasant by the indelicate
egotism which induced the exhibitor to illustrate his friend's
faults by his own virtues; till, though repeatedly requested to "drop
it," Tweasle wound up his harangue by calling his host a fool.</p>

<p>"You're a fool, Gingham. You might ha' been as well off as I
am at the present moment, if you hadn't lived at such a rate, like a
fool."</p>

<p>The lady of the house instantly arose, and left the room in company
with her daughters, telling Mr. Tweasle "<em>they</em> were going to bed;"
and Mr. Gingham leant over the table to inform his guest, "he had
no wish to quarrel."</p>

<p>Of the rest of that evening Tweasle the next day retained a very
confused recollection. He thought some one pushed him about in a
passage, and remembered his wife's assisting him to put on his great-coat
in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, the glass-coach which was to convey the
family from London stopped at the foot of Snow-hill. Mr. Tweasle
was the first to jump in; the person to whom the business had been
advantageously disposed of, gave his hand to Mrs. Tweasle, and then
turned to say farewell to her husband.</p>

<p>"All I've got in this blessed world I made in that shop," said
Tweasle, anxious to give his successor a high opinion of the bargain,
and leave a good name behind him. "The many&mdash;many&mdash;happy&mdash;peaceful
days I've seen in it!&mdash;I can't expect to see them again!&mdash;On
a Saturday and on a Monday I've often been fit to drop behind
my own counter, quite worn out with customers. I'm afraid I've
done a rash thing; but I've this consolation, I've left the business in
good hands."</p>

<p>"Come, don't look dull, Tweasle," cried his wife, who was imposed
on by her husband's pathetics: "cheer up! You know trade ain't
what it was, and I'm sure the two last years must have been a
'losing game.'"</p>

<p>It is impossible to say whether he who had bought or he who had
sold the business looked most appalled by this untimely truth. However,
Tweasle was the first to recover himself: he took his victim
affectionately by the hand, and, leaning forward, whispered in propitiatory
confidential accents, "Always put a little white pepper in
Alderman Heavyside's Welsh, or he'll think you've adulterated it."</p>

<p>But the successor was hurt past such slender consolation. With
lofty integrity he spurned the advice of his deceiver; for, jerking
his hand away, and looking Tweasle sternly in the face, he said, "Sir,
I shall do my duty!" and he strutted into the shop; whereupon the
coach began to move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Disposed by this little incident to sadness, its late occupant looked
at the house till his eyes watered. He was no longer a "public
man;" his opinion of the weather was now of no importance; he
might henceforth loiter over his dinner undisturbed by any thought
of the shop! Feelings such as these could not be suppressed, and
Tweasle was about to apostrophise, when his gentle partner startled
him by exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Thank our stars, we're off at last!" and, catching a glimpse of the
house as the coach turned into Hatton-garden, she added, "there's
the last of it, I hope; I never wish to set eyes on the hole again!"</p>

<p>"Don't be ungrateful," said Tweasle, chidingly. "That roof has
sheltered me near forty years."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a nuisance to live in it,&mdash;no place to dry a rag in
but the servant's bed-room."</p>

<p>"And Martha made you give her rum and water, mother, or else
she <em>would</em> catch cold," added the son.</p>

<p>"Stop there!&mdash;stop there!&mdash;stop!" a voice was heard to cry.</p>

<p>"That can't be for us," observed Mrs. Tweasle.</p>

<p>As if in the spirit of matrimonial contradiction, her husband the
next moment exclaimed, "By George! it is though!"</p>

<p>It proved to be a debtor, who had journeyed to London in consequence
of some information which had been afforded him by an attorney.
Three hundred and odd pounds were in his pocket ready for
disbursement, if Mr. Tweasle would accompany him to an inn in the
Borough, and there go through the account This was vexatious.
The <em>fear</em> of losing the money had long disturbed the late tobacconist's
mental monotony, and now the <em>certainty</em> of its payment absolutely
angered him. He turned to his lady, and said to her in a voice of
positive wrath,</p>

<p>"Hanney, I shall go. Don't you wait for me, do you hear? I
shall walk probably in the evening down to Hornsey,&mdash;when I've
given a receipt for the money. Now, sir, I'm at your service. Will
you show the way?"</p>

<p>"Please to remember a poor fellow who wants works," said a florid
muscular mendicant, thrusting his huge hand close to the late tobacconist's
face.&mdash;"The fellow must have overheard the arrangement,"
thought Tweasle; and an undefined feeling of alarm took the roses
from his cheeks. As he hastily threw the man a few pence, he delivered
some very profound remarks upon the Vagrant Act.</p>

<p>"Hanney, dear," cried he in a loud voice, while the beggar was
stooping for the money, "don't make yourself uneasy, but set the
steel-traps. I have pistols,&mdash;mind that, love,&mdash;I have pistols!" for,
afraid to acknowledge his own terror, he found relief in supposing
that others were more timid than himself.</p>

<p>Leaving his wife, Tweasle walked to the inn, where he remained
till all the items of a long bill had been discussed, when the clock
announced the hour of nine, and then the debtor insisted on being
asked to supper, so that it was fairly half-past ten before Tweasle left
the Borough.</p>

<p>So long as the lights of London illumined his way, he proceeded in
comparative composure, only occasionally feeling at his coat-pockets
to assure himself that the pistols were safe; but when the unaided
darkness announced that he had quitted the extremest outskirts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the metropolis, Mr. Tweasle paused, and audibly informed himself
that "he was not afraid:" on receiving which information, he buttoned
his coat closer, slapped his hat firmer on his cranium, frowned, and
shook his head; and, endeavouring to act bravery, took a pistol in
either hand as he marched onward with every symptom of excessive
alarm.</p>

<p>He had not more than two miles farther to proceed, when the distant
notes of St. Paul's cathedral announced the hour of midnight.
At this time Tweasle was creeping along a lane rendered gloomy by
high and parallel hedges, which inclosed fruitful pastures, and prevented
grazing cattle from being impounded; at a little distance from
him, behind one of these "leafy screens," stood a "pensive brother,"&mdash;a
fine he-ass, which had retired thither to nibble the tender shoots
of the mellifluous hawthorn.</p>

<p>As the last vibration died away, he stumbled into a cart-rut. On
recovering his perpendicular, panting from the unnecessary exertion
he had used, the poor traveller stared around him, and endeavoured
to survey the place whereon he was standing. It was a gloomy spot,&mdash;one
unrelieved mass of shade, in which the clouded heavens seemed
to harmonize; everything was in awful repose,&mdash;the night was cold,
but not a zephyr was abroad. Painfully oppressed by the utter loneliness
of his position, a sense of extreme lassitude gradually crept
over Tweasle,&mdash;he closed his eyes, and shuddered violently; he
could have wept, but the fear of being afraid made him suppress the
desire.</p>

<p>"This is a dreadful place!" he said aloud, with much gravity;
"just such a spot as a murder might be committed in. I'm very glad
I'm armed."</p>

<p>Scarcely had he uttered the words, when the donkey thrust forward
his "pensive nose," and shook the hedge by pulling at a switch
of more than common luxuriance. "I'll sell my life dearly!" was
Tweasle's first sensation,&mdash;it could hardly be called idea, it was too
confused,&mdash;as, preparing for attack, he instinctively clapped one hand
upon his money, while with the other he presented a pistol towards
the spot whence the noise proceeded. Not being, as he expected,
immediately assaulted, he by a violent exertion of his mental powers
so far mastered his bodily alarm as to gulp first and then breathe.
He listened,&mdash;all was still. "They didn't know I was armed," thought
Tweasle; "it was lucky I showed them my determination:" and, in
something bordering upon confidence in the effects of his own courage,
he ventured to whisper "Who's there?" when, receiving no
answer, he increased his demand to "Who's there, <em>I say</em>?" in a
somewhat louder voice. He was anxiously waiting the result of this
boldness on his part when the animal, probably attracted by the
sound, slowly moved towards the spot where Tweasle was standing.
"Ah! come&mdash;d&mdash;n&mdash;don't&mdash;now&mdash;I&mdash;I'm armed, you know!"
screamed the traveller, running about and wildly striking right and
left with the pistol, confident that the action this time had positively
commenced; but after some interval, becoming gradually convinced
that he remained unhurt, he was quite satisfied that nothing but the
extraordinary courage he had displayed could have saved him from
this second desperate attempt upon his life; and, somewhat anxious
to support the first dawn of his heroism, he said, or rather stammered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in a voice not always distinct, "Now&mdash;now,&mdash;whoever you are,&mdash;don't
go too far, because it's no pleasure to me to shoot you;&mdash;but I
will, if you do:&mdash;so, in the King's name, who are you?&mdash;I <em>must</em> fire if
you won't speak!"</p>

<p>The last appeal was made more in the tone of entreaty than command,
for Tweasle beheld a black mass thrust itself against the
hedge, evidently inspecting him. A rush of confused ideas, a tumult
of strange suspicions and surmises, a "<em>regular row</em>" of contending
emotions, deprived him of all self-control; and, if the pistol had not
just at that moment accidentally exploded, he had probably fallen to
the ground. As it was, the noise revived him; and, taking advantage
of the circumstance, with a ready conceit he cried out "<em>There!</em>" for
he had seen the object disappear, and heard a faint cry as of one in
agony,&mdash;whereon he walked from the place with every appearance of
impertinent composure.</p>

<p>But this simulation did not long continue. As he became more
conscious, he grew more agitated: he had probably shot a robber.
For this he felt no remorse, and was persuading himself he would
repeat the act, when he discovered that he had lost his pistols. This
discovery gave him a fearful shock,&mdash;he was unarmed! Now came
another dread.&mdash;Was the miscreant he had killed alone? or had he
companions? Did not robbers usually congregate in bands; and might
he not be pursued? But Tweasle was adopting the very best mode of
avoiding such a danger, as, long before he asked himself the question,
his walk had quickened into a sort of hand-gallop, which this fresh
terror increased to the wild speed of utter despair. Without slackening
his pace, the affrighted man had nearly reached his home, when a
sharp blow across the shins brought him to the ground, and, looking
up, Tweasle perceived the mendicant of the afternoon, and two other
suspicious-looking fellows standing over him. He could not speak;
but, turning his face downwards, stretched himself upon the earth.</p>

<p>"<em>Are you going to sleep there?</em>" inquired the beggar with a kick
that was violently anti-soporific; and, seeing that Tweasle naturally
writhed under the infliction, the fellow vociferated, "Come, that
didn't hurt you. It's no use shamming here."</p>

<p>"I shan't wait about, all night for him," cried a diminutive gentleman
disguised in a coalheaver's hat worn jockey-fashion, who, seizing
Tweasle by the collar, lifted him from the ground, and giving him a
shake that was sufficient to render any human nerves unsteady for
eternity, asked the tottering man in a voice of angry expostulation,
"Why the devil he couldn't stand still?"</p>

<p>Too terrified to offer the slightest opposition, the unhappy Tweasle
endeavoured to obey, which spirit of accommodation was repaid by
the most scrupulous attentions. With a delicate dexterity that
scarcely acquainted the owner of the abstraction, everything that his
pockets contained was removed without unnecessary delay; and
Tweasle was beginning to hope that the robbers would be content
with their booty, when one of the fellows, anxious to have his clothes
also, told him in the slang phraseology to undress, by shouting,</p>

<p>"Come, skin yourself."</p>

<p>"Skin <em>myself</em>!" cried Tweasle, understanding the words literally,
and bounding from the place in horror of what appeared to him a
refinement on even fictitious barbarity. "Skin <em>myself</em>!&mdash;You can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
mean it. I couldn't do it, if you'd give me the world.&mdash;It's impossible!&mdash;Oh,
heavens!"</p>

<p>"No flash,&mdash;it won't do,&mdash;you'll undress," said the taller of the
three with a calmness that thrilled his auditor.</p>

<p>"Oh! good gentlemen," continued Tweasle, wishing to touch their
hearts by saying something pathetic, "do consider I'm a married
man!&mdash;think of my poor wife!&mdash;think of my poor wife!"</p>

<p>"Carry her that 'ere with my compliments," cried the beggar,
dashing his fist into Tweasle's face; an act which was received by the
rest as an excellent joke.</p>

<p>"It will do you no good to ill-use a fellow-creature," replied
Tweasle distinctly, as though the blow had refreshed him. "Don't
think I shall resist; take what you please; only, as you are a man&mdash;in
human form&mdash;in this world and in the next&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sugar me! You're just agoing it nicely!" interrupted the mendicant.
"I'm blowed if we pads don't teach more vartey than a bench
of bishops. Never in all my born life <em>borrowed on a friend</em> that the
beggar didn't funk pious and grunt gospel."</p>

<p>"But it is a natural impossibility for any man to skin himself."</p>

<p>"We'll do it for you, if you don't begin."</p>

<p>"Oh my heart! No!&mdash;Think of something else;&mdash;I'm willing to do
anything but that."</p>

<p>"Stow that! Skin yourself,&mdash;shake them rags off your ugly pig
of a body;&mdash;undress, and be d&mdash;d to you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Tweasle, who from this last speech gathered enough to remove
his more horrible misgivings, delicately hinted at the inappropriateness
of the place for such a purpose, the coolness of the night, the
dislike he had to spectators at his toilet, and other things objectionable,
but without effect: his opposition only confirmed the robbers'
resolution, till a smart blow on the left cheek showed that they were
inclined to silence, if they could not convince him.</p>

<p>Reluctantly the old man began to unrobe, parting with his garments
one by one, and begging as a favour he might be allowed to
retain only his waistcoat, on the worthlessness of which he expatiated
till he convinced the plunderers it was of more value than its outside
promised, as proved to be the case, notes to the amount of several
hundreds being found pinned to the lining. They made many mock
apologies for depriving him of this; sarcastically complimenting him
for his modesty, which easily parted with other coverings, but blushed
to expose his bosom: then, kicking him till he fell to the earth, there
they left him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweasle reached the Italian villa as it was getting dusk, and
the family sat up till midnight expecting Mr. Tweasle's arrival. As
the hours advanced, the lady became alarmed, and sent Charles with
a tumbler of rum and water into the kitchen, who, on his return,
announced that Martha had declined the kitchen chair in favour of
John's knee. "Never mind," cried the lady, made considerate by her
fears; "such things are thought nothing of in the country." Whereupon
she proceeded, with a strange concatenation of ideas, to state
her opinion of second marriages; lamented that widows' caps were so
difficult to get up; drank a little more rum and water; endeavoured
to divert her mind with the Newgate Calendar, but could not enjoy
it for thinking how cruel it was of Mr. Tweasle not to come home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
earlier, and openly protested against sleeping alone in a strange house;
then took upon herself, in Mr. Tweasle's absence, to read prayers and
lock up for the night. The signal for retiring being given, each took
a candlestick; but, before they separated, the mistress entreated all
of them to be very watchful in their sleep for fear of robbers, as she
was certain Mr. Tweasle would not be home that night, and did not
know what his absence might bring about.</p>

<p>The subject being once started, every one tarried to relate some
tale of midnight assassination; and all of them selected a strange uninhabited
dwelling as the scene of their agitating incidents. The
straw and half-opened packages which strewed the apartment gave
the place where they were congregated a cheerless aspect; and they
were excited to a degree of listening silence, and staring inquisitively
at one another, while John recounted how a lady of high respectability
chanced to be sitting by herself in the kitchen of a dilapidated
mansion about two hours after midnight, and looking thoughtfully,
not knowing what ailed her, at a round hole where a knot in the
wainscot had been thrust out, when she saw the large dark sparkling
eye of a most ferocious assassin peeping at her through the opening.</p>

<p>Just as John had reached this point of painful interest, the heavy
foot of a man was heard to pass hastily over the bridge, and the next
moment the front-door was violently shaken. The two females instantly
pinioned John by clinging round him with all the tenacity of
terror, while at the same time they were loud in their demands for
that protection which, had they needed it, he was by them effectually
disabled from affording; while Master Tweasle, seizing the rattle, and
aiding its noise with his voice, in no small degree increased the family
distraction; above which, however, was plainly heard some one without,
using his best endeavours to force the entrance. Whoever that
some one was, he appeared wholly unmindful of secrecy; which palpable
contempt of caution, and open disregard of whatever resistance
the inhabitants might be able to make, greatly increased their fear of
the villain's intentions. At each shock the door sustained, shrieks
were uttered by the women, accompanied by a very spirited movement
by the boy upon the rattle; and the interval between these
assaults Mrs. Tweasle employed in murmuring prayers and complaints
to Heaven and John for the protection of her life and property.</p>

<p>At last the assailant appeared to get exhausted; his attempts gradually
became weaker and less frequent. Emboldened by this, the
family ventured to the first-floor window, whence they could plainly
see what all agreed was a countryman in a white smock-frock pacing
to and fro in front of the house in all the bitterest rage of excessive
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Oh, the wretch!" cried Mrs. Tweasle. "What a good door that
is! I make no doubt he knew the furniture was not unpacked; and,
if he could only have got in, he would have carried it all off before
morning: he must have known Mr. Tweasle was not at home. Oh
dear me!"</p>

<p>Soon after she had spoken, the man seemed to have conquered his
vexation, and, approaching the door, he gave a very decent double
knock; but, not receiving an answer, he knocked again somewhat
louder, and then with all his former violence frequently returned,
making actions as if he were vowing vengeance against the family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
or calling imprecations down upon their heads for their resistance:
but of what he said nothing could be heard, for this conduct so
terrified the women that they screamed and shrieked, and Master
Tweasle, as before, accompanied them on the rattle.</p>

<p>At length the robber, as if despairing of entrance, was seen to
retire, but it was only to change the point of assault; they watched
the villain move towards the back of the house; saw him, with a
lofty courage that disdained at broken bottles, scale the garden-wall;
and to their extreme delight, just as they were certain the <em>back</em>-door
would not hold out, beheld him approach the jessamine bower where
John had on the previous evening set one of the man-traps&mdash;and
there he stayed.</p>

<p>A council of war was now held, which would have lasted till morning
had it not been interrupted by Master Charles's firing a blunderbuss
out of the window, thus bravely endeavouring to bring down the
robber at a long shot; and he would have repeated his aim till he
had hit his object, who might be distinctly seen making various
strange contortions near the jessamine bower, had not his mother
forbidden him. The boy, vexed by the check he received, mistook his
ill-humour for bravery, and pettishly volunteered to advance to the
thief, if John would accompany him on the expedition; but Mrs.
Tweasle asked in surprise, "Was she to be left alone at the mercy
of Heaven, without protection?" and John, with strong moral courage
preferring duty to honour, rejected the proposal.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the lad, "come along, Martha."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;<em>me?</em>" cried the girl: "oh, Master Charles!" for the boy,
when he requested her company, only thought that the exchange of
a woman for a man was a vast sacrifice on his part; he never once
considered how the substitution might affect the party it principally
concerned.</p>

<p>Thus abandoned, he had stayed within, had not his mother insisted
that he should not stir out: filial obedience supplied the place of resolution;
he unbolted the back-door, and in a state of obstinate alarm
issued into the garden.</p>

<p>Advancing cautiously, and by a most circuitous way, the boy approached
the jessamine bower, and there discovered <em>his father</em> writhing
and moaning, with one leg fast in a trap, which, according to
his own orders, had been set for the protection of the cabbages.</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear boy, don't fire any more. It's me, Charles! let
me out of this&mdash;I'm dying!"</p>

<p>"Why, if it isn't you, father!&mdash;only wait a bit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Wait!</em>&mdash;don't talk nonsense!" cried Tweasle, looking at his unfortunate
leg, which was held in the trap, and feeling his condition
aggravated by the supposition that it was one of choice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll fetch mother,"</p>

<p>"Hang your mother!&mdash;let me out of this!" ejaculated the poor
man, who was no ways desirous of continuing his agony that it might
be made a kind of domestic exhibition of; but, deaf to his parent's
entreaties, the boy ran away, quite full of his discovery. On the
steps he met the maid-servant, whom he rebuked with much coarseness
for appearing alarmed, and presently returned, marching like a
conqueror at the head of a triumph.</p>

<p>All were much surprised at beholding Mr. Tweasle in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
situation, unrobed and wounded, shivering from cold and terror, and
deprived of all self-command by exhaustion and a man-trap. Mrs.
Tweasle was quite overpowered by the sight: her feelings rather
claimed pity than bestowed it; for while John was removing the
steel trap from his master's legs, she kept moaning, and entreating
her husband <em>only</em> to consider how his conduct had pained <em>her</em>. The
poor maid-servant displayed great goodness of heart; she tenderly
bound her master's naked legs, gently lifted him into the chair that
was brought to convey him into the house, and appeared quite to
overcome the natural delicacy of her sex in the praiseworthy endeavour
to render a fellow-creature every possible assistance; while John and
Master Tweasle seemed more inclined to converse on what had happened
than to mingle in what was taking place, repeatedly putting
questions which the sufferer was incapable of answering, as to wherefore
he did that, or why he did not do this.</p>

<p>Tweasle's injuries were rather painful than dangerous: in a few
days he was convalescent, and was beginning to grow valiant in his
descriptions of his midnight mishaps, when the following hand-bill
was submitted to his notice.</p>

<p>"Whereas a valuable male donkey, the property of Stephen Hedges,
was on the night of the 6th of May last maliciously shot at and killed
by some person or persons unknown; this is to give notice, that
whoever will render such information as shall lead to the conviction
of the offender or offenders, shall receive Five Pounds reward."</p>

<p>For some time after reading this, Tweasle appeared full of thought,
when he surprised his family by a sudden resolution to send Stephen
Hedges five pounds; nor could any remonstrance on the part of his
wife change his charitable purpose. No one could account for this:
in pence the late tobacconist had always been a pattern of benevolence;
but to give <em>pounds</em> was not in the ordinary scale of his charity.
None could assign a reason for so boundless a beneficence,
more than they could comprehend why Tweasle should, whenever
the subject was mentioned, expatiate with so much feeling on "What
the poor ass must have suffered!"</p>

<div class="verse">Her little red eyes were deep set in their socket-holes,</div>
<div class="verse">Her gown-tail was turn'd up, and tuck'd through the pocket-holes:</div>
<div class="verse vi4">A face like a ferret</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Betoken'd her spirit:</div>
<div class="verse">To conclude, Mrs. Pryce was not over young,</div>
<div class="verse">Had very short legs, and a very long tongue.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi4">Now David Pryce</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Had one darling vice;</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi4">That particular day,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">As I've heard people say,</div>
<div class="verse">Mr. David Pryce had been soaking his clay,</div>

<div class="verse vi4">With a couple more soakers,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Thoroughbred smokers,</div>

<div class="verse">And, long after day had drawn to a close,</div>
<div class="verse">And the rest of the world was wrapp'd in repose,</div>
<div class="verse">They were roaring out "Shenkin!" and "Ar hydd y nos;"</div>
<div class="verse">While David himself, to a Sassenach tune,</div>
<div class="verse">Sang, "We've drunk down the Sun, boys! let's drink down the Moon!</div>

<div class="verse">At length, when they couldn't well drink any more,</div>
<div class="verse">Old "Goat-in-Boots" shew'd them the door;</div>
<div class="verse vi4">And then came that knock,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">And the sensible shock</div>
<div class="verse">David felt when his wife cried, "Look at the Clock</div>

<div class="verse">The long at the Twelve, and the short at the Three!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This self-same Clock had long been a bone</div>

<div class="verse">And often among their pother and rout,</div>
<div class="verse">When this otherwise amiable couple fell out,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Pryce would drop a cool hint,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">With an ominous squint</div>
<div class="verse">At its case, of an "Uncle" of his, who'd a "Spout."</div>
<div class="verse vi4">That horrid word "Spout"</div>
<div class="verse vi4">No sooner came out,</div>
<div class="verse">Than Winifred Pryce would turn her about,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">And with scorn on her lip,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">And a hand on each hip,</div>
<div class="verse">"Spout" herself till her nose grew red at the tip,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">"You thundering willain,</div>

<div class="verse">Mrs. Pryce's tongue ran long and ran fast;</div>

<div class="verse">Perhaps in its use he might mean to be lenient,</div>
<div class="verse">But walking just then wasn't very convenient,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">So he threw it, instead,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Direct at her head.</div>
<div class="verse vi4">It knock'd off her hat;</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Down she fell flat;</div>
<div class="verse">Her case, perhaps, was not much mended by that;</div>
<div class="verse">But, whatever it was,&mdash;whether rage and pain</div>
<div class="verse">Produc'd apoplexy, or burst a vein,</div>
<div class="verse">Or her tumble induc'd a concussion of brain,</div>
<div class="verse">I can't say for certain,&mdash;but this I can,</div>
<div class="verse">When, sobered by fright, to assist her he ran,</div>

<div class="verse vi4">Named in my last strophe</div>

<div class="verse vi4">Mr. Pryce, to commence</div>

<div class="verse vi4">But, really, her prating</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Was so aggravating:</div>
<div class="verse">Some trifling correction was just what he meant; all</div>
<div class="verse">The rest, he assured them, was "quite accidental!"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi4">Then he called Mr. Jones,</div>

<div class="verse">The jury, in fine, having sat on the body</div>

<div class="verse vi4">Not far from his dwelling,</div>

<div class="verse vi4">With that sort of stride</div>
<div class="verse">A man puts out when walking in search of a bride.</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Mounting higher and higher,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">He began to perspire,</div>

<div class="verse vi4">And feeling opprest</div>
<div class="verse vi4">By a pain in his chest,</div>
<div class="verse">He paus'd, and turn'd round to take breath, and to rest;</div>
<div class="verse">A walk all up hill is apt, as we know,</div>
<div class="verse">To make one, however robust, puff and blow,</div>

<div class="verse vi4">O'er fell, and o'er fen,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Over mountain and glen,</div>
<div class="verse">All bright in the moonshine, his eye rov'd, and then</div>

<div class="verse vi4">Of mem'ry accurst;</div>
<div class="verse">And the scandalous manner in which he behaved,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">Killing Poets by dozens,</div>
<div class="verse vi4">With their uncles and cousins,</div>

<div class="verse">Of the Court Ball, at which, by a lucky mishap,</div>

<h3>CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.</h3>

<p class="center f90">COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER'S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW'S,
WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG
UTTERED CONCERNING HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND.</p>

<p>Oliver soon recovered from the fainting-fit into which Mr.
Brownlow's abrupt exclamation had thrown him; and the subject
of the picture was carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman
and Mrs. Bedwin, in the conversation that ensued, which
indeed bore no reference to Oliver's history or prospects, but
was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting
him. He was still too weak to get up to breakfast; but, when
he came down into the housekeeper's room next day, his first
act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again
looking on the face of the beautiful lady. His expectations
were disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver's
eyes. "It is gone, you see."</p>

<p>"I see it is, ma'am," replied Oliver, with a sigh. "Why
have they taken it away?"</p>

<p>"It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said,
that, as it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your
getting well, you know," rejoined the old lady.</p>

<p>"On, no, indeed it didn't worry me, ma'am," said Oliver. "I
liked to see it; I quite loved it."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said the old lady, good-humouredly; "you
get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up
again. There, I promise you that; now let us talk about something
else."</p>

<p>This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the
picture at that time, and as the old lady had been so kind to
him in his illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject
just then; so listened attentively to a great many stories she
told him about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who
was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the
country; and a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West
Indies, and who was also such a good young man, and wrote
such dutiful letters home four times a year, that it brought the
tears into her eyes to talk about them. When the old lady had
expatiated a long time on the excellences of her children, and the
merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead
and gone, poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time
to have tea; and after tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage,
which he learnt as quickly as she could teach, and at which
game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a
slice of dry toast, and to go cosily to bed.</p>

<p>They were happy days those of Oliver's recovery. Everything
was so quiet, and neat, and orderly, everybody so kind
and gentle, that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of
which he had always lived, it seemed like heaven itself. He
was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on properly,
than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap,
and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him. As Oliver
was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes,
he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and
asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.
This she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour
window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and
walk away, he felt quite delighted to think that they were
safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his
ever being able to wear them again. They were sad rags, to
tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.</p>

<p>One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as
Oliver was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message
down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty
well, he should like to see him in his study, and talk to him a
little while.</p>

<p>"Bless us, and save us! wash your hands, and let me part
your hair nicely for you, child," said Mrs. Bedwin. "Dear
heart alive! if we had known he would have asked for you, we
would have put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as
sixpence."</p>

<p>Oliver did as the old lady bade him, and, although she lamented
grievously meanwhile that there was not even time to
crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt-collar, he looked so
delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage,
that she went so far as to say, looking at him with great
complacency from head to foot, that she really didn't think it
would have been possible on the longest notice to have made
much difference in him for the better.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door, and, on
Mr. Brownlow calling to him to come in, found himself in a
little back room, quite full of books, with a window looking
into some pleasant little gardens. There was a table drawn up
before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading.
When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and
told him to come near the table and sit down. Oliver complied,
marvelling where the people could be found to read such a
great number of books as seemed to be written to make the
world wiser,&mdash;which is still a marvel to more experienced people
than Oliver Twist every day of their lives.</p>

<p>"There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?" said
Mr. Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed
the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"A great number, sir," replied Oliver; "I never saw so many."</p>

<p>"You shall read them if you behave well," said the old gentleman
kindly; "and you will like that, better than looking at
the outsides,&mdash;that is, in some cases, because there <em>are</em> books
of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts."</p>

<p>"I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir," said Oliver, pointing
to some large quartos with a good deal of gilding about the
binding.</p>

<p>"Not those," said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the
head, and smiling as he did so; "but other equally heavy ones,
though of a much smaller size. How should you like to grow
up a clever man, and write books, eh?"</p>

<p>"I think I would rather read them, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"What! wouldn't you like to be a book-writer?" said the
old gentleman.</p>

<p>Oliver considered a little while, and at last said he should
think it would be a much better thing to be a bookseller; upon
which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had
said a very good thing, which Oliver felt glad to have done,
though he by no means knew what it was.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the old gentleman, composing his features,
"don't be afraid; we won't make an author of you, while there's
an honest trade to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Oliver; and at the earnest manner
of his reply the old gentleman laughed again, and said something
about a curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding,
paid no very great attention to.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder,
but at the same time in a much more serious manner than
Oliver had ever heard him speak in yet, "I want you to pay
great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say. I shall
talk to you without any reserve, because I am sure you are as
well able to understand me as many older persons would be."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't tell me you are going to send me away, sir,
pray!" exclaimed Oliver, alarmed by the serious tone of the old
gentleman's commencement; "don't turn me out of doors to
wander in the streets again. Let me stay here and be a servant.
Don't send me back to the wretched place I came from. Have
mercy upon a poor boy, sir; do!"</p>

<p>"My dear child," said the old gentleman, moved by the
warmth of Oliver's sudden appeal, "you need not be afraid of
my deserting you, unless you give me cause."</p>

<p>"I never, never will, sir," interposed Oliver.</p>

<p>"I hope not," rejoined the old gentleman; "I do not think
you ever will. I have been deceived before, in the objects whom
I have endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to
trust you, nevertheless, and more strongly interested in your
behalf than I can well account for, even to myself. The persons
on whom I have bestowed my dearest love lie deep in their
graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and
sealed it up for ever on my best affections. Deep affliction has
only made them stronger; it ought, I think, for it should refine
our nature."</p>

<p>As the old gentleman said this in a low voice, more to himself
than to his companion, and remained silent for a short time
afterwards, Oliver sat quite still, almost afraid to breathe.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the old gentleman at length in a more
cheerful voice, "I only say this, because you have a young
heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow,
you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again.
You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world; and
all the inquiries I have been able to make confirm the statement.
Let me hear your story; where you came from, who brought
you up, and how you got into the company in which I found
you. Speak the truth; and if I find you have committed no
crime, you will never be friendless while I live."</p>

<p>Oliver's sobs quite checked his utterance for some minutes;
and just when he was on the point of beginning to relate how
he had been brought up at the farm, and carried to the workhouse
by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little double-knock
was heard at the street-door, and the servant, running
up stairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.</p>

<p>"Is he coming up?" inquired Mr. Brownlow.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the servant. "He asked if there were
any muffins in the house, and, when I told him yes, he said he
had come to tea."</p>

<p>Mr. Brownlow smiled, and, turning to Oliver, said Mr. Grimwig
was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a
little rough in his manners, for he was a worthy creature at
bottom, as he had reason to know.</p>

<p>"Shall I go down stairs, sir?" inquired Oliver.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Brownlow; "I would rather you stopped
here."</p>

<p>At this moment there walked into the room, supporting himself
by a thick stick, a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one
leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen
breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the
sides turned up with green. A very small-plaited shirt-frill
stuck out from his waistcoat, and a very long steel watch-chain,
with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it.
The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about
the size of an orange;&mdash;the variety of shapes into which his
countenance was twisted defy description. He had a manner
of screwing his head round on one side when he spoke, and
looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time, which
irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot. In this attitude
he fixed himself the moment he made his appearance; and, holding
out a small piece of orange-peel at arm's length, exclaimed
in a growling, discontented voice,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here! do you see this? Isn't it a most wonderful
and extraordinary thing that I can't call at a man's house but I
find a piece of this cursed poor-surgeon's-friend on the staircase?
I've been lamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel
will be my death at last. It will, sir; orange-peel will be my
death, or I'll be content to eat my own head, sir!" This was
the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed
nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more
singular in his case, because, even admitting, for the sake of
argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being ever
brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his
own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig's
head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine
man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get
through it at a sitting, to put entirely out of the question a
very thick coating of powder.</p>

<p>"I'll eat my head, sir," repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his
stick upon the ground. "Hallo! what's that?" he added,
looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or two.</p>

<p>"This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking
about," said Mr. Brownlow.</p>

<p>Oliver bowed.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that's the boy that had the fever, I
hope?" said Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little further. "Wait a
minute, don't speak: stop&mdash;" continued Mr. Grimwig abruptly,
losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery;
"that's the boy that had the orange! If that's not the boy,
sir, that had the orange, and threw this bit of peel upon the
staircase, I'll eat my head and his too."</p>

<p>"No, no, he has not had one," said Mr. Brownlow, laughing.
"Come, put down your hat, and speak to my young friend."</p>

<p>"I feel strongly on this subject, sir," said the irritable old gentleman,
drawing off his gloves. "There's always more or less
orange-peel on the pavement in our street, and I <em>know</em> it's put
there by the surgeon's boy at the corner. A young woman
stumbled over a bit last night, and fell against my garden-railings;
directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal
red lamp with the pantomime-light. 'Don't go to him,' I called
out of the window, 'he's an assassin,&mdash;a man-trap!' So
he is. If he is not&mdash;&mdash;" Here the irascible old gentleman
gave a great knock on the ground with his stick, which was always
understood by his friends to imply the customary offer
whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his
stick in his hand, he sat down, and, opening a double eye-glass
which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of
Oliver, who, seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured,
and bowed again.</p>

<p>"That's the boy, is it?" said Mr. Grimwig, at length.</p>

<p>"That is the boy," replied Mr. Brownlow, nodding good-humouredly
to Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are you, boy?" said Mr. Grimwig.</p>

<p>"A great deal better, thank you, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend
was about to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step
down stairs, and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea,
which, as he did not half like the visitor's manner, he was very
happy to do.</p>

<p>"He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?" inquired Mr. Brownlow.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Grimwig, pettishly.</p>

<p>"Don't know?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know. I never see any difference in boys. I
only know two sorts of boys,&mdash;mealy boys, and beef-faced boys."</p>

<p>"And which is Oliver?"</p>

<p>"Mealy. I know a friend who's got a beef-faced boy; a
fine boy they call him, with a round head, and red cheeks, and
glaring eyes; a horrid boy, with a body and limbs that appear
to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes&mdash;with the
voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf. I know him, the
wretch!"</p>

<p>"Come," said Mr. Brownlow, "these are not the characteristics
of young Oliver Twist; so he needn't excite your wrath."</p>

<p>"They are not," replied Grimwig. "He may have worse."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently, which appeared to
afford Mr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight.</p>

<p>"He may have worse, I say," repeated Mr. Grimwig.
"Where does he come from? Who is he? What is he? He
has had a fever&mdash;what of that? Fevers are not peculiar to
good people, are they? Bad people have fevers sometimes,
haven't they, eh? I knew a man that was hung in Jamaica for
murdering his master; he had had a fever six times; he wasn't
recommended to mercy on that account. Pooh! nonsense!"</p>

<p>Now, the fact was, that, in the inmost recesses of his own
heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's
appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing, but he
had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion
by the finding of the orange-peel; and inwardly determining
that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking
or not, he had resolved from the first to oppose his friend.
When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry
could he yet return any satisfactory answer, and that he had
postponed any investigation into Oliver's previous history until
he thought the boy was strong enough to bear it, Mr. Grimwig
chuckled maliciously, and demanded, with a sneer, whether the
housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because,
if she didn't find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny
morning, why, he would be content to&mdash;&mdash;, et cetera.</p>

<p>All this Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous
gentleman, knowing his friend's peculiarities, bore with
great good humour; and as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins, matters
went on very smoothly, and Oliver, who made one of the party,
began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce
old gentleman's presence.</p>

<p>"And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular
account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?" asked
Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal: looking
sideways at Oliver as he resumed the subject.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning," replied Mr. Brownlow. "I would
rather he was alone with me at the time. Come up to me to-morrow
morning at ten o'clock, my dear."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Oliver. He answered with some hesitation,
because he was confused by Mr. Grimwig's looking so hard
at him.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," whispered that gentleman to Mr.
Brownlow; "he won't come up to you to-morrow morning. I
saw him hesitate. He is deceiving you, my dear friend."</p>

<p>"I'll swear he is not," replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.</p>

<p>"If he is not," said Mr. Grimwig, "I'll&mdash;&mdash;" and down
went the stick.</p>

<p>"I'll answer for that boy's truth with my life," said Mr.
Brownlow, knocking the table.</p>

<p>"And I for his falsehood with my head," rejoined Mr. Grimwig,
knocking the table also.</p>

<p>"We shall see," said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising passion.</p>

<p>"We will," replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile;
"we will."</p>

<p>As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in at
this moment a small parcel of books which Mr. Brownlow had
that morning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper who
has already figured in this history; which having laid on the
table, she prepared to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin," said Mr. Brownlow; "there is
something to go back."</p>

<p>"He has gone, sir," replied Mrs. Bedwin.</p>

<p>"Call after him," said Mr. Brownlow; "it's particular. He's
a poor man, and they are not paid for. There are some books
to be taken back, too."</p>

<p>The street-door was opened. Oliver ran one way, and the
girl another, and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed
for the boy; but there was no boy in sight, and both Oliver and
the girl returned in a breathless state to report that there were
no tidings of him.</p>

<p>"Dear me, I am very sorry for that," exclaimed Mr. Brownlow;
"I particularly wished those books to be returned to-night."</p>

<p>"Send Oliver with them," said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical
smile; "he will be sure to deliver them safely, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir," said Oliver;
"I'll run all the way, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should
not go out on any account, when a most malicious cough from
Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should, and by his prompt
discharge of the commission prove to him the injustice of his
suspicions, on this head at least, at once.</p>

<p>"You <em>shall</em> go, my dear," said the old gentleman. "The
books are on a chair by my table. Fetch them down."</p>

<p>Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under
his arm in a great bustle, and waited, cap in hand, to hear
what message he was to take.</p>

<p>"You are to say," said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at
Grimwig,&mdash;"you are to say that you have brought those books
back, and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe
him. This is a five-pound note, so you will have to bring me
back ten shillings change."</p>

<p>"I won't be ten minutes, sir," replied Oliver, eagerly; and,
having buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and
placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a respectful
bow, and left the room. Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street-door,
giving him many directions about the nearest way, and
the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street, all of
which Oliver said he clearly understood; and, having super-added
many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the careful
old lady at length permitted him to depart.</p>

<p>"Bless his sweet face!" said the old lady, looking after him.
"I can't bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight."</p>

<p>At this moment Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before
he turned the corner. The old lady smilingly returned his
salutation, and, closing the door, went back to her own room.</p>

<p>"Let me see; he'll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,"
said Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it
on the table. "It will be dark by that time."</p>

<p>"Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?" inquired
Mr. Grimwig.</p>

<p>"Don't you?" asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.</p>

<p>The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig's
breast at the moment, and it was rendered stronger by his
friend's confident smile.</p>

<p>"No," he said, smiting the table with his fist, "I do not.
The boy has got a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable
books under his arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket;
he'll join his old friends the thieves, and laugh at you. If ever
that boy returns to this house, sir, I'll eat my head."</p>

<p>With these words he drew his chair closer to the table, and
there the two friends sat in silent expectation, with the watch
between them. It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance
we attach to our own judgments, and the pride with
which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions, that,
although Mr. Grimwig was not a bad-hearted man, and would
have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and deceived, he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at
that moment that Oliver Twist might not come back. Of such
contradictions is human nature made up!</p>

<p>It grew so dark that the figures on the dial were scarcely discernible;
but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit in
silence, with the watch between them.</p>



<h3>CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.</h3>

<p class="center f90">SHEWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND
MISS NANCY WERE.</p>

<p>If it did not come strictly within the scope and bearing of my
long-considered intentions and plans regarding this prose epic
(for such I mean it to be,) to leave the two old gentlemen sitting
with the watch between them long after it grew too dark to see
it, and both doubting Oliver's return, the one in triumph, and
the other in sorrow, I might take occasion to entertain the
reader with many wise reflections on the obvious impolicy of
ever attempting to do good to our fellow-creatures where there
is no hope of earthly reward; or rather on the strict policy of
betraying some slight degree of charity or sympathy in one particularly
unpromising case, and then abandoning such weaknesses
for ever. I am aware that, in advising even this slight
dereliction from the paths of prudence and worldliness, I lay
myself open to the censure of many excellent and respectable persons,
who have long walked therein; but I venture to contend,
nevertheless, that the advantages of the proceeding are manifold
and lasting. As thus: if the object selected should happen most
unexpectedly to turn out well, and to thrive and amend upon
the assistance you have afforded him, he will, in pure gratitude
and fulness of heart, laud your goodness to the skies; your
character will be thus established, and you will pass through
the world as a most estimable person, who does a vast deal of
good in secret, not one-twentieth part of which will ever see the
light. If, on the contrary, his bad character become notorious,
and his profligacy a by-word, you place yourself in the excellent
position of having attempted to bestow relief most disinterestedly;
of having become misanthropical in consequence of the
treachery of its object; and of having made a rash and solemn
vow, (which no one regrets more than yourself,) never to help or
relieve any man, woman, or child again, lest you should be similarly
deceived. I know a great number of persons in both
situations at this moment, and I can safely assert that they are
the most generally respected and esteemed of any in the whole
circle of my acquaintance.</p>

<p>But, as Mr. Brownlow was not one of these; as he obstinately
persevered in doing good for its own sake, and the gratification
of heart it yielded him; as no failure dispirited him, and no ingratitude
in individual cases tempted him to wreak his vengeance
on the whole human race, I shall not enter into any such digression
in this place: and, if this be not a sufficient reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
this determination, I have a better, and, indeed, a wholly unanswerable
one, already stated; which is, that it forms no
part of my original intention so to do.</p>

<p>In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, situate in the
filthiest part of Little Saffron-Hill,&mdash;a dark and gloomy den,
where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time, and
where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer,&mdash;there sat,
brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly
impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen
coat, drab shorts, half-boots, and stockings, whom, even by that
dim light, no experienced agent of police would have hesitated
for one instant to recognise as Mr. William Sikes. At his feet
sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog, who occupied himself alternately
in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time,
and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth,
which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, you warmint! keep quiet!" said Mr. Sikes,
suddenly breaking silence. Whether his meditations were so
intense as to be disturbed by the dog's winking, or whether his
feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required
all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to
allay them, is matter for argument and consideration. Whatever
was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse bestowed
upon the dog simultaneously.</p>

<p>Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon
them by their masters; but Mr. Sikes's dog, having faults of
temper in common with his owner, and labouring perhaps, at this
moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado
but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots, and, having
given it a good hearty shake, retired, growling, under a form:
thereby just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled
at his head.</p>

<p>"You would, would you?" said Sikes, seizing the poker in
one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife,
which he drew from his pocket. "Come here, you born
devil! Come here! D'ye hear?"</p>

<p>The dog no doubt heard, because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very
harshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain
some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained
where he was, and growled more fiercely than before, at
the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth,
and biting at it like a wild beast.</p>

<p>This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; so, dropping
upon his knees, he began to assail the animal most furiously.
The dog jumped from right to left, and from left to
right, snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and
swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching
a most critical point for one or other, when, the door suddenly
opening, the dog darted out, leaving Bill Sikes with the
poker and the clasp-knife in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old
adage; and Mr. Sikes, being disappointed of the dog's presence,
at once transferred the quarrel to the new-comer.</p>

<p>"What the devil do you come in between me and my dog
for?" said Sikes with a fierce gesture.</p>

<p>"I didn't know, my dear, I didn't know," replied Fagin
humbly&mdash;for the Jew was the new-comer.</p>

<p>"Didn't know, you white-livered thief!" growled Sikes.
"Couldn't you hear the noise?"</p>

<p>"Not a sound of it, as I'm a living man, Bill," replied the
Jew.</p>

<p>"Oh no, you hear nothing, you don't," retorted Sikes with a
fierce sneer, "sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you
come or go. I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute
ago."</p>

<p>"Why?" inquired the Jew with a forced smile.</p>

<p>"'Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as
you, as haven't half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill his dog how
he likes," replied Sikes, shutting the knife up with a very expressive
look; "that's why."</p>

<p>The Jew rubbed his hands, and, sitting down at the table,
affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend,&mdash;obviously
very ill at his ease, however.</p>

<p>"Grin away," said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying
him with savage contempt; "grin away. You'll never have the
laugh at me, though, unless it's behind a nightcap. I've got
the upper hand over you, Fagin; and, d&mdash;me, I'll keep it.
There. If I go, you go; so take care of me."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear," said the Jew, "I know all that; we&mdash;we&mdash;have
a mutual interest, Bill,&mdash;a mutual interest."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay
rather more on the Jew's side than on his. "Well, what have
you got to say to me?"</p>

<p>"It's all passed safe through the melting-pot," replied Fagin,
"and this is your share. It's rather more than it ought to be,
my dear; but as I know you'll do me a good turn another time,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Stow that gammon," interposed the robber impatiently.
"Where is it? Hand over!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time," replied the
Jew soothingly. "Here it is&mdash;all safe." As he spoke, he drew
forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast, and, untying
a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet,
which Sikes snatching from him, hastily opened, and proceeded
to count the sovereigns it contained.</p>

<p>"This is all, is it?" inquired Sikes.</p>

<p>"All," replied the Jew.</p>

<p>"You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two
as you come along, have you?" inquired Sikes suspiciously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
"Don't put on a injured look at the question; you've done it
many a time. Jerk the tinkler."</p>

<p>These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to
ring the bell. It was answered by another Jew, younger
than Fagin, but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance.</p>

<p>Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure, and the Jew,
perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it, previously
exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes
for an instant as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in
reply so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible
to a third person. It was lost upon Sikes, who was
stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had
torn. Possibly if he had observed the brief interchange of signals,
he might have thought that it boded no good to him.</p>

<p>"Is anybody here, Barney?" inquired Fagin, speaking&mdash;now
that Sikes was looking on&mdash;without raising his eyes from the
ground.</p>

<p>"Dot a shoul," replied Barney, whose words, whether they
came from the heart or not, made their way through the nose.</p>

<p>"Nobody?" inquired Fagin in a tone of surprise, which perhaps
might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.</p>

<p>"Dobody but Biss Dadsy," replied Barney.</p>

<p>"Miss Nancy!" exclaimed Sikes. "Where? Strike me
blind, if I don't honor that 'ere girl for her native talents."</p>

<p>"She's bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar," replied
Barney.</p>

<p>"Send her here," said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor;
"send her here."</p>

<p>Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the
Jew remaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground,
he retired, and presently returned ushering in Miss Nancy,
who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door
key complete.</p>

<p>"You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?" inquired Sikes,
proffering the glass.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, Bill," replied the young lady, disposing of its
contents; "and tired enough of it I am, too. The young
brat's been ill and confined to the crib; and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Nancy, dear!" said Fagin, looking up.</p>

<p>Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew's red eyebrows,
and a half-closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss
Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, is not a
matter of much importance. The fact is all we need care for
here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself, and,
with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation
to other matters. In about ten minutes' time, Mr. Fagin
was seized with a fit of coughing, upon which Miss Nancy
pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to
go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her
way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
they went away together, followed at a little distance by the
dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his master was
out of sight.</p>

<p>The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes
had left it, looked after him as he walked up the dark passage,
shook his clenched fist, muttered a deep curse, and then with a
horrible grin reseated himself at the table, where he was soon
deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue and Cry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within
so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his
way to the bookstall. When he got into Clerkenwell he accidentally
turned down a by-street which was not exactly in his
way; but not discovering his mistake till he had got halfway
down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he did
not think it worth while to turn back, and so marched on as
quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.</p>

<p>He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he
ought to feel, and how much he would give for only one look at
poor little Dick, who, starved and beaten, might be lying dead
at that very moment, when he was startled by a young woman
screaming out very loud, "Oh, my dear brother!" and he had
hardly looked up to see what the matter was, when he was
stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck.</p>

<p>"Don't!" cried Oliver struggling. "Let go of me. Who is
it? What are you stopping me for?"</p>

<p>The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations
from the young woman who had embraced him, and
who had got a little basket and a street-door key in her hand.</p>

<p>"Oh my gracious!" said the young woman, "I've found
him! Oh, Oliver! Oliver! Oh, you naughty boy, to make
me suffer such distress on your account! Come home, dear,
come. Oh, I've found him. Thank gracious goodness heavins,
I've found him!" With these incoherent exclamations the
young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully
hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the
moment asked a butcher's boy, with a shiny head of hair
anointed with suet, who was also looking on, whether he didn't
think he had better run for the doctor. To which the butcher's
boy, who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent disposition,
replied that he thought not.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, never mind," said the young woman, grasping
Oliver's hand; "I'm better now. Come home directly, you
cruel boy, come."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, ma'am?" inquired one of the women.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am," replied the young woman, "he ran away near
a month ago from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable
people, and joined a set of thieves and bad characters,
and almost broke his mother's heart."</p>

<p>"Young wretch!" said one woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go home, do, you little brute," said the other.</p>

<p>"I'm not," replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. "I don't know
her. I haven't got any sister, or father and mother either. I'm
an orphan; I live at Pentonville."</p>

<p>"Oh, only hear him, how he braves it out!" cried the young
woman.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Nancy!" exclaimed Oliver, who now saw her face
for the first time, and started back in irrepressible astonishment.</p>

<p>"You see he knows me," cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders.
"He can't help himself. Make him come home,
there's good people, or he'll kill his dear mother and father,
and break my heart!"</p>

<p>"What the devil's this?" said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop,
with a white dog at his heels; "young Oliver! Come home
to your poor mother, you young dog! come home directly."</p>

<p>"I don't belong to them. I don't know them. Help! help!"
cried Oliver, struggling in the man's powerful grasp.</p>

<p>"Help!" repeated the man. "Yes; I'll help you, you
young rascal! What books are these? You've been a stealing
'em, have you? Give 'em here!" With these words the man
tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck him violently on
the head.</p>

<p>"That's right!" cried a looker-on, from a garret window.
"That's the only way of bringing him to his senses!"</p>

<p>"To be sure," cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving
look at the garret-window.</p>

<p>"It'll do him good!" said the two women.</p>

<p>"And he shall have it, too!" rejoined the man, administering
another blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. "Come on, you
young villain! Here, Bull's-eye, mind him, boy! mind him!"</p>

<p>Weak with recent illness, stupified by the blows and the
suddenness of the attack, terrified by the fierce growling of the
dog and the brutality of the man, and overpowered by the conviction
of the bystanders that he was really the hardened little
wretch he was described to be, what could one poor child do?
Darkness had set in; it was a low neighbourhood; no help was
near; resistance was useless. In another moment he was dragged
into a labyrinth of dark, narrow courts, and forced along
them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give
utterance to, wholly unintelligible. It was of little moment,
indeed, whether they were intelligible or not, for there was nobody
to care for them had they been ever so plain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously
at the open door; the servant had run up the street
twenty times, to see if there were any traces of Oliver; and
still the two old gentlemen sat perseveringly in the dark parlour,
with the watch between them.</p>

<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY GEORGE HOGARTH.</p>


<p>There are few things in the history of mankind more extraordinary
than the frightful extent to which the crime of secret poisoning
was carried, in several countries of Europe, during a large portion of
the seventeenth century. It appears to have taken its rise in Italy,
where it prevailed to a degree that is almost incredible. The instrument
chiefly used in its perpetration was a liquid called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aqua
tofana</i>, from the name of Tofania, its inventor, a woman who has
acquired an infamous celebrity. According to the account of Hoffmann,
the famous physician, this woman confessed that she had used
this liquid in poisoning above six hundred persons; and Gmelin says
that more people were destroyed by it than by the plague, which had
raged for some time before it came into use. This crime also prevailed,
though for a shorter time and to a smaller extent, in France;
and was far from being unknown in England. We intend to give our
readers such information as we have collected on this curious subject;
and though the most regular way might be to begin with the
Signora Tofania herself, and the diffusion of her practices in her own
country, we prefer giving at present the history of the most eminent
of her followers, the Marchioness de Brinvillier, whose atrocities
created so much excitement in France in the time of Louis the Fourteenth,
as we shall thus be enabled at once to place the matter in its
most striking light. We have consulted, we believe, most of the
French works in which there are any particulars respecting this lady;
and our readers may take the following as a faithful account of her
life.</p>

<p>Marie-Marguerite d'Aubray was the daughter of M. d'Aubray, a
gentleman who held a considerable judicial office in Paris. In 1651
she married the Marquis de Brinvillier. The match was a suitable
one, both in respect to station and property. The marquis had
estates of thirty thousand livres a-year; and his wife, who had two
brothers and a sister, brought him a fortune of two hundred thousand
livres, with the prospect of a considerable share of her father's inheritance.
The marchioness enjoyed the gifts of nature as well as of
fortune. Her figure was not remarkably handsome, but her face was
round and pretty, with a serene and quiet expression; and she had
an air of innocence, simplicity, and good-nature which gained the
confidence of everybody who had any intercourse with her.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Brinvillier was colonel of a regiment of foot.
While on service, he had contracted an intimacy with a gentleman of
the name of St. Croix, a captain of cavalry. There was some mystery
about this man's birth. It was known that he was from Montauban.
Some thought him an illegitimate scion of a noble house;
others said he belonged to a respectable family; but all agreed that
he was totally destitute of the gifts of fortune.</p>

<p>The part which this personage acted in the occurrences of which
we are about to give a sketch, makes it worth while to repeat the description
of him contained in some of the memoirs of the time. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
countenance was handsome and intelligent; he was remarkably courteous
and obliging, and entered into any benevolent or pious proposal
with the same alacrity with which he agreed to commit a crime.
He was vindictive, susceptible of love, and jealous to madness. His
extravagance was unbounded, and, being unsupported by any regular
income, led him into every sort of wickedness. Some years before
his death, he assumed an appearance of devotion, and it is said even
wrote some tracts on religious subjects.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Brinvillier was much addicted to pleasure. St.
Croix got into his good graces, and was introduced into his house.
At first he was only the husband's friend, but presently he became the
wife's lover; and their attachment became mutual. The dissipation
of the marquis's life prevented him from observing his wife's conduct,
so that the pair carried on a guilty commerce without any suspicion
on his part. His affairs became so disordered, that his wife succeeded,
on this ground, in obtaining a separation, and after this paid
no respect to decency or concealment in her connexion with her
paramour. Scandalous, however, as her conduct was, it made no
impression on the mind of the marquis, whose apathy induced the
marchioness's father, M. d'Aubray, to use his paternal authority. He
obtained a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettre de cachet</i> against St. Croix, who was arrested one day
when he was in a carriage with the marchioness, and carried to the
Bastile, where he remained for a year.</p>

<p>Absence, far from abating the marchioness's passion, only inflamed
it; and the constraint to which she found it necessary to subject herself
in order to prevent a second separation, inflamed it still more.
She conducted herself, however, with such apparent propriety, that
she regained her father's favour, and even his confidence. St. Croix
availed himself of the power which love had given him over his mistress
to root out every good principle or feeling from her mind.
Under his horrid lessons she became a monster, whose atrocities, we
hope and believe, have hardly ever been paralleled. He resolved to
take a dreadful revenge on the family of d'Aubray, and at the same
time to get his whole property into the possession of the marchioness,
that they might spend it together in guilty pleasures.</p>

<p>While St. Croix was in the Bastile, he had formed an acquaintance
with an Italian of the name of Exili, to whom he communicated his
views. Exili excited him to vengeance, and taught him the way to
obtain it with impunity. Poisoning may be called, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, an
Italian art. With many fine qualities, vindictiveness and subtlety
must be acknowledged to be strong features in the character of that
people; and hence their early superiority in this art of taking the
most deadly, and at the same time the safest, revenge on their enemies.
It appears, accordingly, (as we have already said,) that it was
from the Italians that the poisoners of other countries derived their
skill. They acquired the art of composing poisons so disguised in
their appearance and subtle in their effects, that they baffled the penetration
and art of the physicians of that age. Some were slow,
and consumed the vitals of the victim by almost imperceptible degrees;
others were sudden and violent in their action; but few of
them left any traces of their real nature, for the symptoms they produced
were generally so equivocal, that they might be ascribed to
many ordinary diseases. St. Croix greedily devoured the instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of his fellow-prisoner, and left the Bastile prepared to exercise
his infernal art.</p>

<p>His first object of vengeance was M. d'Aubray himself; and he
soon found means to persuade the daughter to become the agent in
the destruction of her father. The old gentleman had a house in the
country, where he used to spend his vacations. All his fondness for
his daughter, whom he now believed to have been "more sinned
against than sinning," had returned; and she, on her part, behaved
to him with an appearance of affectionate duty. She anxiously attended
to his every comfort; and, as his health had suffered from the
fatigues of his office, she employed herself in superintending the preparation
of nice and nourishing broths, which she gave him herself
with every appearance of tender care. It is needless to say that
these aliments contained some articles of Italian cookery; and the
wretch, as she sat by his bed-side, witnessing his sufferings and listening
to his groans, shed abundance of crocodile tears, while she
eagerly administered to him remedies calculated to insure the accomplishment
of her object. But neither the agonies of the poor old
man, nor his touching expressions of love and gratitude to the fiend
at his side, could turn her for a moment from her fell purpose. He
was carried back to Paris, where in a few days he sunk under the
effects of the poison.</p>

<p>No suspicion was entertained of the cause of his death; the idea
of such a crime could not even have entered into the imagination of
any one. No external symptoms appeared, and the expedient of
opening the body was never thought of. The friends of the family
were desirous only of pitying and comforting them; and the inconsolable
daughter, who had tended her father with such filial piety,
had the largest share of sympathy. She returned as soon as possible
to the arms of her paramour, and made up for the restraint imposed
on her during her father's life by spending the money she had inherited
by his death in undisguised profligacy.</p>

<p>It afterwards appeared that this abandoned woman had made sure
of the efficacy of her drugs by a variety of experiments, not only
upon animals, but on human beings. She was in the habit of distributing
to the poor poisoned biscuits, prepared by herself, the effect
of which she found means to learn without committing herself. But
this was not enough: she desired to be an eye-witness of the progress
and symptoms of the effects produced by the poison; and for this
purpose made the experiment on Françoise Roussel, her maid, to
whom she gave, by way of treat, a plate of gooseberries and a slice
of ham. The poor girl was very ill, but recovered; and this was a
lesson to St. Croix to make his doses stronger.</p>

<p>Madame de Sevigné, in one of her letters, written at a time when
the public attention was engrossed by this strange affair, says, "La
Brinvillier used to poison pigeon-pies, which caused the death of
many people whom she had no intention of destroying. The Chevalier
du Guet was at one of these pretty dinners, and died of it two or
three years ago. When in prison, she asked if he was dead, and
was told he was not. 'His life must be very tough, then,' said she.
M. de la Rochefoucauld declares that this is perfectly true."</p>

<p>M. d'Aubray's inheritance was not so beneficial to his infamous
daughter as she had expected. The best part of his property went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to his son, M. d'Aubray, who succeeded to his father's office, and
another brother a counsellor. It was necessary, therefore, to put
them out of the way also; and this task St. Croix, thinking his accomplice
had done enough for his purposes, took upon himself.</p>

<p>He had a villain at his devotion of the name of La Chaussée. This
man had been in his service, and he knew him to be a fit agent in any
atrocity. The marchioness got La Chaussée a place as servant to
the counsellor, who lived with his brother the magistrate, taking
great care to conceal from them that he had ever been in the service
of St. Croix. La Chaussée's employers promised him a hundred pistoles
and an annuity for life if he succeeded in causing the death of
the magistrate, who was their first object of attack. His anxiety to
do his business promptly made him fail in his first attempt. He gave
the magistrate a glass of poisoned wine and water; but the dose was
too strong: and no sooner had the magistrate put his lips to the
glass, than he cried, "Ah, you scoundrel, what is this you have given
me?&mdash;do you want to poison me?" He showed the liquid to his
secretary, who, having examined it in a spoon, said it was bitter, and
had a smell of vitriol. La Chaussée did not lose countenance, but,
without any appearance of confusion, took the glass and poured out
the liquor, saying that the younger M. d'Aubray's valet had taken
some medicine in this glass, which had produced the bitter taste.
He got off with a reprimand for his carelessness, and the matter was
no more thought of.</p>

<p>This narrow escape from a discovery did not deter the murderers
from prosecuting their design; but they took more effectual measures
for its success, not caring though they should sacrifice by the
same blow a number of people with whom they had no concern.</p>

<p>In the beginning of April 1670, the magistrate went to pass the
Easter holidays at his house in the country. His brother the counsellor
was of the party, and was attended by La Chaussée. One day
at dinner there was a giblet-pie. Seven persons who eat of it became
very ill, while those who had not partaken of it suffered no uneasiness.
The two brothers were among the former, and had violent fits
of vomiting. They returned to Paris a few days afterwards, having
the appearance of persons who had undergone a long and violent
illness.</p>

<p>St. Croix availed himself of this state of things to make sure of the
fruit of his crimes. He obtained from the marchioness two promissory
deeds, one for thirty thousand livres in his own name, and another
for twenty-five thousand livres in the name of Martin, one of
his familiars. The sum at first sight appears a small one, amounting
only to about two thousand three hundred pounds sterling; but the
immense difference in the value of money since the seventeenth century
must be taken into account. Such, however, at all events, was
the price paid by this demon for the death of her two brothers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the elder d'Aubray became worse and worse; he could
take no sustenance, and vomited incessantly. The three last days
of his life he felt a fire in his stomach, which seemed to be consuming
its very substance. At length he expired on the 17th of
June 1670. On being opened, his stomach and <em>duodenum</em> were
black, and falling to pieces, as if they had been put on a large fire;
and the liver was burnt up and gangrened. It was evident that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
had been poisoned: but on whom could suspicion fall?&mdash;there was
no clue whatever to guide it. The marchioness had gone to the
country. St. Croix wrote her that the magistrate was dead, and that,
from his brother's situation, he must soon follow. It so turned out.
The unfortunate counsellor died, after having lingered three months
in excruciating torments; and he was so far from suspecting La
Chaussée of any hand in his death, that he left him a legacy of three
hundred livres, which was paid.</p>

<p>These three murders were still insufficient. There was yet a
sister who kept from the marchioness the half of the successions
which she wished to gain by the death of her father and brothers.
The sister's life was repeatedly attempted in the same way; but the
shocking occurrences in her family had made her suspicious, and her
precautions preserved her.</p>

<p>The poor Marquis de Brinvillier was intended by his fury of a
wife for her next victim. "Madame de Brinvillier," says Madame
de Sevigné in another of her letters, "wanted to marry St. Croix,
and for that purpose poisoned her husband repeatedly. But St.
Croix, who had no desire to have a wife as wicked as himself, gave
the poor man antidotes; so that, having been tossed backward and
forward in this way, sometimes poisoned, and sometimes <em>un</em>poisoned,
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">désempoisonné</i>), he has, after all, got off with his life."</p>

<p>Though everybody was convinced that the father and his two
sons had been poisoned, yet nothing but very vague suspicions were
entertained as to the perpetrators of the crime. Nobody thought of
St. Croix as having had anything to do with it. He had for a long
time ceased, to all appearance, to have any connexion with Madame
de Brinvillier; and La Chaussée, the immediate agent, had played
his part so well, that he was never suspected.</p>

<p>At last the horrible mystery was discovered. St. Croix continued
to practise the art which had been so useful to him; and, as the poisons
he made were so subtle as to be fatal even by respiration, he
used to intercept their exhalations while compounding them by a
glass mask over his face. One day the mask by accident dropped
off, and he fell dead on the spot; "a death," says the French writer
who mentions this occurrence, "much too good for a monster who
had inflicted it by long and agonizing pangs on so many valuable
citizens."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Having no relations that were known, his repositories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
were sealed up by the public authorities. When they were opened
and examined, the first thing which was found was a casket, in which
was a paper in the following terms:</p>

<p>"I earnestly request those into whose hands this casket may fall,
to deliver it into the hands of Madame la Marquise de Brinvillier, residing
in the Rue Neuve St. Paul, seeing that all that it contains
concerns and belongs to her only, and that it can be of no use to
any person in the world except herself; and, in case of her being
dead before me, to burn it, and all that it contains, without opening
or meddling with anything. And should any one contravene these
my intentions on this subject, which are just and reasonable, I lay
the consequences on their head, both in this world and the next; protesting
that this is my last will. Done at Paris this 25th May, afternoon,
1672. (Signed) De Sainte Croix."</p>

<p>The casket contained a number of parcels carefully sealed up, and
some phials containing liquids. The parcels were found to contain a
variety of drugs, which, having been submitted to the examination of
physicians, were found to be most subtle and deadly poisons. This
was ascertained by many experiments made upon pigeons, dogs, cats,
and other animals, all which were detailed in a formal report made on
the subject. It is stated in that report that no traces of the action
of the poison, either external or internal, appeared on the bodies of
the animals which had perished by it, and that it was impossible to
detect its existence by any chemical tests. It would appear, therefore,
that St. Croix had by his studies greatly increased in skill since
the deaths of the d'Aubray family. The poisons administered to
them were of a comparatively coarse and ordinary kind; they burnt
up the stomach and bowels, produced horrid torment, and left unequivocal
marks of their operation when any suspicion caused these
marks to be sought for. But, with the skill subsequently acquired,
this hateful pair might have destroyed thousands of their fellow-creatures
with absolute impunity. It is impossible to suppose that
St. Croix could have been constantly engaged, for a long series of
years, in the composition of these secret instruments of death without
making use of them; and there is no saying to what extent his
work of destruction may have been carried.</p>

<p>The same casket contained ample evidence of the marchioness's
share in these transactions. There were a number of letters from her
to St. Croix, and the deed of promise which she had executed in his
favour for thirty thousand livres.</p>

<p>When the marchioness heard that St. Croix was dead, and that his
repositories had been sealed up, she showed the utmost anxiety to
get possession of the casket. At ten o'clock at night she came to the
house of the commissary who had affixed and taken off the seals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
desired to speak with him. Being told by his clerk that he was
asleep, she said she had come to inquire about a casket which belonged
to her, and which she wished to get back, and would return
next day. When she came back, she was told that the casket could
not be given up to her. Thinking it high time, therefore, to take care
of herself, she went off during the following night, and took refuge in
Liege; leaving, however, a power to an attorney to appear for her
and contest the validity of the promise she had given to St. Croix.
La Chaussée, too, had the impudence to put in a claim to certain
sums of money, which, as he pretended, belonged to him, and which
were deposited, in places which he mentioned, in St. Croix's study.
This proved that La Chaussée was acquainted with the localities of a
place into which it was to be presumed that St. Croix admitted none
but his confidants and confederates; and La Chaussée was arrested
on suspicion, which was greatly strengthened by the confusion he betrayed
when informed of the discoveries made at the removal of the
seals.</p>

<p>A judicial inquiry was now set on foot, and many witnesses examined.
Among others, Anne Huet, an apothecary's daughter, who
was a sort of servant of the marchioness, deposed, that one day, when
the marchioness was intoxicated, she had the imprudence to show
the witness a little box which she took out of a casket, and which,
she said, contained the means of getting rid of her enemies, and acquiring
good inheritances. Mademoiselle Huet saw that the box
contained sublimate of mercury in powder and in paste. Afterwards,
when the fumes of the wine had evaporated, the witness told the
marchioness what she had said. "Oh," she said, "I was talking nonsense;"
but at the same time she earnestly begged her not to repeat
what she had heard. The marchioness (this witness added) was in
the habit, when anything chagrined her, to say she would poison herself.
She said there were many ways of getting rid of people when
they stood in one's way,&mdash;a bowl of broth was as good as a pistol-bullet.
The girl added, that she had often seen La Chaussée with
Madame de Brinvillier, who chatted familiarly with him; and that she
had heard the marchioness say, "He is a good lad, and has been very
serviceable to me." Mademoiselle Villeray, another witness, declared
that she had seen La Chaussée on a very familiar footing with Madame
de Brinvillier; that she had seen them alone together since the
death of the magistrate; that, two days after the death of the counsellor,
she made La Chaussée hide himself behind the bed-curtains
when the magistrate's secretary came to see her. La Chaussée himself,
on his examination, admitted this fact. Other persons related
that La Chaussée, when he was asked how his master was during his
illness, used to say, "Oh, he lingers on, the&mdash;&mdash;!" adding a coarse
epithet; "he gives us a deal of trouble. I wonder when he will kick
the bucket."</p>

<p>On the 4th of March 1673, the court of La Tournelle pronounced
a sentence, whereby La Chaussée was convicted of having poisoned
the magistrate and the counsellor, and condemned to be broke alive
upon the wheel, after having been put to the question ordinary and
extraordinary, to discover his accomplices; and the Marchioness de
Brinvillier was condemned, by default, to be beheaded. Under the
torture, La Chaussée confessed his crimes, and gave a full account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
all the transactions we have related, in so far as he was connected
with them. He was executed in the Place de Grêve, according to
his sentence.</p>

<p>Desgrais, an officer of the Marechaussée, was sent to Liege to arrest
the marchioness. He was provided with an escort, and a letter
from the king to the municipality of that city, requesting that the
criminal might be delivered up. Desgrais was permitted to arrest
her and carry her to France.</p>

<p>She had retired to a convent, a sanctuary in which Desgrais durst
not attempt to seize her; he therefore had recourse to stratagem.
Disguising himself in an ecclesiastical habit, he paid her a visit, pretending
that, being a Frenchman, he could not think of passing
through Liege without seeing a lady so celebrated for her beauty and
misfortunes. He even went so far as to play the gallant, and his
amorous advances were as well received as he could desire. He persuaded
the lady to take a walk with him; but they had no sooner got
into the fields than the lover transformed himself into a police-officer.
He arrested the lady, and put her into the hands of his followers,
whom he had placed in ambush near the spot; and then, having obtained
an order from the authorities to that effect, he made a search
in her apartment. Under her bed he found a casket, which she vehemently
insisted on having returned to her, but without effect. She
then tried to bribe one of the officer's men, who pretended to listen to
her, and betrayed her. During her retreat she had carried on an intrigue
with a person of the name of Theria. To him she wrote a
letter, (which she intrusted to her confidant,) beseeching him to come
with all haste and rescue her from the hands of Desgrais. In a second
letter she told him that the escort consisted only of eight persons,
who could easily be beaten by five. In a third, she wrote to
"her dear Theria," that if he could not deliver her by open force, he
might at least kill two out of the four horses of the carriage in which
she was, and thus, at least, get possession of the casket, and throw it
into the fire; otherwise she was lost. Though Theria, of course, received
none of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chère amie</i>'s letters, yet he went of his own accord
to Maestricht, through which she was to pass, and tried to corrupt the
officers by an offer of a thousand pistoles, if they would let her escape;
but they were immovable. All her resources being thus exhausted,
she attempted to kill herself by swallowing a pin; but it was taken
from her by one of her guards.</p>

<p>Among the proofs against her, that which alarmed her the most
was a written confession containing a narrative of her life, kept by her
in the casket which she made such desperate efforts to recover. No
wonder she was now horrified at what she had thus committed to
paper. In the first article she declared herself an incendiary, confessing
that she had set fire to a house. Madame Sevigné, speaking
of this paper, says, "Madame de Brinvillier tells us, in her confession,
that she was debauched at seven years old, and has led an abandoned
life ever since; that she poisoned her father, her brothers, and one of
her children; nay, that she poisoned herself, to try the effect of an
antidote. Medea herself did not do so much. She has acknowledged
this confession to be of her writing,&mdash;a great blunder; but she says
she was in a high fever when she wrote it,&mdash;that it is mere frenzy,&mdash;a
piece of extravagance which no one can read seriously." In a subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
letter, Madame de Sevigné adds, "Nothing is talked of but
the sayings and doings of Madame de Brinvillier. She says in her
confession that she has murdered her father;&mdash;she was afraid, no
doubt, that she might forget to accuse herself of it. The peccadilloes
which she is afraid of forgetting are admirable!"</p>

<p>The proceedings of her trial are fully reported in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Causes Célèbres</i>.
She found an able advocate in the person of M. Nivelle, whose
pleading in her behalf is exceedingly learned and ingenious. He
laboured hard to get rid of the confession; maintaining that this paper
was of the same nature as a confession made under the seal of secrecy
to a priest; and cited a number of precedents to show that circumstances
thus brought to light cannot be used in a criminal prosecution.
Her confused, evasive, and contradictory answers to the
questions put to her on her interrogatory by the court,&mdash;a very objectionable
step, by the way, of French criminal procedure,&mdash;were considered
as filling up the measure of evidence against her; though, in
this case, it was sufficiently ample without the aid either of her confession
or examinations before the judges. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus delicti</i> (in the
language of the law) was certain. The deaths of her two brothers by
poison were proved by the evidence of several medical persons; and
the testimony of other witnesses established the commission of these
crimes by St. Croix and her, through the instrumentality of La
Chaussée.</p>

<p>At length, by a sentence of the supreme criminal court of Paris, on
the 16th of July 1676, Madame de Brinvillier was convicted of the
murder of her father and her two brothers, and of having attempted
the life of her sister, and condemned to make the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende honorable</i>
before the door of the principal church of Paris, whither she was to
be drawn in a hurdle, with her feet bare, a rope about her neck, and
carrying a burning torch in her hands; from thence to be taken to
the Place de Grêve, her head severed from her body on a scaffold,
her body burnt, and her ashes thrown to the wind; after having been,
in the first place, put to the question ordinary and extraordinary, to
discover her accomplices.</p>

<p>Though she had denied her crimes as long as she had any hope of
escape, she confessed everything after condemnation. During the
latter days of her life, she was the sole object of public curiosity. An
immense multitude assembled to see her execution, and every window
on her way to the Place de Grêve was crowded with spectators.
Lebrun, the celebrated painter, placed himself in a convenient situation
for observing her, in order, probably, to make a study for his
"Passions." Among the spectators were many ladies of distinction,
to some of whom, who had got very near her, she said, looking them
firmly in the face, and with a sarcastic smile, "A very pretty sight
you are come to see!"</p>

<p>Madame de Sevigné gives an account of this execution the day it
took place, in a tone of levity which is not a little offensive, and unbecoming
a lady of her unquestionable elegance and refinement.
"Well!" she says, "it is all over, and La Brinvillier is in the air.
Her poor little body was thrown into a large fire, and her ashes scattered
to the winds; so that we breathe her, and there is no saying
but this communication of particles may produce among us some poisoning
propensities which may surprise us. She was condemned yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
This morning her sentence was read to her, and she was
shown the rack; but she said there was no occasion for it, for she
would tell everything. Accordingly she continued till four o'clock
giving a history of her life, which is even more frightful than people
supposed. She poisoned her father ten times successively before she
could accomplish her object; then her brothers; and her revelations
were full of love affairs and pieces of scandal. She asked to speak
with the procureur-général, and was an hour with him; but the subject
of their conversation is not known. At six o'clock she was taken
in her shift, and with a rope round her neck, to Nôtre Dame, to make
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende honorable</i>. She was then replaced in the hurdle, in which
I saw her drawn backwards, with a confessor on one side and the
hangman on the other. It really made me shudder. Those who saw
the execution say she ascended the scaffold with a great deal of courage.
Never was such a crowd seen, nor such excitement and curiosity
in Paris." In another letter the fair writer says, "A word more
about La Brinvillier. She died as she lived, that is boldly. When
she went into the place where she was to undergo the question, and
saw three buckets of water, 'They surely are going to drown me,' she
said; 'for they can't imagine that I am going to drink all this.' She
heard her sentence with great composure. When the reading was
nearly finished, she desired it to be repeated, saying, 'The hurdle
struck me at first, and prevented my attending to the rest.' On her
way to execution she asked her confessor to get the executioner
placed before her, 'that I may not see that scoundrel Desgrais,' she
said, 'who caught me.' Her confessor reproved her for this sentiment,
and she said, 'Ah, my God! I beg your pardon. Let me continue,
then, to enjoy this agreeable sight.' She ascended the scaffold
alone and barefooted, and was nearly a quarter of an hour in being
trimmed and adjusted for the block by the executioner; a piece of
great cruelty which was loudly murmured against. Next day persons
were seeking for her bones, for there was a belief among the people
that she was a saint. She had two confessors, she said; one of whom
enjoined her to tell everything, and the other said it was not necessary.
She laughed at this difference of opinion, and said, 'Very well,
I am at liberty to do as I please.' She did not please to say anything
about her accomplices. Penautier will come out whiter than snow.
The public is by no means satisfied."</p>

<p>This Penautier was a man of wealth and station, holding the office
of treasurer of the province of Languedoc and of the clergy. He was
discovered to have been intimately connected with St. Croix and
Madame de Brinvillier, and strongly suspected of having been a participator
in their crimes. He was accused by the widow of M. de
Saint Laurent, receiver-general of the clergy, of having employed St.
Croix to poison her husband, in order to obtain his place, and of
having accomplished this object by means of a valet whom St. Croix
had got into her husband's service. Penautier was put in prison; but
Madame de Sevigné says that the investigation was stifled by the
influence of powerful protectors, among whom were the Archbishop
of Paris and the celebrated Colbert. In one of her letters she says,
"Penautier is fortunate; never was a man so well protected. He will
get out of this business, but without being justified in the eyes of the
world. Extraordinary things have transpired in the course of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
investigation; but they cannot be mentioned." He was released,
resumed the exercise of his offices, and lived in his former splendour.
The first people had no objection to enjoy his luxurious table; but
his character with the public was irrecoverably gone. Cardinal de
Bonzy, who had to pay some annuities with which his archbishopric
of Narbonne was burdened, survived all the annuitants, and said that,
thanks to his star! he had buried them. Madame de Sevigné, seeing
him one day in his carriage with Penautier, said to a friend, "There
goes the Archbishop of Narbonne with <em>his star</em>!"</p>

<p>The Marquis of Brinvillier is never mentioned in the course of the
proceedings in this extraordinary case, and there are no traces of his
subsequent life. Madame de Sevigné says that he petitioned for the
life of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chère moitié</i>. Wretched as he must have been, he is the less
entitled to sympathy because his own dissolute character contributed
to bring his misfortunes upon himself. He probably spent his latter
days in the deepest retirement, hiding himself from the world, as the
bearer of a name indissolubly associated with crime and infamy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>As I do not intend that any human being shall read this narrative
until after my decease, I feel no desire to suppress or to falsify
any occurrence or event of my life, which I may at the moment
deem of sufficient importance to communicate. I am aware how common
a feeling, even amongst those who have committed the most
atrocious crimes, this dread of entailing obloquy upon their memories
is; but I cannot say that I participate in it. Perhaps I wish
to offer some atonement to society for my many and grievous misdeeds;
and, it may be, the disclosures I am about to make will
be considered an insufficient expiation. I cannot help this, now.
There is One from whom no secrets are hid, by whom I am already
judged.</p>

<p>I regret that I did not execute this wretched task long ago.
Should I live to complete it, I shall hold out longer than I expect;
for I was never ready at my pen, and words sometimes will not come
at my bidding. Besides, so many years have elapsed since the chief
events I am about to relate took place, that even <em>they</em> no longer come
before me with that distinctness which they did formerly. They do
not torture me now, as of old times. The caustic has almost burnt
them out of my soul. I will, however, give a plain, and, as nearly as
I am able, a faithful statement. I will offer no palliation of my offences,
which I do not from my soul believe should be extended to
me.</p>

<p>I was born on the 23rd of October 1787. My father was a
watch-case maker, and resided in a street in the parish of Clerkenwell.
I went a few months ago to look at the house, but it was taken
down; indeed, the neighbourhood had undergone an entire change.
I, too, was somewhat altered since then. I wondered at the time
which of the two was the more so.</p>

<p>My earliest recollection recalls two rooms on a second floor, meanly
furnished; my father, a tall, dark man, with a harsh unpleasing
voice; and my mother, the same gentle, quiet being whom I afterwards
knew her.</p>

<p>My father was a man who could, and sometimes did, earn what
people in his station of life call a great deal of money; and yet he
was constantly in debt, and frequently without the means of subsistence.
The cause of this, I need hardly say, was his addiction to
drinking. Naturally of a violent and brutal temper, intoxication inflamed
his evil passions to a pitch&mdash;not of madness, for he had not
that excuse&mdash;but of frenzy. It is well known that gentleness and
forbearance do not allay, but stimulate a nature like this; and scenes
of violence and unmanly outrage are almost the sole reminiscences of
my childhood. Perhaps, the circumstance of my having been a
sufferer in one of these ebullitions, served to impress them more
strongly upon my mind.</p>

<p>One evening I had been permitted to sit up to supper. My father
had recently made promises of amendment, and had given an earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of his intention by keeping tolerably sober during three entire days;
and upon this festive occasion,&mdash;for it was the anniversary of my mother's
marriage,&mdash;he had engaged to come home the instant he quitted
his work. He returned, however, about one o'clock in the morning,
and in his accustomed state. The very preparations for his comfort,
which he saw upon the table, served as fuel to his savage and intractable
passions. It was in vain that my mother endeavoured to
soothe and to pacify him. He seized a stool on which I was accustomed
to sit, and levelled a blow at her. She either evaded it, or the
aim was not rightly directed, for the stool descended upon my head,
and fractured my skull.</p>

<p>The doctor said it was a miracle that I recovered; and indeed it
was many months before I did so. The unfeeling repulse I experienced
from my father when, on the first occasion of my leaving my
bed, I tottered towards him, I can never forget. It is impossible to
describe the mingled terror and hatred which entered my bosom at
that moment, and which never departed from it. It may appear incredible
to some that a child so young could conceive so intense a
loathing against its own parent. It is true, nevertheless; and, as I
grew, it strengthened.</p>

<p>I will not dwell upon this wretched period of my life; for even
to me, at this moment, and after all that I have done and suffered,
the memory of that time is wretchedness.</p>

<p>One night, about two years afterwards, my father was brought
home on a shutter by two watchmen. He had fallen into the New
River on his return from a public-house in the vicinity of Sadler's
Wells Theatre, and was dragged out just in time to preserve for
the present a worthless and degraded life. A violent cold supervened,
which settled upon his lungs; and, in about a month, the doctor
informed my mother that her husband was in a rapid decline.
The six months that ensued were miserable enough. My mother
was out all day, toiling for the means of subsistence for a man who
was not only ungrateful for her attentions, but who repelled them
with the coarsest abuse.</p>

<p>I was glad when he died, nor am I ashamed to avow it; and I almost
felt contempt for my mother when the poor creature threw herself
upon the body in a paroxysm of grief, calling it by those endearing
names which indicated a love he had neither requited nor deserved.
Had I been so blest as to have met with one to love me as that
woman loved my father, I had been a different, and a better, and,
perhaps, a good man!</p>

<p>"Will you not kiss your poor father, John, and see him for the last
time?" said my mother on the morning of the funeral, as she took
me by the hand.</p>

<p>No; I would not. I was no hypocrite then. It is true I was terrified
at the sight of death, but that was not the cause. The manner
in which he had repulsed me nearly three years before, had never for
a moment departed from my mind. There was not a day on which I
did not brood upon it. I have often since recalled it, and with bitterness.
I remember it now.</p>

<p>My mother had but one relation in the world,&mdash;an uncle, possessed
of considerable property, who resided near Luton, in Bedfordshire.
She applied to him for some small assistance to enable her to pay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
funeral expenses of her husband. Mr. Adams&mdash;for that was her
uncle's name&mdash;sent her two guineas, accompanied by a request that
she would never apply to, or trouble him again. There was, however,
one person who stept forward in this extremity,&mdash;Mr. Ward, a
tradesman, with whom my mother had formerly lived as a servant,
but who had now retired from business. He offered my mother an
asylum in his house. She was to be his housekeeper; and he promised
to take care of, and one day to provide for, me. It was not long
before we were comfortably settled in a small private house in Coppice-row,
where, for the first time in my life, I was permitted to ascertain
that existence was not altogether made up of sorrow.</p>

<p>The old gentleman even conceived a strong liking, it may be called
an affection, for me. He had stood godfather to me at my
birth; and I believe, had I been his own son, he could not have treated
me with more tenderness. He sent me to school, and was delighted
at the progress I made, or appeared to make, which he
protested was scarcely less than wonderful; a notion which the tutor
was, of course, not slow to encourage and confirm. He predicted
that I should inevitably make a bright man, and become a worthy
member of society; the highest distinction, in the old gentleman's
opinion, at which any human being could arrive. Alas! woe to the
child of whom favourable predictions are hazarded! There never yet,
I think, was an instance in which they were not falsified.</p>

<p>We had been residing with Mr. Ward about three years, when a
slight incident occurred which has impressed itself so strongly upon
my memory that I cannot forbear relating it. Mr. Ward had sent
me with a message into the City, where, in consequence of the person
being from home, I was detained several hours. When I returned,
it appeared that Mr. Ward had gone out shortly after me, and had
not mentioned the circumstance of his having despatched me into the
City. I found my mother in a state of violent agitation. She inquired
where I had been, and I told her.</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe you, John," she said; "are you sure you
are telling me the truth?"</p>

<p>I was silent. She repeated the question. I would not answer;
and she bestowed upon me a sound beating.</p>

<p>I bore my punishment with dogged sullenness, and retired into the
back kitchen; in a corner of which I sat down, and, with my head
between my hands, began to brood over the treatment I had received.
Gradually there crept into my heart the same feeling I remembered
to have conceived against my father,&mdash;a feeling of bitter malignity
revived by a fresh object. I endeavoured to quell it, to subdue it, but
I could not. I recalled all my mother's former kindness to me, her
present affection for me; and I reminded myself that this was the
first time she had ever raised her hand against me. This thought
only nourished the feeling, till the aching or my brain caused it to
subside into moody stupefaction.</p>

<p>I became calmer in about an hour, and arose, and went into the
front kitchen. My mother was seated at the window, employed at
her needle; and, as she raised her eyes, I perceived they were red
with weeping. I walked slowly towards her, and stood by her side.</p>

<p>"Mother!" I said, in a low and tremulous voice.</p>

<p>"Well, John; I hope you are a good boy now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother!" I repeated, "you don't know how you have hurt me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry I struck you so hard, child; I did not mean to do it;"
and she averted her head.</p>

<p>"Not that&mdash;not that!" I cried passionately, beating my bosom with
my clenched hands. "It's here, mother&mdash;here. I told you the truth,
and you would not believe me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ward has returned now," said my mother; "I will go ask
him;" and she arose.</p>

<p>I caught her by the gown. "Oh, mother!" I said, "this is the
second time you would not believe me. You shall not go to Mr. Ward
yet!" and I drew her into the seat. "Say first that you are sorry
for it&mdash;only a word. Oh, do say it!"</p>

<p>As I looked up, I saw the tears gathering in her eyes. I fell upon
my knees, and hid my face in her lap. "No, no; don't say anything
now to me&mdash;don't&mdash;don't!" A spasm rose from my chest into my
throat, and I fell senseless at her feet.</p>

<p>My mother afterwards told me that it was the day of the year on
which my father died, and she feared from my lengthened stay that
I had come to harm. Dear, good woman! Oh! that I might hope
to see her once more, even though it were but for one moment,&mdash;for
we shall not meet in heaven!</p>

<p>It was a cruel blow that deprived us of our kind protector!
Mr. Ward died suddenly, and without a will; and my mother and I
were left entirely unprovided with means. The old gentleman had
often declared his intention of leaving my mother enough to render
her comfortable during the remainder of her days, and had expressed
his determination of setting me on in the world immediately I became
of a proper age. It could hardly be expected that the heir-at-law
would have fulfilled these intentions, even had he been cognisant
of them. He was a low attorney, living somewhere in the
neighbourhood of Drury-lane; and when he attended the funeral,
and during the hour or two he remained in the house after it, it
was quite clear that he had no wish to retain anything that belonged
to his late relative except his property, and his valuable and
available effects. He however paid my mother a month's wages
in advance, presented me a dollar to commence the world with,
shook hands with us, and wished us well.</p>

<p>It was not long before my mother obtained a situation as servant
in a small respectable family in King-street, Holborn; and, as I was
now nearly eleven years of age, it was deemed by her friends high
time that I should begin to get my own living. Such small influence,
therefore, as my mother could command, was set on foot in my behalf;
and I at length got a place as errand-boy to a picture-dealer
in Wardour-street, Oxford-street. The duties required of me in this
situation, if not of a valuable description, were, at least, various. I
went with messages, I attended sales, I kept the shop, I cleaned the
knives and shoes, and, indeed, performed all those services which it
is the province of boys to render, some of which are often created
because there happens to be boys to do them.</p>

<p>This routine was, for a time, irksome. When I recalled the happy
days I had spent under the roof of Mr. Ward, and the hopes and expectations
he had excited within me of a more prosperous commencement
of life,&mdash;hopes which his death had so suddenly destroyed,&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
is not surprising that I should have felt a degree of discontent of my
condition, for which I had no other cause. As I sat by the kitchen
fire of an evening when my day's work was done, I often pictured to
myself the old man lying where we had left him in the churchyard,
mouldering insensibly away, unconscious of rain, or wind, or sunshine,
or the coming of night, or the approach of day, wrapped in a shroud
which would outlast its wearer, and silently waiting for oblivion.
These thoughts became less frequent as time wore on; but I have
never been able to dissociate the idea of death from these hideous
conditions of mortality.</p>

<p>My master, Mr. Bromley, when I first entered his service, was a
man of about the middle age, and of rather grave and formal manners.
He had not a bad heart; but I have since discovered that
what appeared to my boyish fancy a hard and cold selfishness was
but the exterior of those narrow prejudices which too many of that
class, if not of all classes, indulge, or rather inherit. He felt that a
distance ought to be preserved between himself and his servant; and
what he thought he ought to do, he always did; so that I had been
with him a considerable period before he even addressed a word to
me which business did not constrain him to utter.</p>

<p>He had a daughter, a girl about eighteen years of age. What a
human being was Louisa Bromley! She was no beauty; but she
had a face whose sweetness was never surpassed. I saw something
like it afterwards in the faces of some of Raffaele's angels. The broad
and serene forehead, the widely-parted eyebrow, the inexplicable
mouth, the soul that pervaded the whole countenance! I can never
forget that face; and, when I call it back to memory now, I admire it
the more because, to use the modern jargon, there was no <em>intellect</em> in it.
There was no thought, no meditation or premeditation; but there
was nature, and it was good-nature.</p>

<p>Her gentleness and kindness soon won upon me. To be kind
to me was at all times the way to win me, and the only way.
I cannot express the happiness I felt at receiving and obeying any
command from her. A smile, or the common courtesy of thanks
from her lips, repaid me a hundred-fold for the performance of the
most menial office.</p>

<p>I had now been with Mr. Bromley about four years. I employed
my leisure, of which I had a great deal, in reading. All the books I
could contrive to borrow, or that fell in my way, I devoured greedily.
Nor did I confine myself exclusively to one branch of reading,&mdash;I
cannot call it study. But my chief delight was to peruse the lives of
the great masters of painting, to make myself acquainted with the
history and the comparative merits of their several performances, and
to endeavour to ascertain how many and what specimens existed in
this country. I had, also, a natural taste for painting, and sometimes
surprised my master by the remarks I ventured to make upon productions
he might happen to purchase, or which had been consigned
to him for sale.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was permitted to go out in the afternoon of each alternate
Sunday. Upon these occasions I invariably went to see my
mother. How well can I remember the gloomy underground kitchen
in which I always found her, with her Bible before her on a small
round table! With what pleased attention did she listen to me when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
I descanted on the one subject upon which I constantly dwelt,&mdash;the
determination I felt, as soon as I had saved money enough, and could
see a little more clearly into my future prospects, to take her from service,
that she might come and live with me! This was, in truth, the
one absorbing thought&mdash;it might almost be termed the one passion&mdash;of
my existence at that time. I had no other hope, no other feeling,
than that of making her latter years a compensation for the misery
she must have endured during my father's life.</p>

<p>One Sunday when I called, as usual, an old woman answered the
door. She speedily satisfied my inquiries after my mother. She had
been very ill for some days, and was compelled to keep her bed. My
heart sank within me. I had seen her frequently in former years disfigured
by her husband's brutality; I had seen her in pain, in anguish,
which she strove to conceal; but I had never known her to be
confined to her room. When I saw her now, young as I was, and unaccustomed
to the sight of disease, I involuntarily shrunk back with
horror. She was asleep. I watched her for a few minutes, and then
stole softly from the room, and returned to my master's house.</p>

<p>He was gone to church with his daughter. I followed thither, and
waited under the portico till they came forth. I quickly singled them
out from the concourse issuing from the church-doors. I drew my
master aside, and besought him to spare me for a few days, that I
might go and attend my mother, who was very ill.</p>

<p>"Is she dying?" he inquired.</p>

<p>I started. "No, not dying. Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Well, John, I can't spare you: we are very busy now, you
know."</p>

<p>And what was that to me? It is only on occasions like these, that
the value of one's services is recognised. I thought of this at the
time. I turned, in perplexity, to Louisa Bromley. She understood
the silent appeal, and interceded for me. I loved her for that; I
could have fallen down at her feet, and kissed them for it. She prevailed
upon the old man to let me go.</p>

<p>The people of the house at which my mother was a servant were
kind, and even friendly. They permitted me to remain with her.</p>

<p>I never left her side for more than half an hour at a time. She
grew worse rapidly, but I would not believe it. My mother, however,
was fully aware of her situation. She told me frequently, with
a smile, which I could not bear to see upon her face, it was so unlike
joy, but it was to comfort me,&mdash;she told me that she knew she was
about to die, and she endeavoured to impress upon me those simple
maxims of conduct for my future life which she had herself derived
from her parents. She must not die&mdash;must not; and I heard with
impatience, and heedlessly, the advice she endeavoured to bestow
upon me.</p>

<p>She died. The old nurse told me she was dead. It could not be,&mdash;she
was asleep. My mother had told me not an hour before, that
she felt much better, and wanted a little sleep; and at that moment
her hand was clasped in mine. The lady of the house took me gently
by the arm, and, leading me into an adjoining room, began to talk
to me in a strain, I suppose, usually adopted upon such occasions,&mdash;for
I knew not what she said to me.</p>

<p>In about two hours I was permitted to see my mother again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
There was a change&mdash;a frightful change! The nurse, I remember,
said something about her looking like one asleep. I burst into a loud
laugh. Asleep! that blank, passive, impenetrable face like sleep&mdash;petrified
sleep! I enjoined them to leave me, and they let me have
my own way; for, boy as I was, they were frightened at me.</p>

<p>I took my mother's hand, and wrung it violently. I implored her
to speak to me once more, to repeat that she still loved me, to tell
me that she forgave all my faults, all my omissions, all my sins towards
her. And then I knew she <em>was</em> dead, and fell down upon my
knees to pray; but I could not. Something told me that I ought not&mdash;something
whispered that I ought rather to&mdash;&mdash;; but I was struck
senseless upon the floor.</p>

<p>The mistress of my mother, who was a good and worthy woman,
offered to pay her funeral expenses; but I would not permit it. Not
a farthing would I receive from her; out of my own savings I buried
her.</p>

<p>If I could have wept&mdash;but I never could weep&mdash;when this calamity
befell me, I think that impious thought would never have entered my
brain. That thought was, that the Almighty was unjust to deprive
me of the only being in the world who loved me, who understood me,
who knew that I had a heart, and that, when it was hurt and outraged,
my head was not safe&mdash;not to be trusted. That thought remained
with me for years.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>Five years elapsed. The grief occasioned by my mother's death
having in some measure subsided, my thoughts became concentrated
upon myself with an intensity scarcely to be conceived. A new passion
took possession of my soul: I would distinguish myself, if possible,
and present to the world another instance of friendless poverty
overcoming and defying the obstacles and impediments to its career.
With this view constantly before me, I read even more diligently
than heretofore. I made myself a proficient in the principles of mathematics;
I acquired some knowledge of mechanical science; but,
above all, I took every opportunity of improving my taste in the
fine arts. This last accomplishment was soon of infinite service to
me; many gentlemen who frequented our shop were pleased to take
much notice of me; my master was frequently rallied upon having a
servant who knew infinitely more of his business than himself; and
my opinion on one or two remarkable occasions was taken in preference
to that of my employer.</p>

<p>Mr. Bromley naturally and excusably might have conceived no
slight envy of my acquirements; but he was not envious. Shall I be
far wrong when I venture to say, that few men are so, where pecuniary
interest points out the impolicy of their encouraging that feeling?
Be this as it may, he treated me with great kindness; and I
was grateful for it, really and strongly so. I had been long since
absolved from the performance of those menial duties which had been
required of me when I first entered his service; my wages were increased
to an extent which justified me in calling them by the more
respectable term, salary; I was permitted to live out of the house;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and in all respects the apparent difference and distance between my
master and myself were sensibly diminished.</p>

<p>During this period of five years I never received one unkind word
or look from Louisa Bromley: and the affection I bore towards this
young woman, which was the affection a brother might have felt,
caused me to strive by every means at my command to advance the
fortunes of her father. And, indeed, the old man had become so attached
to me,&mdash;partly, and I doubt not unconsciously, because my
talents were of value to him,&mdash;that I should not have had the heart,
even had my inclinations prompted me, to desert him. It is certain
that I might have improved my own position by doing so.</p>

<p>At this time Frederick Steiner became acquainted with Mr. Bromley.
He was a young man about thirty years of age, of German descent,
and possessed of some property. The manners of Steiner
were plausible, he was apparently candid, his address indicated frankness
and entire absence of guile, and he was handsome; yet I never
liked the man. It is commonly supposed that women are gifted with
the power of detecting the worst points of the characters of men at
the first glance. This gift is withheld when they first behold the man
they are disposed to love. This, at any rate, was the case with
Louisa Bromley.</p>

<p>Not to dwell upon this part of my narrative, in a few months Bromley's
daughter was married to Steiner, who was taken into partnership.</p>

<p>I must confess I was deeply mortified at this. I myself had conceived
hopes of one day becoming Bromley's partner; and my anxiety
for the happiness of his daughter led me to doubt whether she had
not made a choice which she might have occasion afterwards to deplore.
However, things went on smoothly for a time. Steiner was
civil, nay, even friendly to me; and the affection he evinced towards
his little boy, who was born about a year after the marriage, displayed
him in so amiable a light, that I almost began to like the man.</p>

<p>It was not very long, however, before Steiner and I came to understand
each other more perfectly. He was possessed with an overweening
conceit of his taste in pictures, and I on my part obstinately
adhered to my own opinion, whenever I was called upon to pronounce
one. This led to frequent differences, which commonly ended in a
dispute, which Bromley was in most cases called upon to decide. The
old man, doubtless, felt the awkwardness of his position; but, as his
interest was inseparable from a right view of the question at issue,
he commonly decided with me.</p>

<p>Upon these occasions Steiner vented his mortification in sneers at
my youth, and ironical compliments to me upon my cleverness and
extraordinary genius; for both of which requisites, as he was signally
deficient in them, he especially hated me. I could have repaid his
hatred with interest, for I kept it by me in my own bosom, and it accumulated
daily.</p>

<p>I know not how it happened that the child wound itself round my
heart, but it was so. It seemed as though there were a necessity
that, in proportion as I detested Steiner, I must love his child. But
the boy, from the earliest moment he could take notice of anything,
or could recognise anybody, had attached himself to me; and I loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
him, perhaps for that cause, with a passionate fondness which I can
scarcely imagine to be the feeling even of a parent towards his child.</p>

<p>If I were not slow by nature to detect the first indications of incipient
estrangement, I think I should have perceived in less than two
years after Steiner had been taken into partnership by Mr. Bromley, a
growing reserve, an uneasy constraint in the manners of the latter,
and a studied, an almost formal civility on the part of his daughter.
I now think there must have been something of the kind, although it
was not at the time apparent to me. I am certain, at all events, there
was less cordiality, less friendship, in the deportment of Mrs. Steiner
towards me: a circumstance which I remember to have considered
the result of her altered situation. The terms of almost social equality,
however, were no longer observed.</p>

<p>One Mr. Taylor, a very extensive picture-dealer, who lived in the
Haymarket, made several overtures to me about this time. He had
heard many gentlemen of acknowledged taste speak of me in the
highest terms; and, in truth, I was now pretty generally recognised
throughout the trade as one of the best judges of pictures in London.
I had more than one interview, of his own seeking, with this gentleman.
He made me a most flattering and advantageous offer: he
would have engaged my services for a certain number of years, and at
the expiration of the period he would have bound himself to take me
into partnership. I had received many similar offers before, although
none that could be for a moment compared, on the score of emolument
and stability, with this. I rejected those for the sake of Bromley:
I rejected this for my own.</p>

<p>Shall I be weak enough to confess it? The respect I bore the old
man even now; my affection for his daughter, my love for the child,
went some part of the way towards a reason for declining Taylor's
proposal; but it did not go all the way. I hated Steiner so intensely,
so mortally, and he supplied me daily with such additional cause of
hatred, that I felt a species of excitement, of delight, in renewing
from time to time my altercations with him: a delight which was
considerably increased by the fact that he was quite incapable of
competing with me in argument. There was another reason, which
added a zest, if anything could do so, to the exquisite pleasure I derived
from tormenting him,&mdash;the belief I entertained that Bromley
and himself dared not part with me: they knew my value too well.
Bromley, at least, I was well aware, was conscious enough of that.</p>

<p>I had been attending one day a sale of pictures, the property of a
certain nobleman whose collection, thirty years ago, was the admiration
of connoisseurs. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (I need not give his name, but
he is still living,) had employed me to bid for several amongst the
collection; and had requested my opinion of a few, the merit of which,
although strongly insisted upon, he was disposed to doubt. When I
returned in the evening, I saw Steiner in the shop waiting for me, and&mdash;for
hate is quick at these matters, quicker even than love&mdash;I knew
that he meditated a quarrel. I was not mistaken. He looked rather
pale, and his lip quivered slightly.</p>

<p>"And so," said he, "you have been holding several conversations
with Mr. Taylor lately; haven't you, Mr. Gibson?"</p>

<p>"Who told you that I had been holding conversations with him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"No matter: you have done so. Pray, may I ask the tenour of
them?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor wished to engage my services," I replied, "and I declined
to leave Mr. Bromley."</p>

<p>"That's not very likely," said Steiner with a sneer.</p>

<p>Steiner was right there; it was not very likely. He might with
justice consider me a fool for not having embraced the offer.</p>

<p>"I suppose," pursued Steiner in the same tone, "Mr. &mdash;&mdash; would
follow you to your new situation. You would select his pictures for
him as usual, doubtless."</p>

<p>"Doubtless I should," said I with a cool smile that enraged him.
"Mr. &mdash;&mdash; would follow <em>me</em> certainly, and many others would follow
<em>him</em>, Mr. Steiner."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is," cried Steiner, and a flush overspread his
face; "Taylor has been using you for his own purposes. You have
been endeavouring to undermine our connexion, and have been serving
him at the same time that you have taken our wages."</p>

<p>It was not a difficult matter at any time to move me to anger. I
approached him, and with a glance of supreme scorn replied, "It is
false!&mdash;nay, I don't fear you&mdash;it's a lie,&mdash;an infamous lie!"</p>

<p>Steiner was a very powerful man, and in the prime of manhood; I
was young, and my limbs were not yet fixed,&mdash;not set. He struck
me a violent blow on the face. I resisted as well as I was able; but
what can weakness do against strength, even though it have justice on
its side? He seized me by the cravat, and, forcing his knuckles
against my throat, dealt me with the other hand a violent blow on the
temple, and felled me to the earth. O that I had never risen from it!
It had been better.</p>

<p>When I came to my senses, for the blow had for a while stunned
me, I arose slowly, and with difficulty. Steiner was still standing
over me in malignant triumph, and I could see in the expression of
his eyes the gratified conviction he felt of having repaid the long
score of ancient grudges in which he was indebted to me. His wife
was clinging to his arm, and as I looked into her face I perceived
terror in it, certainly; but there was no sympathy,&mdash;nay, that is not
the word,&mdash;I could not have borne that; there was no sorrow, no
interest, no concern about me. My heart sickened at this. Bromley
was there also. He appeared slightly perplexed; and, misconceiving
the meaning of my glance, said coldly, but hurriedly, "You brought
it entirely upon yourself, Mr. Gibson."</p>

<p>I turned away, and walked to the other end of the shop for my hat.
I had put it on, and was about leaving them. As I moved towards
the door, I was nearly throwing down the little boy, who had followed
me, and was now clinging to the skirt of my coat, uttering in imperfect
accents my name. I looked down. The little thing wanted to
come to me to kiss me. Sweet innocent! there was one yet in the
world to love me. I would have taken the child in my arms; but
Mrs. Steiner exclaimed abruptly, "Come away, Fred,&mdash;do; I insist
upon it, sir." From that time, and for a long time, I hated the woman
for it.</p>

<p>I retreated to my lodging, and slunk to my own room with a sense
of abasement, of degradation, of infamy, I had never felt before. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Matthews, the woman of the house, who had answered the door to
me, and had perceived my agitation, followed me up stairs. She inquired
the cause, and was greatly shocked at the frightful contusion
upon my temple. I told her all, for my heart was nigh bursting, and
would be relieved. She hastened down stairs for an embrocation,
which the good woman had always by her, and, returning with it, began
to bathe my forehead.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I trounce the villain for it," she said, as she continued
to apply the lotion.</p>

<p>"What did you say, Mrs. Matthews?" and I suddenly looked up.</p>

<p>"Why, that I'd have the rascal punished,&mdash;that's what I said.
Hanging's too good for such a villain."</p>

<p>The kind creature&mdash;I was a favourite of hers&mdash;talked a great deal
more to the same effect, and at last left me to procure a bottle of
rum, which, much to her surprise, for I was no drinker, I requested
her to fetch me.</p>

<p>How exquisite it was,&mdash;what a luxury to be left alone all to myself!
Punished!&mdash;the woman had said truly,&mdash;he must be punished. They,
too, must not escape. The ingratitude of the old man,&mdash;his insolence
of ingratitude was almost as bad as the conduct of Steiner. After
what I had done for him!&mdash;an old servant who had indeed served
him!&mdash;who had refused a certainty, a respectable station in society,
perhaps a fortune, for his sake! And he must escape,&mdash;he must go
unpunished,&mdash;he must revel in the consciousness of the impunity of
his insult? <em>No.</em> I swore that deeply; and, lest it should be possible
that I could falter, or perhaps renounce my intention, I confirmed
that oath with another, which I shudder to think of, and must not
here set down.</p>

<p>I emptied the bottle of rum, but I was not drunk. When I went
to bed I was as sober as I am at this moment. I did not go to bed to
sleep. My senses were in a strange ferment. The roof of my head
seemed to open and shut, and I fancied I could hear the seething of
my brain below. I presently fell into a kind of stupor.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when I recovered from this swoon, and I
started from the bed to my feet. Something had been whispering in
my ear, and I listened for a moment in hideous expectation that the
words&mdash;for I did hear words&mdash;would be repeated; but all was silent.
I struck a light, and after a time became more composed. Even the
furniture of the room was company to me. Before morning I had
shaped my plan of revenge, and it was in accordance with the words
that had been spoken to me. Oh, my God! what weak creatures we
are! This fantasy possessed, pervaded me; it did not grow,&mdash;it did
not increase from day to day,&mdash;it came, and it overcame me.</p>

<p>I returned the next morning to Bromley's house, and requested to
see Steiner. I apologised to him for the words I had used on the
previous day, and requested to be permitted to remain in my situation,
if Mr. Bromley would consent to it, until I could turn myself
round; and I hoped, in the mean time, that what had taken place
would be overlooked and forgotten. Steiner received me with a kind
of civil arrogance, and went to confer with his partner. They presently
returned together, and my request, after an admonitory lecture,
rather confusedly delivered, from Bromley, was acceded to;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Steiner warning me at the same time to conduct myself with more
humility for the future, under pain of similar punishment.</p>

<p>I did do so, and for six months nothing could exceed the attention
I paid to business, the zeal I evinced upon every occasion, the forbearance
I exercised under every provocation. And I had need of
forbearance. Bromley had been entirely perverted by his son-in-law;
and the kind old man of former years was changed into a morose and
almost brutal blackguard&mdash;to me,&mdash;only to me. Mrs. Steiner had
likewise suffered the influence of her husband to undermine, and for
the time to destroy her better feelings; and she treated me upon all
occasions, not merely with marked coldness, but with positive insult.
I need hardly say that Steiner enjoyed almost to satiety the advantage
he had gained over me. Even the very servants of the house
took the cue from their superiors, and looked upon me with contempt
and disdain. The little boy alone, who had received express commands
never to speak to me, sometimes found his way into the shop,
and as he clung round my neck, and bestowed unasked kisses upon my
cheek, my hatred of the rest swelled in my bosom almost to bursting.</p>

<p>The persecution I endured thus long was intense torment to me;
the reader, whoever he may be, will probably think so. He will be
mistaken. It was a source of inconceivable, of exquisite pleasure.
It was a justification to me; it almost made the delay of my vengeance
appear sinful.</p>

<p>It was now the 22nd of December 1808. I cannot refrain from
recording the date. Steiner had been during the last six weeks at
Antwerp, and was expected to return in a day or two. He had purchased
at a sale in that city a great quantity of pictures, which had
just arrived, and were now in the shop. They were severally of no
great value, but the purchase had brought Bromley's account at the
banker's to a very low ebb. Mrs. Steiner and the child were going
to spend the Christmas holidays with some relatives residing at Canterbury.
She passed through the shop silently and without even noticing
me, and hurried the boy along lest he should wish&mdash;and he did
make an effort to do so&mdash;to take his farewell of me. It was evening
at the time, and Bromley was in his back parlour. I was busy in the
shop that evening; it was business of my own, which I transacted secretly.
Having completed it, I did what was rather unusual with me;
I opened the door of the parlour, and bade Bromley good night.</p>

<p>All that evening I hovered about the neighbourhood. I had not
resolution to go from it. Now that the time was come when I should
be enabled, in all human probability, to fulfil, to glut my vengeance,
my heart failed me. The feeling which had supported me during
the last six months, which had been more necessary to my soul than
daily sustenance to my body, had deserted me then, but that by a
powerful effort I contrived to retain it. While I deplored having returned
to Bromley's employment, and the abject apology I had made
to Steiner, that very step and its consequences made it impossible
for me to recede. It must be. It was my fate to do it, and it was
theirs that it should be done.</p>

<p>What trivial incidents cling to the memory sometimes, when they
are linked by association to greater events! I was, I remember
standing at the door of a small chandler's shop in Dean-street, almost
lost to myself, and to all that was passing about me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman of the house tapped me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Will you be so good," she said, "as to move on; you are preventing
my customers from entering the shop."</p>

<p>"My good woman," I said, "I hope there is no harm in my standing
here?"</p>

<p>"Not much harm," replied the woman, good-humouredly. "I hope
you have been doing nothing worse to-day?"</p>

<p>I started, and gazed at the woman earnestly. She smiled.</p>

<p>"Why, bless the man! you look quite flurried. I haven't offended
you, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" I muttered hastily, and moved away. The agony I endured
for the next hour I cannot describe.</p>

<p>I passed Bromley's house several times from the hour of nine till
half-past. All was silent, all still. What if my design should not
take effect! I almost hoped that it would not; and yet the boy who
cleaned out the shop must inevitably discover it in the morning. I
trembled at the contemplation of that, and my limbs were overspread
with a clammy dew. It was too late to make a pretext of
business in the shop at that time of night. Bromley was at home,
and might, nay would, suspect me. I resolved to be on the premises
the first thing in the morning, and retired in a state of mind to
which no subsequent occurrence of my life was ever capable of
reducing me.</p>

<p>It was about half-past eleven o'clock, or nearer to twelve, that
the landlord of the Green Man, in Oxford-street, entered the parlour
where I was sitting, gazing listlessly upon two men who were playing
a game at dominos.</p>

<p>"There is a dreadful fire," said he, "somewhere on the other side
of the street;&mdash;in Berwick or Wardour-street, I think."</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet, and rushed out of the house, and, turning into
Hanway-yard, ran down Tottenham-court road, crossed the fields,
(they are now built upon,) and never stopped till I reached Pancras
Church.</p>

<p>As I leaned against the wall of the churchyard some men came
along.</p>

<p>"Don't you see the fire, master?" said one, as they passed me.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, I did see the fire, tingeing the clouds with
a lurid and dusky red, and at intervals casting a shower of broken
flame into the air, which expanded itself in wide-spreading scintillations.</p>

<p>God of Heaven! what had I done? Why was I here? I lived in
the neighbourhood of Bromley's house, and they would be sending
for me. The landlord, too, would afterwards remember having seen
me in his parlour, and informing me of the fire in the neighbourhood,
and I should be discovered. These thoughts were the duration of a
moment, but they decided me. I ran back again in a frenzy of remorse
and terror, and in a few minutes was in Wardour-street.</p>

<p>The tumult and confusion were at their height. The noise of the
engines, the outcries of the firemen, the uproar of the crowd, faintly
shadowed forth the tumult in my mind at that moment. I made my
way through the dense mass in advance of me, and at length reached
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Bromley had just issued from it, and was wringing his hands, and
stamping his naked feet upon the pavement. He recognised me, and
seized me wildly by the arms.</p>

<p>"Oh! my good God! Gibson," said he, "my child!"</p>

<p>"What child&mdash;what child?" cried I, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Mine&mdash;mine! and the infant! they are in there!"</p>

<p>"They are gone out of town; don't you remember?" I thought
the sudden fright had deprived him of his senses.</p>

<p>"No, no, no! they were too late! the coach was gone!"</p>

<p>With a loud scream I dashed the old man from me, and flew to the
door, which was open. I made my way through the stifling smoke
that seemed almost to block up the passage, and sprang up stairs.
The bed-room door was locked. With a violent effort I wrenched
off the lock, and rushed into the room.</p>

<p>All was darkness; but presently a huge tongue of flame swept
through the doorway, and, running up the wall, expanded upon the
ceiling; and then I saw a figure in white darting about the room
with angular dodgings like a terrified bird in a cage.</p>

<p>"Where is the child?" I exclaimed, in a voice of frenzy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Steiner knew me, and ran towards me, clasping me with
both arms. She shook her head wildly, and pointed she knew not
where.</p>

<p>"Here, Gibson,&mdash;here," cried the child, who had recognised my
voice.</p>

<p>I threw off my coat immediately, and, seizing the boy, wrapt him
closely in it.</p>

<p>"This way, madam,&mdash;this way; at once, for Heaven's sake!" and
I dragged her to the landing.</p>

<p>There was hell about me then! The flames, the smoke, the fire,
the howlings; it was a living hell! But there was a shriek at that
moment! Mrs. Steiner had left my side. Gracious Heavens! she
had been precipitated below! A sickness came upon me then,&mdash;a
sensation of being turned sharply round by some invisible power; and,
with the child tightly clasped in my arms, I was thrown violently forward
into the flames, that seemed howling and yearning to devour
me.</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="MASCALBRUNI" id="MASCALBRUNI"></a>MASCALBRUNI.</h2>


<p>I have frequently observed that there are some people who haunt
you in all parts of the world, and to whom you have a sort of secret
antipathy, yet who, by an attraction in spite of repulsion, are continually
crossing your path, as though they were sent as emissaries to
link themselves with your destiny, or on the watch mysteriously to
bring it about. One person in particular, whose name I do not even
know, if he has one, I have met fifty times in as many different
places, and we each say to ourselves, "'Tis he!&mdash;what, again!" So
with a personage too well known at home and abroad, of whom, by a
curious concatenation of circumstances, I am enabled to become the
biographer.</p>

<p>Geronymo Mascalbruni was the son of a pauper belonging to a village
whose name I forget, in the marshes of Ancona. He had begged
his way when a boy to Rome, and supported himself for some time
there, by attending at the doors of the courts of justice, and running
on errands for the advocates or the suitors. His intelligence and
adroitness did not escape the observation of one of the attorneys, who,
wanting a lad of all work, took Mascalbruni into his service, and
taught him to read and write; finding him useful in his office, and
having no children of his own, he at length adopted him, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in formâ
pauperis</i>, and gave him a small share in his business. This man of
the law did not bear the most exemplary of characters, and perhaps
it was in order to conceal some nefarious practices to which Mascalbruni
was privy that he made the clerk his associate. Perhaps also
he discovered in his character a hardihood, combined with cunning
and chicanery, that made him a ready instrument for his purposes,
and thus enabled him, like Teucer, to fight behind the shield of another.
Under this worthy master&mdash;a worthy disciple&mdash;Mascalbruni
continued for some years; till at length, tired of confinement to the
desk, and having the taste early acquired for a roving and profligate
life revived, he, during his old benefactor's confinement to his bed
with a rheumatic attack, administered to him a dose of poison instead
of medicine, and having robbed him of all the money and
plate that was portable, and of certain <em>coupons</em>, and <em>bons</em> in the Neapolitan
and other funds, standing in his name, he decamped, and
reached Florence in safety.</p>

<p>Every one has heard of the laxity of the Roman police. The impunity
of offenders, even when their crimes are established by incontestable
proof, is notorious. The relations of the lawyer, contrary to
all their expectations, (for he had never recognised them,) had come
into their inheritance, and little regarded the means, having attained
the end. They perhaps, also, from having had no admission into the
house during the old miser's life, were ignorant of the strength of his
coffers; and the disappearance of the murderer, who, by a will which
they discovered and burnt, had been made his sole heir, was by them
deemed too fortunate a circumstance; so that they neither inquired
into the manner of his death, nor had any <em>post mortem</em> examination
of the body. They gave their respectable relative a splendid funeral,
erected to his memory a tomb in one of the rival churches that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
front the Piazza del Popolo, in which his many virtues were not forgotten,
and established an annual mass for his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">povera anima</i>, that no
doubt saved him</p>

<p class="linequot">"From many a peck of purgatorial coals."</p>

<p>Having quietly inurned the master, let us follow the man. The
sum which he carried with him is not exactly known, but it must
have been considerable. His stay in the Tuscan state was short,
and we find him with his ill-gotten wealth in "that common sewer
of London and of Rome," Paris. He was then about twenty years of
age, had a good person, talents, an insinuating address, and a sufficient
knowledge of the world, at least of the worst part of mankind, to avoid
sinking in that quagmire, which has swallowed up so many of the
thoughtless and inexperienced who have trusted to its flattering surface.
In fact, Nature seemed to have gifted him with the elements
of an accomplished sharper, and he seconded her attributes by all
the resources of art. He took an apartment in the Rue Neuve de
Luxembourg, that street so admirably situated between the Boulevards
and the Gardens of the Tuileries, and had engraven on his
cards, "Il Marchese Mascalbruni." He was attached to his name;
it was a good, sonorous, well-sounding name; and the addition of
Marchese dovetailed well, and seemed as though it had always, or
ought always, to have belonged to it.</p>

<p>But before he made his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i> in the world of Paris, he was aware
that he had much to learn; and, with the tact and nice sense of
observation and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">disinvoltura nel maneggiar</i> peculiar to his nature,
he soon set about accomplishing himself in the externals of a gentleman.
With this view he passed several hours a day in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle
d'armes</i>, where he made himself a first-rate fencer; and became so
dexterous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au tir</i>, that he could at the extremity of the gallery hit the
bull's-eye of the target at almost every other shot.</p>

<p>Pushkin himself was not more dexterous; and, like him, our hero in
the course of his career signalised himself by several rencontres
which proved fatal to his antagonists, into the details of but one of
which I shall enter. He heard that nothing gives a young man
greater <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> at starting into society than a duel. Among those who
frequented the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle</i> was an old officer who had served in the campaigns
of Napoleon, one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reliquiæ Danaum</i>, the few survivors of
Moscow; for those who did not perish on the road, mostly fell victims
to the congelations and fatigues of that memorable retreat.
Mascalbruni, now a match for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d'armes</i>, frequently exercised
with this old <em>grognard</em>, who had the character of being a <em>crane</em>,
if not a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourreau des cranes</i>;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and one day, before a numerous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gallerie</i>,
having struck the foil out of his hand, the fencer so far forgot
himself, in the shame and vexation of defeat by a youngster, as to
pick up the weapon and strike the Italian a blow on the shoulders
with the flat part of the foil, if it be not an Irishism so to call it. Those
who saw Mascalbruni at that moment would not have forgotten the
traits of his countenance. His eyes flashed with a sombre fire; his
Moorish complexion assumed a darker hue, as the blood rushed from
his heart to his brain in an almost suffocating tide; his breath came
forth in long and audible expirations; his features were convulsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
with the rage of a demoniac. I only describe what Horace Verney,
who was present, faithfully sketched from memory after the scene.
Mascalbruni, tearing off the button of his foil, vociferated, putting
himself in position, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A la mort, à la mort!</i>" The lookers-on were
panic-stricken; but the silence was interrupted by the clinking of the
steel. The aggressor soon lay stretched in the agonies of death.</p>

<p>Though he had now taken his first degree, Mascalbruni's education
was not yet complete. He had made himself master of French, so as
to speak it almost without any of the accent of a foreigner; and having
a magnificent voice, he added to it all the science that one of his
own countrymen could supply, and became in the end a finished musician
and vocalist.</p>

<p>Such was the course of his studies; and now, with all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préstige</i>
of his singular <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affaire</i> to give him <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>, the Marchese Mascalbruni
made his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i>. By way of recreation, he had frequently gone into
the gambling-houses of the Palais Royal, and had been much struck
with these words, almost obliterated, on the walls of one of them,
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tutus veni, tutus abi.</i>" Mascalbruni was determined to profit by the
advice, and to confirm its truth by one solitary exception&mdash;to come
and depart in safety, or rather a winner.</p>

<p>Mascalbruni invented a theory of his own, that has since been practised
by several of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</i> of the hells, particularly by a man denominated,
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maisons de jeu</i>, L'Avocat. He won such enormous
sums of the bank, that, on his return to his lodgings one night, he
was assassinated, not without suspicion that he fell by the hands of
some kind bravo of the company. <em>Chi lo sa?</em> But to revert to Mascalbruni.</p>

<p><em>Impares numeri</em> are said to be fortunate: strange to say, the number
three is the most so. Three was a mystic number. The triangle
was sacred to the Hindoos and Egyptians. There were three Graces,
three Furies, three Fates. He played a martingale of one, three,
seven, fifteen, &amp;c. on triple numbers, <em>i. e.</em> after three of a colour,
either red or black, had come up, and not till then, he played,
and opposed its going a fourth; thus rendering it necessary that
there should be twelve or thirteen successive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coups</i> of four, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et sequentia</i>,
without the intervention of a three. The gain, it is true,
could not be great, for he began with a five-franc piece: but it
seemed sure; and so he found it, making a daily profit of three or
four louis in as many hours.</p>

<p>I have gone into this dry subject to show the character of the
man, and his imperturbable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</i>. He did not, however, confine
himself to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge et noir</i>, but soon learned all the niceties
of that scientific game <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écarté</i>. In addition to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauter le coup</i>, which
he practised with an invisible dexterity, he used to file the ends
of the fingers of his right hand, so that he could feel the court-cards,
which, having a thicker coat of paint, are thus made easily
sensible to the touch; and would extract from each pack one
or two, the knowledge of whose non-existence was no slight advantage
in discarding. He did not long wait for associates in his art.
There was formed at that time a club in the Rue Richelieu on the
principle of some of the English clubs, it being entirely managed by a
committee. Of this he became a member, and afterwards got an
introduction at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i>. Most of the English at Paris joined this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
circle; and it was broken up in consequence of the discovery of man&oelig;uvres
and sleights of hand such as I have described, but not until
Mascalbruni had contrived to bear away a more than equal share of
the plunder. The English, of course, were the great sufferers.</p>

<p>He now turned his face towards the Channel, and opened the campaign
in London on a much more extensive scale. He took up his
quarters at Higginbottom's hotel in the same year that young Napoleon
came to England, and only left it when it was given up to
that lamented and accomplished prince. It is not generally known
that he ever visited England. His sojourn in the capital was kept
a profound secret. The master of the hotel and all his servants
took an oath of secrecy; and Prince Esterhazy and the members
of the Austrian embassy were not likely to betray it. The prince
passed a week with George the Fourth at the Cottage at Windsor,
and afterwards assisted at a concert at the Hanover Square rooms,
himself leading a concert on the piano. This by the bye. Mascalbruni
on that occasion attracted all eyes, and fascinated all ears, and
was greeted after a solo with the loudest plaudits. He had now become
the fashion, and, having forged a letter from one of the cardinals
at Rome to a patroness of Almacks, obtained the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i>, and
made one of the three hundred that compose the world of London.
You know, however, in this world that there is another world&mdash;orb
within orb&mdash;an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium in imperio</i>&mdash;the Exclusives. It is difficult
to define what the qualifications for an exclusive are: it is not rank,
connexion, talents, virtues, grace, elegance, accomplishments. No.
But I shall not attempt to explain the inexplicable. Certain it is,
however, that our hero was admitted into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coteries</i> of this caste,
as distinct&mdash;as much separated by a line of demarcation drawn round
them from the rest&mdash;as the Rajhpoot is from the Raiot, who sprang,
one from the head, the other from the heels of Brahma.</p>

<p>It was on the daughter of one of these extra-exclusives that Mascalbruni
cast his eye. He flew at high game. The Honourable Miss
M. was the belle of the season. I remember seeing her the year
before at a fancy ball. A quadrille had been got up, for which were
selected twelve of the most beautiful girls to represent the twelve
Seasons. Louisa was May, and excelled the rest, (I do not speak of
the present year,) as much as that season of flowers does the other
months. It was an 'incarnation of May!'&mdash;a metaphor of Spring,
and Youth, and Morning!&mdash;a rose-bud just opening its young leaves,
that brings the swiftest thought of beauty, though words cannot embody
it:&mdash;a sylph borne by a breath, a zephyr, as in the celebrated
Hebe of John of Bologna, may make intelligible the lightness of her
step,&mdash;the ethereal grace of her form. She was a nymph of Canova,
without her affectation. Hers was the poetry of motion,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p>Louisa M. was the only daughter of an Irish bishop. His see
was one of the most valuable in the sister island; and some idea may
be formed of his accumulated wealth, by the circumstance of his
having received thirty thousand pounds in one year by fines on the
renewal of leases. He had one son, then on a Continental tour with
his tutor; but having no entailed estates, and his fortune consisting
of ready money, Louisa was probably one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">meilleures parties</i> in
the three kingdoms.</p>

<p>There was at that time a mania for foreign alliances. The grand
tour, which almost every family of distinction had taken, introduced a
rage for Continental customs and manners, which had in some degree
superseded our own.</p>

<p>A spring in Paris, and winter in Italy, left behind them regrets in
the minds of old and young, but especially the latter, who longed to
return to those scenes that had captivated their senses and seduced
their young imaginations. No language was spoken at the opera but
French or Italian,&mdash;no topics of conversation excited so much interest
as those which had formed the charm of their residence abroad,&mdash;and
the fair daughters of England drew comparisons unfavourable to fox-hunting
squires and insipid young nobles, when they thought of the
accomplished and fascinating foreigners from whom, in the first dawn
of life, when all their impressions were new and vivid, they had received
such flattering homage.</p>

<p>The mother of Louisa, still young, had not been insensible to prepossessions;
and had a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaison</i> at Rome, where she was unaccompanied
by her husband, the effects of which she had not altogether eradicated.</p>

<p>It is said that the road to the daughter's affections is through the
heart of the mother. Certainly in Italy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cavalier-serventeism</i> generally
has this termination; and, though it is not yet openly established
in England, there are very many women in high life who have some
secret adorer, some favourite friend, to keep alive the flame which too
often lies smothered in the ashes of matrimony. I do not mean that
this attachment is frequently carried to criminal lengths; nor am I
ready to give much credence to the vain boastings of those foreigners
who, when they return to their own country, amuse their idle hours,
and idler friends, with a detailed account of their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnes fortunes</i> in
London.</p>

<p>I shall not prostitute my narrative, had I the data for so doing, by
tracing step by step the well-organised scheme by which Mascalbruni
contrived to ingratiate himself with both the mother and the
daughter. He was young, handsome, and accomplished; an inimitable
dancer, a perfect musician. His dress, his stud, and cabriolet were in
the best taste, and he passed for a man of large fortune.</p>

<p>It may be asked how he supported this establishment? By play.
Play, in men whose means are ample, if considered a vice, is thought
a very venial one. He got admission into several clubs,&mdash;Crockford's
among the rest:&mdash;his games were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écarté</i> and whist; games at which
he was without a match. Cool, cautious, and calculating, he lost with
perfect nonchalance, and won with the greatest seeming indifference.</p>

<p>There was a French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vicomte</i>, with whom he seemed to have no particular
acquaintance, but who was in reality his ally and confederate,
and who had accompanied him to England expressly that they might
play into each other's hands. He belonged to one of the oldest families,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and had one of those historical names that are a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passe par-tout</i>.
I had seen him at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i> of Paris, and he was in the habit at the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écarté</i> table, if he had come without money, which was not unfrequently
the case, of claiming, when the division took place at the end
of the game, two napoleons; pretending that at its commencement he
had bet one on the winner. I need say no more.</p>

<p>He had signalised himself in several rencontres. I have him before
me now, as he used to appear in the Tuileries' gardens, with his narrow
hat, his thin face, and spare figure,&mdash;so spare, that sideways one
might as well have fired at the edge of a knife. To this man Mascalbruni
frequently pretended to have lost large sums, and it is now
well known that they divided the profits of their gains during the season.
No one certainly suspected either of unfair practices, though
their uniform success might have opened the eyes of the blindest.
The Marchioness of S.'s card-parties and those of Lady E. were a
rich harvest, as well as the private routs and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i> to which they
obtained easy admission. Lady M. was well aware that Mascalbruni
had a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i> for play; but it seemed to occupy so little of his
thoughts or intrench on his time, that it gave her no serious alarm.</p>

<p>I have not yet told you, however, as I ought to have done, that
he was a favoured suitor.</p>

<p>The bishop, who, by nature of his office, was seldom in town, was a
cypher in the family, and little thought of interfering with his lady in
the choice of a son-in-law.</p>

<p>But the season now drew to a close, and Mascalbruni received an
invitation to pass the summer at the episcopal palace in the Emerald
Isle. He had succeeded in gaining the affections, the irrevocable
affections of Louisa. Yes,&mdash;she loved him,</p>

<p class="linequot">"Loved him with all the intenseness of first love!"
</p>

<p>Time seemed to her to crawl with tortoise steps when he was absent,&mdash;but
how seldom was that the case! They sang together those
duets of Rossini that are steeped in passion. How well did his deep
and mellow voice marry itself with her contralto! They rode together,
not often in the parks, but through those shady and almost unfrequented
lanes of which there are so many in the environs of the
metropolis; they waltzed together; they danced the mazourka together,&mdash;that
dance which is almost exclusively confined to foreigners,
from the difficulty of its steps, and the grace required in its mazes.</p>

<p>They passed hours together alone,&mdash;they read together those
scenes of Metastasio, so musical in words, so easily retained in the
memory. But why do I dwell on these details? When I look on this
picture and on that, I am almost forced to renounce the opinion that
kindred spirits can alone love; for what sympathy of soul could exist
between beings so dissimilar, so little made for each other? Poor
Louisa!</p>

<p>Mascalbruni accompanied them to Ireland. That summer was a
continual fête. It was settled that the wedding was to take place on
their return to town the ensuing season.</p>

<p>In the mean time the intended marriage had been long announced
in the Morning Post, and was declared in due form to the son at
Naples. Louisa, who was her brother's constant correspondent, in
the openness of her heart did not conceal from him that passion, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
longer, indeed, a secret. Her letters teemed with effusions of her
admiration for the talents, the accomplishments, and the virtues, for
such they seemed, of her intended&mdash;her <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">promesso sposo</i>, and the proud
delight that a very few months would seal their union.</p>

<p>William, who had now had some experience of the Italians, and
who had looked forward to his sister's marrying one of his college
friends, an Irishman with large estates in their immediate neighbourhood,
could not help expressing his disappointment, though it was
urged with delicacy, at this foreign connexion. He wrote also to the
bishop, and, after obtaining from him all the necessary particulars as
to the Marchese Mascalbruni,&mdash;through what channel he became acquainted
with them, by what letter got introduced to Lady &mdash;&mdash;, lost
no time in proceeding to Rome, though the mountains were then infested
by brigands, and the Pontine marshes, for it was the month of
September, breathed malaria.</p>

<p>Our consul was then at Cività Vecchia, but willingly consented to
accompany Mr. M. to Rome, in order to aid in the investigation. He
was intimate with Cardinal &mdash;&mdash;, and they immediately proceeded to
his palace. They found from him that he had never heard the name
of Mascalbruni; that there was no <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">marchese</i> in the pontifical states so
called; and he unhesitatingly declared the letter to be a forgery, and
its writer an impostor.</p>

<p>They then applied to the police, who, after some days' inquiry,
discovered that a person answering the description given had quitted
Rome a few years before, and had been a clerk in the office of a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">notario</i>.</p>

<p>No farther evidence was necessary to convict Mascalbruni of being
a swindler; and, not trusting to a letter's safe arrival, Mr. M. travelled
night and day till he reached the palace at &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine the scene that ensued,&mdash;the indignation
of the father, the vexation and self-reproaches of the mother, or the
heart-rending emotions of the unfortunate girl.</p>

<p>Mascalbruni at first, with great effrontery, endeavoured to brave
the storm; contended that Louisa was bound to him by the most
sacred ties, the most solemn engagements; that his she should be,&mdash;or,
if not his, that she should never be another's; denounced them as
her murderers; and ended with threats of vengeance,&mdash;vengeance
that, alas! he too well accomplished.</p>

<p>It is not very well known what now became of Mascalbruni; but
there is reason to believe that he lay <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">perdu</i> somewhere in the
neighbourhood, watching like a vulture over the prey from which he
had been driven, the corpse of what was once Louisa.</p>

<p>A suspicious-looking person was frequently seen at night-fall prowling
about the environs of the palace; and Miss M.'s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de chambre</i>,
with whom he is said to have carried on an intrigue, was observed by
the servants in animated conversation with a stranger in the garb of
a peasant among the shrubberies and pleasure grounds.</p>

<p>It was through her medium that Mascalbruni gained intelligence
of all that was passing in the palace.</p>

<p>The shock which Louisa had sustained was so sudden, so severe,
that, acting on a frame naturally delicate, it brought on a brain fever.
Her ravings were so dreadful, and so extraordinary; and so revolting
was the language in which she at times clothed them, that even her
mother&mdash;and no other was allowed to attend her&mdash;could scarcely stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
by her couch. How perfect a knowledge of human nature has Shakspeare
displayed in depicting the madness of the shamelessly-wronged
and innocent Ophelia!&mdash;The fragments of those songs to which her
broken accents gave utterance, especially that which ends with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Who, in a maid, yet out a maid,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Did ne'er return again,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>may suggest an idea of the wanderings of the poor sufferer's heated
imagination.</p>

<p>For some weeks her life hung on a thread; but the affectionate
cares and sympathy of a mother, and a sense of the unworthiness of
the object of her regard, at last brought back the dawn of reason;
and her recovery, though slow, was sufficiently sure to banish all
anxiety.</p>

<p>The afflictions as well as the affections of woman are, if I may
judge by my own experience, less profoundly acute than those of our
own sex. Whether this be owing to constitution or education, or
that the superior delicacy and fineness of the nervous system makes
them more easily susceptible of new impressions to efface the old, I
leave it to the physiologist or the psychologist to explain. The river
that is the most ruffled at the surface is seldom the deepest. Thus
with Miss M. Her passion, like</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In the course of three months the image of Mascalbruni, if not effaced
from her mind, scarcely awakened a regret; and, save that at
times a paleness overspread her cheek, rapidly chased by a blush, be
it of virgin innocence or shame, no one could ever have discovered in
her person or bearing any traces of the past.</p>

<p>At this time a paragraph appeared in the Court Journal of the day,
nearly in these words:</p>

<p>"Strange rumours are afloat in the Sister Island respecting a certain
Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">marchese</i>, who figured at the clubs and about town during
the last season. Revelations of an extraordinary nature, that hastened
the return of the Honourable Mr. M. from the Continent, have led
to a rupture of the marriage of the belle of the season, which we are
authorised to say is definitively broken off."</p>

<p>It was a telegraph that the field was open for new candidates; but
no one on this side the water answered it. Louisa M. was no longer
the same,&mdash;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préstige</i> was fled,&mdash;the bloom of the peach was gone.</p>

<p>Scarcely had four months elapsed, however, when fresh preparations
were made for her marriage, and a day fixed for the nuptials.</p>

<p>The hour came; and behold, in the conventional language used on
such occasions, the happy pair, Lady M. the bride-maids, and a
numerous party of friends assembled in the chapel of the palace.
The bishop officiated.</p>

<p>The ceremony had already commenced, and the rite was on the
point of being ratified by that mystical type of union&mdash;the ring&mdash;when
a figure burst through the crowd collected about the doors; a figure
more like a spectre than a man.</p>

<p>So great a change had taken place in him, from the wild and
savage life that he had been leading among the mountains, the privations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
he had endured, and the neglect of his person, that no one
would have recognised him for the observed of all observers, the
once elegant and handsome Mascalbruni. His hair, matted like the
mane of a wild beast, streamed over his face and bare neck. His
cheek was fallen, his eyes sunken in their sockets; yet in them burned,
as in two dark caves, a fierce and sombre fire. His lips were tremulous
and convulsed with passion; his whole appearance, in short, exhibited
the same diabolical rage and thirst of vengeance that had
electrified the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle d'armes</i> in his memorable conflict. He advanced
straight to the altar with long and hurried steps, and, tearing
aside the hands of the couple, the ring fell over the communion rails
to the ground. So profound was the silence, so great the consternation
and surprise the sight of this apparition created in the minds
of all, that the sound of the ring, as it struck and rolled along the
vaulted pavement, was audibly heard. It was an omen of evil augury,&mdash;a
warning voice as from the grave, to tell of the death of premised
joys&mdash;of hopes destroyed&mdash;of happiness for ever crushed. He
stood wildly waving his arms for a moment between the pair, looking
as though they had been transformed into stone, more like two statues
kneeling at a tomb than at the altar. Then he folded his arms;
gazed with a triumphant and ghastly smile at the bride; said, or
rather muttered, "Mine she is!" then, turning to the bridegroom,
with a sneer of scorn and mockery he howled, "Mine she has been;
now wed her!"</p>

<p>With these laconic words he turned on his heel, and regained
without interruption the portal by which he had entered. So suddenly
had all this passed, so paralysed and panic-stricken were the
spectators and audience of this scene, that they could scarcely believe
it to be other than a dream, till they saw the bride extended
without sense or motion on the steps. Thus was she borne, the service
being unconcluded, to her chamber. The ceremony was privately
completed the ensuing day.</p>

<p>No domestic felicity attended this ill-fated union. It was poisoned
by doubts and suspicions, and embittered by the memory of
Mascalbruni's words. "Mine she has been" continually rang in the
husband's ears; and on the anniversary of that eventful day, after a
lingering illness of many months, a martyr to disappointment and
chagrin, she sunk into an untimely grave.</p>

<p>The next we hear of Mascalbruni was his being at Cheltenham.
There he frequented the rooms under very different auspices, and
had to compete with another order of players than those he had been
in the habit of duping. He was narrowly watched, and detected in
the act of pocketing a queen from an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écarté</i> pack. The consequence
was his expulsion from the club with ignominy. His name was placarded,
and his fame, or rather infamy, noised with a winged speed
all over the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>It was no longer a place for him. In the course of the ensuing
week the following announcement was made in a well-known and
widely-circulated weekly paper. It was headed&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"<em>An Italian black sheep.</em>
</p>

<p class="blockquot">"We hope in a short time to present our readers with the exploits
of a new Count Fathom, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi disant</i> marchese, better known than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
trusted, the two first syllables of whose name more than rhyme with
<em>rascal</em>. And as it is our duty to un-<em>mask all</em> such, we shall confine
ourselves at present to saying that he has been weighed at a fashionable
watering-place in Gloucestershire, and found wanting, or
rather practising certain sleights of hand for which the charlatans of
his own country are notorious. He had better sing small here!"</p>

<p>Mascalbruni took the vulgar hint. His funds were nearly exhausted,
and with but a few louis in his pocket he embarked at
Dover, and once more repaired to Paris.</p>

<p>His prospects were widely different from those with which he had
left it. To play the game I have described at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge et noir</i>, requires
a capital. Every respectable house was closed against him. He
now disguised his appearance, so that his former acquaintance should
not be able to recognise him, and frequented the lowest hells&mdash;those
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cloacæ</i>, the resort of all the <em>vilains</em> and <em>chenapans</em>, the lowest dregs
of the metropolis. By what practices this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvais sujet</i> contrived
to support life here for some years is best known to the police,
where his name stands chronicled pretty legibly; it is probable that
he passed much of that time in one of the prisons, or on the roads.</p>

<p>Eighteen months had now elapsed, and the Honourable Mr. M.
with his bride, to whom he had been a short time married, took an
apartment in the Rue d'Artois. A man in a cloak&mdash;an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embocado</i>,&mdash;which
means one who enwraps his face in his mantle so that only
his eyes are visible,&mdash;was observed from the windows often passing
and repassing the hotel. The novelty of the costume attracted the
attention of Mrs. M.; and the blackness of his eyes, and their peculiarly
gloomy expression, made her take him for a Spaniard. She
more than once pointed him out to her husband, and said one day,
"Look, William, there stands that man again. He answers your description
of a bandit, and makes me shudder to look at him."</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, dear," replied Mr. M. smilingly; "we are not
at Terracina. It will be time enough to be frightened then."</p>

<p>The recollection of Mascalbruni had been almost effaced from his
mind; but, had he met him face to face, it is not unlikely that he
<em>would</em> have remembered the villain who had destroyed the hopes of
his family, and marred their happiness for ever.</p>

<p>For some time he never went out at night unaccompanied by his
wife, and always in a carriage. But a day came when he happened
to dine without her in the Rue St. Honoré. The weather being
fine, and the party a late one, he sent away his cabriolet, and after
midnight proceeded to walk home. Paris was at that time very
badly lighted; the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reverberées</i> at a vast distance apart, suspended between
the houses, giving a very dim and feeble ray. Few persons&mdash;there
being then no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trottoirs</i>&mdash;were walking at that hour; and it so
happened that not a soul was stirring the whole length of the street.
But, within a few yards of his own door, the figure I have described
rushed from under the shadow of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte cochère</i>, and plunged a
dagger in his heart. He fell without a groan, and lay there till the
patrol passed, when he was conveyed, cold and lifeless, to the arms
of his bride, who was anxiously awaiting his return. Her agony I
shall not make the attempt to depict: there are some sorrows that
defy description.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the boasted excellence of the Parisian police, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
author of this crime, who I need not say was Mascalbruni, remained
undiscovered.</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, I am enabled to connect two more links
in the chain of this ruffian's history, and thus, as it were, to become
his biographer. Having been in town at the period when he was in
the zenith of his glory, and being slightly acquainted with the family
whom, like a pestilence, it was his lot to destroy and blight, I was
well acquainted with his person, and he with mine; indeed, once
seen, it was not easy to mistake his.</p>

<p>After two winters at Naples, I travelled, by the way of Ravenna
and Rimini, to Venice. The carnival was drawing to a close, and, on
quitting a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i> at Madame Benzon's, I repaired to the Ridotta.
The place was crowded to excess with that mercurial population, who
during this saturnalia, particularly its last nights, mingle in one orgie,
and seem to endeavour, by a kind of intoxication of the senses, and
general licentiousness, to drown the memory of the destitution and
wretchedness to which the iron despotism of the Austrian has reduced
them. The scene had a sort of magnetic attraction in it.</p>

<p>I had neither mask nor domino, but it is considered rather <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distingué</i>
for men to appear without them; and, as I had no love-affair to
carry on, it was no bad means of obtaining one, had I been so inclined.</p>

<p>Among the other groups, I observed two persons who went intriguing
round the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle</i>, appearing to know the secrets of many of
their acquaintances, whom it seemed their delight to torment and
persecute, and whom, notwithstanding their masks, they had detected
by the voice, which, however attempted to be disguised, betrays more
than the eyes, or even the mouth, though it is the great seat of expression.
The pair wore fancy dresses. The domino of the man
was of Persian or Turkish manufacture, a rich silk with a purple
ground, in which were inwoven palm-leaves of gold, The costume
of the lady, who seemed of a portly figure, not the most symmetrical,
was a rich Venetian brocade, such as we see in the gorgeous pictures
of Paul Veronese, and much in use during the dogal times of the republic.
As they passed me, I heard the lady say, looking at me,
"That is a foreigner." "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Si signora, è Inglese</i>," was the reply; "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lo
conosco</i>." Who this could be who knew me,&mdash;me, almost a stranger
at Venice, I was curious to discover. By the slow and drawling
accent peculiar to the Romans, I felt satisfied he was one, and fancied
that I had heard that voice before,&mdash;that it was not altogether
unfamiliar to me.</p>

<p>I was desirous of unravelling the secret, for such it was, as the
man did not address me; and I remained at the Ridotta much later
than I should otherwise have done, in order to find out my unknown
acquaintance. I therefore kept my eye on the couple, hoping that
accident might favour my wish.</p>

<p>On the last nights of the carnival it is common to sup at the Ridotta,
and I at length watched the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognito</i> into a box with his
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">inamorata</i>, where he took off his mask, and whom should I discover
under it but the identical hero of romance, the villain Mascalbruni.</p>

<p>He was an acquaintance who might well shun <em>my</em> recognition, and
I was not anxious he should see I had attracted <em>his</em> observation. As
I was returning to my hotel on the Grand Canal, I asked the gondolier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
if he knew one Signor Mascalbruni. These boatmen are a kind
of Figaros, and, like the agents of the Austrian police, are acquainted
with the names and address of almost every resident in Venice, especially
of those who frequent the public places. The man, however, did
not know <em>my friend</em> by that name,&mdash;perhaps he had changed it. But
when I described his costume, he said that the signor was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cavalier
servente</i> of a Russian princess, who had taken for a year one of
the largest palaces in Venice. "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il signor</i>," he added, "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">canta come
un angelo</i>."</p>

<p>The idea of coupling an angel and Mascalbruni together amused
me. "An angel of darkness!" I was near replying; but thought it
best to be silent.</p>

<p>I had no wish to encounter Mascalbruni a second time. I went
the next day to Fusina, and thence to Milan; indeed I had made all
the preparations for my departure, nothing being more dull than the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carême</i> at Venice.</p>

<p>Two years after this adventure, I was travelling in the Grisons,
after having made a tour of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits cantons</i>, with my knapsack on
my back, and a map of Switzerland in my pocket, to serve the place
of a guide,&mdash;a description of persons to whom I have almost as great
an objection as to cicerones, preferring rather to miss seeing what I
should like to see, than to be told what I ought to like to see; not
that it has fallen to the lot of many guides, or travellers either, to be
present at a spectacle such as I am going to describe. I had been
pacing nine good leagues; and that I saw it was merely accidental,
for if <em>it</em> had not come in my way, <em>I</em> should not have gone out of
mine to witness it.</p>

<p>Coire, the capital of the Grisons, my place of destination for the
night, had just appeared, when I observed a great crowd collecting
together immediately in front, but at some distance off, the peasants
running in all directions from the neighbouring hills, like so many
radii to meet in a centre.</p>

<p>One of these crossed me; and, on inquiring of him the occasion of
all this haste and bustle, I learned that an execution was about to take
place. My informant added with some pride that the criminal was
not a Swiss, but an Italian. He seemed perfectly acquainted with
all the particulars of the event that had transpired, for he had been
present at the trial; and, as we walked along the road together, in
his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</i>,&mdash;bad German, and worse French, with here and there a
sprinkling of Italian,&mdash;he related to me in his own way what I will
endeavour to translate.</p>

<p>"An Englishman of about twenty years of age was travelling, as
you may be, on foot, about seven weeks ago, in this canton, having
lately crossed the St. Gothard from Bellinzona. He was accompanied
by a courier, whom he had picked up at Milan. They halted
for some days in our town, waiting for the young gentleman's remittances
from Genoa, where his letters of credit were addressed. On
their arrival at Coire they had a guide; but the Italian persuaded
his master, who seemed much attached to him, to discharge Pierre,
on the pretence that he was thoroughly acquainted with the country,
and spoke the language, which indeed he did. He was a dark
brigand-looking fellow, with a particularly bad expression of countenance,
and a gloomy look about his eyes; and, for my part, I am surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
that the young man should have ventured to trust himself in
his company, for I should not like to meet his fellow on the road
by myself even in the day-time. Well: the Englishman's money, a
good round sum,&mdash;they say, two hundred napoleons d'or,&mdash;was paid
him by an order on our bankers; and then they set out, but not as
before.</p>

<p>"They had only been two days in company, when the villainous
Italian, who either did not know the road over the mountains, or
had purposely gone out of the way, thought it a good opportunity of
perpetrating an act, no doubt long planned, which was neither more
nor less than despatching his master. It was a solitary place, and a
fit one for a deed of blood. A narrow path had been worn in the
side of a precipice, which yawned to the depth of several hundred
feet over a torrent that rushed, as though impatient of being confined,
foaming and boiling through a narrow chasm opened for itself
through the rocks. I could show you the spot, for I know it well,
having a right of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commune</i> on the mountains; and have often driven
my cows, after the melting of the snows, up the pass, to feed on the
herbage that, mixed with heath and rhododendrons, forms a thick
carpet under foot. It is a pasture that makes excellent cheese.</p>

<p>"But, solitary as the place looks, the Italian did not know that
there are several <em>chalets</em>, mine among the rest, in the Alp; and
herdsmen. As for me, I happened to be down in the plain, or I
might have been an eye-witness of much of what I am about to describe.
I was saying that the spot seemed to suit his purpose; and
his impatience to ease his master of his gold was such, that, happily
for the ends of justice, he could not wait till night-fall, or none but
(and here he pointed to the sky) He above might have been privy to
the crime. It was, however, mid-day. Into the deep-worn pass I
have mentioned runs a rivulet, which, sparkling on the green bank,
had made for itself a little basin. The day was hot and sultry; and
the young gentleman, tempted, it would seem, by the gentle murmur
of the water as it fell rippling over the turf, and its crystal brightness,
stooped down to drink. The Italian watched this opportunity, sprung
upon him like a tiger, and plunged a dagger, which he always carried
concealed about him, into the Englishman's back. Fortunately, however,
the point hit upon the belt in which he carried his money, perhaps on
the napoleons; for, before the assassin could give him a second blow,
he sprang up and screamed for help, calling 'Murder, murder!'</p>

<p>"Three of the herdsmen whom I have mentioned heard the cries,
and came running towards the direction whence they proceeded,
when they discovered two men struggling with each other; but, before
they could reach them, one had fallen, and the other was in the act of
rifling him, in order afterwards to hurl him down the precipice into
the bed of the river. So intent was he on the former of these occupations,
that he did not perceive my countrymen till they seized him.
He made much resistance; but his dagger was not within his reach.
They bound his hands, and, together with the lifeless corpse of his
master, transported him to Coire, where, not to enter into the trial,
he was condemned to death.</p>

<p>"But he has been now some weeks in prison, in consequence of our
not being able to procure a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourreau</i>; and we have been forced to
send for one to Bellinzona, no Grison being willing to perform the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
office. He arrived last night; and how do you think, sir? According
to our laws, he is to be executed with a sword that has not been used
for forty years,&mdash;no murder having been committed in the canton
during all that period,&mdash;though no sword could be applied to better
purpose than it will in a few moments."</p>

<p>Whilst he was thus speaking, we reached the dense circle already
formed. On seeing a stranger approach, they made room for me; and
curiosity to witness this mode of execution, the remnant of barbarous
times, as well as to see the Italian, induced me to enter the Place de
Grève.</p>

<p>At the first glance I recognised Mascalbruni. He was stripped of
his shirt, and on his knees; by his side was a Jesuit to whom he had
just made his confession; and over him, on an elevation from the
ground by means of a large stone, stood the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prevôt</i>, with a sword of
prodigious length and antique shape, and covered with the rust of
ages, pendent in his hands.</p>

<p>The lower part of Mascalbruni's face was fallen, whilst all above
the mouth was drawn upward as from some powerful convulsion.
The eyes, that used to bear the semblance of living coals, had in them
a concentrated and sullen gloom. The cold and damp of the cell, and
the scantiness of his diet, which consisted of bread and water, had
worn his cheek to the bone, and given it the sallowness of one in the
black stage of cholera. His face was covered with a thick beard,
every hair of which stood distinct from its fellows; and his matted
locks, thickly sprinkled with grey, trailed over his ghastly features
and neck in wild disorder. His shoulders down to the waist were,
as I said, bare; and they and his arms displayed anatomically a muscular
strength that might have served as a model for a gladiator.
Over all was thrown an air of utter prostration moral and physical,&mdash;the
desolation of despair.</p>

<p>A few yards to the right, the priest, with his eyes uplifted to heaven,
seemed absorbed in prayer; and between them the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourreau</i>,
who might have superseded Tristan in his office, and been a dangerous
rival in the good graces of Louis the Eleventh. He called to mind
a figure of Rubens',&mdash;not the one who is turning round in the Descent
of the Cross at Antwerp, and saying to the thief, writhing in horrible
contortions after he has wrenched his lacerated foot from the nail,
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacre, chien</i>,"&mdash;but a soldier in another of his pictures in the Gallery
at Brussels (the representation of some martyrdom,) who has just torn
off the ear of the saint with a pair of red-hot pincers, and is eyeing
it with a savage complacency.</p>

<p>It was, in short, exactly such a group, with its pyramidical form
and startling contrasts of colour and expression, as the great Flemish
painter could have desired.</p>

<p>A dead silence, which the natural horror, the novelty of the scene
created, prevailed among the assembled crowd; and it spoke well for
the morality and good feeling of the simple peasantry, that not a woman
was present on the occasion.</p>

<p>The hand of the swordsman was raised, and the stroke fell on
the neck of the culprit; but, horrible to say,&mdash;what was it then to
witness?&mdash;though given with no common vigour, so blunt was the
instrument, that, instead of severing the head, it only inflicted a gash
which divided the tendons of the neck, and the undecapitated body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
fell doubled up, whilst only a few <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouts</i> of blood issued from the
wound.</p>

<p>The tortured wretch's groans and exclamations found an echo in
all bosoms; and it was not till after two more sabre strokes that the
head lay apart, and rolled upwards in the dust. I then saw what I
have heard described of Charlotte Cordé, after she had been guillotined;&mdash;the
muscles of the face were convulsed as if with sensibility,
and the eyes glared with horrid meaning, as though the soul yet lingered
there. Even the executioner could scarcely meet their scowl
without shuddering.</p>

<p>It was the first and last spectacle of this kind at which I mean ever
to be present; and I should not have awaited its awful termination,
could I have penetrated through the living wall that was a barrier to
my exit.</p>

<p>You may now guess from whom I obtained many of the details
contained in this memoir of Mascalbruni. It was from the confessor,
who had endeavoured, but in vain, to give him spiritual consolation in
the dungeon and at the block. The Jesuit and myself had mutual
revelations to make to each other, connecting the present with the
past, and which have enabled me to weave the dark tissue of his
life's thread into one piece. I repeat the last words of the good old
man at our final interview,&mdash;"May God have mercy on his soul!"</p>

A DISAPPOINTED MAN.</h2>

<p class="center f75">WITH AN ILLUSTRATION BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.</p>


<p>Are you a sympathetic reader? If not, I pray you to pass over
the few pages which constitute this article, and indulge your risible
propensity with the happier effusions of the laughing philosophers of
this Miscellany. I have no cachinnatory ambition, and would have
my leaves well watered, not with the sunny drops of joy, but with the
camomilical outpourings of sorrow.</p>

<p>Concluding that my request is granted, I will now proceed, sympathetic
reader, to narrate a few passages of my "strange, eventful
history."</p>

<p>I am a disappointed man,&mdash;nay, I was even a disappointed baby;
for it was calculated that the parental anticipations of my forebears
would have been realised on the 1st of May 1792, whereas, by some
contradictory vagary of Dame Nature, I entered this valley of tears
on the 1st of April! This ought to have been considered prognosticatory
of my future disappointments, and the law of Sparta should
have been rigidly enforced; for what are crooked limbs to a crooked
destiny?</p>

<p>It was the intention of my father (whose name was Jacob Wise)
to have had me christened after my maternal uncle, Theodosius
Otter, Esq.; but, having selected a stuttering godfather, I was unfortunately
baptized as "The-odd-dose-us Oth-er Wise." Nor was this
the only disappointment which attended me on this occasion, for the
pew-opener having received instructions to clean the copper coal-scuttle
in the vestry-room, the basin which contained the vitriol necessary
for that purpose was by some means or other placed in the
font; and to this day I have more the appearance of a tattooed
Indian than a Christian Englishman.</p>

<p>My babyhood was composed of a series of disappointments. My
hair was to have been, in the words of the monthly nurse, "the most
beautifulest horburn," but sprouted forth a splendid specimen of that
vegetable dye called carroty. I was to have been "as straight as an
arrow;" but a cup of tea having been spilled over me as I lay in the
servant's lap before the kitchen fire, I became so dreadfully warped
that I am now a sort of demi-parenthesis, or, as a malicious punster
once called me, "a perfect bow."</p>

<p>I had the measles very mildly, as it was affirmed, for the whole
virulence of the disorder displayed itself in one enormous pustule on
the tip of my nose. This luminary so excited my infant wonder, that
my eyes (really fine for green) were continually riveted to the <em>spot</em>,
and have never forgotten it, for one or other of them is invariably
engaged in searching for the lost treasure.</p>

<p>I was not in convulsions above a dozen times during teething;
but no sooner had I completed my chaplet of pearls, than the striking-weight
of a Dutch clock which overhung my cradle dropped into
my mouth, and convinced me of the extreme simplicity of dental
surgery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 483px;">

<div class="caption">A Disappointed Man</div>
</div>

<p>My "going alone" was the source of an infinitude of anxieties to
my excellent mamma, who was so magnificently proportioned that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
was many months before I could make the circuit of her full-flounced
printed calico wrapper without resting. Poor mamma! she lost her
life from a singular mistake. The house in which we lived had taken
fire, and two good-natured neighbours threw Mrs. Wise out of the
window instead of a feather-bed. She alighted on the head of Captain
S&mdash;&mdash;, who was then considered the <em>softest</em> man in the three kingdoms,
and received little injury by the ejectment; but her feelings
were so lacerated by the mistake, that she refused all food, and lived
entirely by suction, till she died <em>from</em> it.</p>

<p>I will pass over my school-days, merely observing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i> that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi2">"Each day some unlucky disaster</div>
<div class="verse">Placed me in the vocative case with my master,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>a squabby, tyrannical, double-jointed pedagogue. He was nicknamed
<em>Cane-and-Able</em>, and I can testify to the justness of the nomenclature.
At college the same <em>mis</em>-fortune attended me. There was ever an
under-current of disappointment, which rendered all my exertions
nugatory. If I was by accident "full of the god," I could never
knock down any one but a proctor. If I determined on keeping close
in my rooms, the wind immediately changed to N.E. by N. at which
point my chimneys smoked like a community of Ya-Mynheers. My
maternal uncle, Theodosius Otter, Esq. had signified that my expectations
from him must be regulated entirely by my academical distinctions,
and I was "pluck'd for my little-go." This occurred three
months before the old booby's death. My legacy consisted of a presentation
to the Gooseborough free school.</p>

<p>The time at length arrived for me to fall in love. I experienced
the first symptom of this epidemic at a bombazine ball in the city of
Norwich. Selina Smithers was the name of my fair enslaver: she
was about nineteen, fair as Russia tallow, tall, and somewhat slender.
Indeed her condition is perhaps better described by "the slightest
possible approximation to lanky." During one short quadrille she told
me of all her tastes, hopes, experience, family connexions, (including
a brother at sea,) expectations probable and possible, and of two thousand
seven hundred and forty-five pounds, fourteen shillings, and sixpence,
standing in her own name in the three and a half per cents.</p>

<p>With the last <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chassez</i> I was a victim. At the close of the ball I
handed Selina and her mamma into a green fly, and found the next
morning that I had a violent cold in my head, and a violent heat in
my heart.</p>

<p>As I flourished the brass knocker of Mrs. Smithers' door on the
following day, the clock of St. Andrew's church struck two; and
chimed a quarter past, as a girl strongly resembling a kidney-potato,
red and dirty, gave me ingress into a room with green blinds, seven
horsehair-bottomed chairs, a round mahogany table, four oil-paintings
(subjects and masters unknown), two fire-screens of yellow calico
fluted, and a very shabby square piano. On the music-rest was the
song, "We met,&mdash;'twas in a crowd." Singular coincidence,&mdash;<em>we</em> met
in a crowd!</p>

<p>The door opened, and Selina bounded into the room like a young
fawn. Our eyes met, and then simultaneously sought the carpet.
I know not what object her pale blue orbs encountered; but mine fell
on the half-picked head of a red herring! "Can it be possible,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
thought I, "that Selina&mdash;Pshaw! her brother has returned from sea;"
and to his account I placed the body of the vulgar fish. I took her
hand, and gracefully led her to a chair, and then seated myself beside
her. Our conversation grew animated,&mdash;confiding. She recapitulated
the amount of her three and a half per cents, and in the most
considerate manner inquired into <em>my</em> pecuniary situation. I was then
possessed of seven thousand pounds; for my father, during the three
last years of his life, had been twice burned out, and once sold up,
and was thus enabled to leave me independent. She could not conceal
her delight at my prosperous situation,&mdash;generous creature! Possessing
affluence herself, she rejoiced at the well-doing of others.
Day after day passed in this delightful manner, until I ventured to
solicit her to become my wife. Judge of my ecstasy when, bending
her swan-like neck until her fair cheek rested on the velvet collar of
my mulberry surtout, she whispered almost inaudibly,</p>

<p>"How can you ask me such a question?"</p>

<p>"How can I ask you such a question? Because&mdash;because it is
necessary to my happiness. Oh! name the happy hour when Hymen's
chain&mdash;that chain which has but one link&mdash;shall bind you to
me for ever!"</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and then faltered out,</p>

<p>"To-morrow week."</p>

<p>I fell upon my knees. Selina did the same; for, in my joy at her
compliance, I had forgotten that one chair was supporting us both.</p>

<p>Oh, what a busy day was that which followed! I entered Skelton's
(the tailor's) shop with the journeymen. I ordered three complete
suits!</p>

<p>As the rolls were taken into Quillit's parlour, I was shown into the
office. The worthy lawyer thrice scalded his throat in his anxiety to
comply with my repeated requests to "see him immediately." He
came at last. A few brief sentences explained the nature of my business,
and he hastened to accompany me to Selina. I was so excited
by the novelty of my situation, that I fell over the maid who was
cleaning the step of the door, and narrowly escaped dragging Quillit
after. Had he fallen, I shudder at the contemplation of the probable
result; for he was a man well to do in the world, and enjoyed a rotundity
of figure unrivalled in the good city of Norwich. His black
waistcoat might have served for a bill of fare to an eating-house, for
it exhibited samples of all Mrs. Glass's choicest preparations.</p>

<p>Away we went, realising the poet's description of Ajax and Camilla:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,</div>
<div class="verse">The line too labours, and the words move slow:</div>
<div class="verse">Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain,</div>
<div class="verse">Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We resembled Reason and Hope, or one of Pickford's barges and a
towing-horse.</p>

<p>The little brass knocker was again in my hand, the kidney-potato
was again at the door, and I led in the perspiring lawyer, but looked
in vain for that expression of admiration which I fondly anticipated
would have illumined his little grey eyes at the sight of my Venusian
Selina.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Quillit," said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed?" replied Selina.</p>

<p>"We have come, mum," said Quillit, "to arrange a very necessary
preliminary to the delicate ceremony which my friend Wise has informed
me will take place on this day week."</p>

<p>Selina blushed. Her mother (bless me! I've quite overlooked her!)
screwed up her face into an expression between laughing and crying;
and I&mdash;I pushed one hand through my hair, and the other into my
breeches pocket.</p>

<p>"Mum," continued Quillit, "our business this morning is to make
the arrangements for your marriage-settlement; and my friend Wise
wishes to know what part of your two thousand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seven hundred and forty-five pounds, fourteen shillings, and sixpence,"
said I <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>"&mdash;You wish settled upon yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing,&mdash;I require nothing!" exclaimed Selina.</p>

<p>"Hur&mdash;!" said I, half rising from my chair in ecstasy at her disinterestedness.</p>

<p>"Hem!" coughed Quillit, and took out his toothpick.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" I at length ejaculated. "No, Selina; you shall not be
subject to the accidents of fortune. Mr. Quillit, put down two thousand
pounds." And so he did.</p>

<p>The day before my intended nuptials I had paid my customary
visit to Selina, and it was arranged that the <em>settlement</em> should be executed
(what a happy union of terms!) that night. I had left but a
few minutes when I missed my handkerchief. I returned for it. The
kidney-potato shot out of the house as I turned the corner of the
street. I found the door ajar, and, not considering any ceremony necessary,
I walked into the parlour. I had put my handkerchief into
the left pocket of my coat when I was somewhat startled by a burst
of very boisterous male and female merriment. I paused. A child's
treble was then heard, and in a moment after <em>a child</em>&mdash;<em>a live child</em> entered
the room crying most piteously. It ceased on beholding me;
and when its astonishment had subsided, it sobbed out,</p>

<p>"I want mamma!"</p>

<p>"Mamma?" said I. "And who's mamma?"</p>

<p>My query was answered from the first floor.</p>

<p>"Come to mamma, dear!" shouted&mdash;Selina!</p>

<p>I don't know what the sensations of a humming-top in full spin may
be, but I should imagine they are very similar to those which I experienced
at this particular moment. When I recovered, I was stretched
on the hearth-rug with my head in the coal-scuttle, surrounded by
my Selina, her mother, the maid, and I suppose her "brother at sea."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, love?" said &mdash;&mdash; You know whom I mean,&mdash;I
can't write her name again.</p>

<p>"Nothing, madam," I replied, "nothing; only I anticipated being
married to-morrow,&mdash;but I shall be disappointed."</p>

<p>The ensuing week I received notice of action for a breach of promise
of marriage; the ensuing term the cause was tried before an
intelligent jury; and the ensuing day Quillit handed me a bill for
seven hundred and sixty-two pounds, one shilling, and eightpence,
being the amount of damages and costs in Smithers <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</i> Wise. I
paid Quillit, sold my house and furniture at Norwich, and took up my
abode at Bumbleby, in Lancashire, resolving to be as love-proof as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Miss Martineau, which resolution I have religiously observed to this
day.</p>

<p>I was, however, involved in one other tender affair, by proxy,
which produced me more serious annoyances than even my own.</p>

<p>I became acquainted with a merry good-looking fellow, of the name
of Thomas Styles, who had come from somewhere, and was related to
somebody, but no one recollected the who or the where. In the same
town lived an old gentleman, who rejoiced in the singular name of
Smith. He was blessed with one daughter and a wife. The latter
did not reside with him, having taken up her permanent residence in
a small octagonal stone building in the dissenters' burial ground.
Styles, by one of those accidents common in novels, but very occasional
in real life, had become acquainted with Miss Smith. They
had gone through those comparative states of feeling,&mdash;acquaintance,
friendship, love; and, when I was introduced to him, he was just in
want of a good fellow to help him into matrimony. I was just the boy;
my expensive experience, my good-nature, my leisure,&mdash;in short,
there was nothing wanting to fit me for this confidential character.
Now, be it known that old Smith had very strong parliamentary predilections,
and one of his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ nons</i> was, that his son-in-law should
be M.P. for somewhere,&mdash;Puddle-dock would do,&mdash;but an M.P. he
must be. Politics were of no consequence; but he must have a decided
opinion that the Bumbleby railway would be most beneficial, if
carried through a swampy piece of ground which Smith had recently
purchased. Styles was of the same opinion; but then he was only a
member of the "Bull's-eye Bowmen," and Mr. Snuffmore's sixpenny
whist club. I had made myself particularly uncomfortable one afternoon,
in Styles' summer-house, with three glasses of brandy and water
and four mild havannas, when old Smith rushed in to announce the
gratifying intelligence that Mr. Topple, the member for our place, had
fallen into the crater of Mount Vesuvius, and that nothing had been
heard from him since, but a solitary interjection, in consequence of
which there was a vacancy in the representation. The writ had been
issued, and so had an address from Mr. Wiseman, a gentleman possessing
every virtue under the sun, save and except a due sense of
the advantages of Smith's swamp to the railway. This was conclusive.
Smith made a speech, which, being for interest and not for fame, was
short and emphatic.</p>

<p>"Tom, you must contest this election, or never darken my doors
again."</p>

<p>"My dear, sir," said Tom, "nothing would give me greater pleasure;
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll do all that. I'll form a committee <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">instanter</i>," replied Smith;
"leave all to me. Capital hand at an address&mdash;pith, nothing but pith.
Ever see my letter in support of the erection of a pound for stray
cattle?&mdash;pithy and conclusive:&mdash;'Inhabitants of Bumbleby, twenty
shillings make a pound.' The motion was carried."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Tom. "It will appear so presumptuous on
my part, unless a deputation waited on me."</p>

<p>"Certainly,&mdash;better, by all means,&mdash;I'll form one directly," said
Smith.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, issue a placard to prevent the electors making
promises, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will," said Smith. And so he did; for in an hour afterwards
there was not a dead wall in Bumbleby but was papered from one end
to the other.</p>

<p>"Other Wise," said Styles, as Smith waddled up the garden, "this
won't do for me. I couldn't make a speech of ten consecutive lines,
if the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall were depending upon it."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" replied I, rolling my head about in that peculiar style
which an over-indulgence in bibicals will induce.</p>

<p>"It's a fact," replied Tom. "Now, my dear fellow, you can serve
me and your country at the same time. Smith would be equally gratified
at your return for Bumbleby; your opinions are the same as my
own; and your abilities require no panegyric from me."</p>

<p>Whether it was the suddenness of the probable glory, or the effect
of the tobacco and brandy and water, I sat speechless. Silence
gives consent, says an old adage, and so did the town of Bumbleby
the next morning, for every quarter cried out "Other Wise for ever!"
It was too late to retract; and accordingly I was nominated, seconded,
and unanimously elected by a show of hands. A poll was demanded;
and, after a short contest of two days, it was announced in very large
letters, and still larger figures,</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Poll">
<tr><td class="tdl">Wiseman,</td><td class="tdl in4">786</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Other Wise,</td><td class="tdl in4">&nbsp;92</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">Majority,</td><td class="tdl in4">---694</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>I was satisfied, and so was my party. During the preparation for
this unfortunate contest I had allowed Styles to draw <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i> upon
my banker. His friendship knew no bounds; his liberality was as
boundless; and so chagrined was he at the defeat I had experienced,
that he left the next morning without an adieu. I must confess that
I was rather disappointed at his sudden retreat, and considerably more
so on finding that his exertions in my behalf had reduced my income
from four hundred pounds to forty pounds per annum. For the first
time I doubted his friendship. Subsequent inquiries convinced me
he was a scoundrel, and I commenced an immediate pursuit of him,
and an action at law.</p>

<p>Some three months afterwards, I was sauntering about the streets
in the neighbourhood of St. James's Square, when I encountered
Styles. His surprise was as great as mine, but not so enduring; for,
advancing towards me with all the coolness of the 1st of December,
he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Other Wise, how are you? I dare say you thought my sudden
departure odd; I did myself; but I couldn't help it. I'm sorry to
hear how much your contest has distressed you. I was the cause.
Give me your check for fifty pounds, and here's a bill for five hundred,
due to-morrow."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, he handed me an acceptance for
that amount inclosed in a dirty piece of paper. All this was so rapidly
said and done, that before I was aware of it I had given him a
draft on Drummond, shaken hands with him, and was mechanically
discussing a mutton-chop and a bottle of sherry, which I had unconsciously
ordered in the delirium which succeeded Styles' unheard-of
generosity.</p>

<p>I went the next day to Messrs. Podge and Co. in Lombard-street,
with my promise-to-pay&mdash;Eldorado in my pocket. I entered the counting-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
presented my bill, and fully expected to have received
either bank-notes or gold in exchange. I waited a few minutes, and
was then ushered into a back-room, and politely requested to account
for this money promissory document.</p>

<p>"From whom did you receive this bill?" said a gentleman with a
powdered head and an immense watch-chain.</p>

<p>"From Mr. Styles."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly; but I hope there is nothing irregular."</p>

<p>"You can step in, Banks," said the powdered head; and a stout
well-fed man, in a blue coat, with the City arms on the button, <em>did</em>
step in, and very unceremoniously proceeded to inspect the contents
of my various pockets. "Conclusive!" said the powdered head, as he
minutely examined a small piece of crumpled paper which had occupied
one of the pockets of my small-clothes.</p>

<p>I was handed into a hackney-coach, and then into the Mansion-house,
where I was informed that I was to live rent-free for the next
week in his Majesty's jail of Newgate. The bill was a forgery!</p>

<p>The day of trial approached. I walked into the dock with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens
conscia recti</i> depicted on my countenance. I knew I was innocent of
any felonious intention or knowledge; and was certainly very much
<em>disappointed</em> at being found guilty upon the silent evidence of the little
piece of crumpled paper, which was covered with pen and ink experiments
on the signature of John Allgold and Co. whose name occupied
the centre of Styles' bill. The recorder (in a very impressive
manner, I must allow, for his white handkerchief was waving about
the whole time) passed sentence of death upon me, and I was ordered
to be taken from thence, and on the Monday following to be hung by
the neck till I was dead. A pleasant termination, truly!</p>

<p>I was led, stupified by the result of my trial, back to the prison.
When I regained the use of my faculties, my awful situation became
horridly apparent. There was I, an innocent and injured man, condemned
to suffer the extreme penalty of the law. For endeavouring
to gain possession of my own, I was about to become a spectacle for
the fish-fags and costermongers of London,&mdash;to have my name handed
down to posterity by that undying trumpeter of evil-doers, Mr. Catnach,
of the Seven-dials, who alternately delights the public with
"three yards long of every new song, and all for a penny," and "the
last dying speech and confession" of those who, dreading to be bed-ridden,
and possessing an unconquerable aversion to doctors' stuff and
virtue, have danced upon nothing, and died with their shoes on.
"How often," thought I, "have I seen a withered hag kneeling at the
rails of an area, exciting the sympathies and curiosity of servants of
all-work, and greasy melting cooks, by the recital of atrocities that
the hand of man never executed. 'Here's a full, true, and 'tickler
account of a horrid murder, which was performed in the New-cut,
Lambeth, on the body of a baked-'tater manufacturer, who was savagely
and inhumanly murdered by that ferocious and hard-hearted
villain, Benjamin Burker;&mdash;here you have the account how, arter putting
a poor man's plaister, composed of pitch and bird-lime, over the
unhappy <em>indivigual's mouf</em> until the breath was out on his body, he
shoved him into the oven, and lived seven days and nights on baked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
taters and the manyfacterers.' Thus might I be misrepresented. The
thought was madness!"</p>

<p>The morning at length arrived for my execution; but, oh! the horrors
of the night that preceded it! Young, and in the full enjoyment
of life, the morrow was to bring me death! In a little week, the
hand which I then gazed on, would be a banquet for the red worm of
the grave. Even the mother who watched the cradle of my infancy
would have turned loathingly away from the corrupted mass; the earth
which covered me would be thought unhallowed, and my name would
become symbolical with crime. But even this, was nothing to the
contemplation of the scene I had still to enact. To be led forth "the
observed of all observers," who would look on me with an eye, not of
pity, but of morbid curiosity,&mdash;to hang quivering in the air,&mdash;and to
feel, while consciousness remained, that each shuddering of struggling
nature was imparting a savage delight to those who could be the willing
witnesses of the sacrifice of a fellow-creature! My brain sickened
with its agony, and I fell into a stupor which my jailor called sleep.
I was pinioned, and led forth to die. Life had now no charm for me,&mdash;I
was beyond the reach of hope, and death was a desired blessing.
The hangman's hands were about my neck,&mdash;the blood curdled in my
veins as I felt the deadly embrace of the cord. I longed for the signal
of departure; but I was again disappointed. I was reprieved,&mdash;for
I awoke, and found that the bill and all its frightful consequences
were but the result of having eaten a hearty supper of pork-chops
very much underdone! So I was once again a disappointed man,
though, on this occasion, I must own, most agreeably so.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>I have often remarked that, among other ornaments and curiosities,
Hackney contains more ladies' schools than are to be found in almost
any other village, or indeed city, in Europe. In every green rustic lane,
to every tall old-fashioned house there is an iron gate, an ensign of blue
and gold, and a large brass plate, proclaiming that a ladies' seminary
is established upon the premises. On one of these plates is written&mdash;(or
rather was,&mdash;for the pathetic occurrence which I have to
relate took place many years ago)&mdash;on one of these plates, I say, was
engraven the following inscription:</p>

<p class="center">BULGARIA HOUSE.<br />
Seminary for Young Ladies from three to twenty.<br />
<span class="smcap f90">BY THE MISSES PIDGE.</span>
</p>

<p class="author">(Please wipe your shoes.)</p>

<p>The Misses Pidge took a limited number of young ladies, (as limited,
in fact, or as large as the public chose,) and instructed them in
those branches of elegant and useful learning which make the British
female so superior to all other shes. The younger ones learned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
principles of back-stitch, cross-stitch, bob-stitch, Doctor Watts's
hymns, and "In my cottage near a wood." The elder pupils diverged
at once from stitching and samplers: they played like Thalberg, and
pirouetted like Taglioni; they learned geography, geology, mythology,
entomology, modern history, and simple equations (Miss Z. Pidge);
they obtained a complete knowledge of the French, German, and
Italian tongues, not including English, taught by Miss Pidge; Poonah
painting and tambour (Miss E. Pidge); Brice's questions and
elocution (Miss F. Pidge); and, to crown all, dancing and gymnastics
(which had a very flourishing look in the Pidge prospectus, and
were printed in German text,)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dancing</span> and <span class="smcap">Gymnastics</span>, we say,
by Professor <span class="smcap">Dandolo</span>. The names of other professors and assistants
followed in modester type.</p>

<p>Although the signor's name was decidedly foreign, so English was
his appearance, and so entirely did he disguise his accent, that it was
impossible to tell of what place he was a native, if not of London, and
of the very heart of it; for he had caught completely the peculiarities
which distinguish the so-called cockney part of the City, and obliterated
his h's and doubled his v's, as if he had been for all his life in
the neighbourhood of Bow-bells. Signor Dandolo was a stout gentleman
of five feet nine, with amazing expanse of mouth, chest, and
whiskers, which latter were of a red hue.</p>

<p>I cannot tell how this individual first received an introduction to
the academy of the Misses Pidge, and established himself there.
Rumours say that Miss Zela Pidge at a Hackney ball first met him,
and thus the intimacy arose; but, since the circumstances took place
which I am about to relate, that young lady declares that <em>she</em> was not
the person who brought him to Bulgaria House,&mdash;nothing but the infatuation
and entreaties of Mrs. Alderman Grampus could ever have induced
her to receive him. The reader will gather from this, that Dandolo's
after-conduct at Miss Pidge's was not satisfactory,&mdash;nor was it;
and may every mistress of such an establishment remember that confidence
can be sometimes misplaced; that friendship is frequently
but another name for villany.</p>

<p>But to our story. The stalwart and active Dandolo delighted for
some time the young ladies at Miss Pidge's by the agility which he
displayed in the dance, as well as the strength and manliness of his
form, as exhibited in the new amusement which he taught. In a
very short time, Miss Binx, a stout young lady of seventeen, who had
never until his appearance walked half a mile without puffing like an
apoplectic Lord Mayor, could dance the cachouca, swarm up a pole
with the agility of a cat, and hold out a chair for three minutes without
winking. Miss Jacobs could very nearly climb through a ladder
(Jacob's ladder he profanely called it); and Miss Bole ring such
changes upon the dumb-bells as might have been heard at Edmonton,
if the bells could have spoken. But the most promising pupil of
Professor Dandolo, as indeed the fairest young creature in the establishment
of Bulgaria House, was Miss Adeliza Grampus, daughter of
the alderman whose name we have mentioned. The pride of her
mother, the idol of her opulent father, Adeliza Grampus was in her
nineteenth year. Eyes have often been described; but it would require
bluer ink than ours to depict the orbs of Adeliza; the snow
when it first falls in Cheapside is not whiter than her neck,&mdash;when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
has been for some days upon the ground, trampled by dustmen and
jarvies, trodden down by sweeps and gentlemen going to business,
not blacker than her hair. Slim as the Monument on Fish-street-hill,
her form was slender and tall: but it is needless to recapitulate her
charms, and difficult indeed to describe them. Let the reader think
of his first love, and fancy Adeliza. Dandolo, who was employed to
instruct her, saw her, and fancied her too, as many a fellow of his inflammable
temperament would have done in his place.</p>

<p>There are few situations in life which can be so improved by an
enterprising mind as that of a dancing-master,&mdash;I mean in a tender
or amatory point of view. The dancing-master has over the back,
the hands, the feet and shoulders of his pupils an absolute command;
and, being by nature endowed with so much authority, can speedily
spread his sway from the limbs to the rest of the body, and to the
mind inclusive. "<em>Toes a little more out, Miss Adeliza</em>," cries he with
the tenderest air in the world; "back a <em>little</em> more straight," and he
gently seizes her hand, he raises it considerably above the level of
her ear, he places the tips of his left-hand fingers gently upon the
young lady's spine, and in this seducing attitude gazes tenderly into
her eyes! I say that no woman at any age can stand this attitude
and this look, especially when darted from such eyes as those of
Dandolo. On the two first occasions when the adventurer attempted
this audacious man&oelig;uvre, his victim blushed only and trembled; on
the third she dropped her full eyelids and turned ghastly pale. "A
glass of water," cried Adeliza, "or I faint." The dancing-master
hastened eagerly away to procure the desired beverage, and, as he
put it to her lips, whispered thrillingly in her ear, "Thine, thine for
ever, Adeliza!"</p>

<p>Miss Grampus sank back in the arms of Miss Binx, but not before
her raptured lover saw her eyes turning towards the ceiling, and her
clammy lips whispering the name of "Dandolo."</p>

<p>When Madame Schroeder, in the opera of Fidelio, cries, "Nichts,
nichts, mein Florestan," it is as nothing compared to the tenderness
with which Miss Grampus uttered that soft name.</p>

<p>"Dandolo!" would she repeat to her confidante, Miss Binx; "the
name was beautiful and glorious in the olden days; five hundred
years since, a myriad of voices shouted it in Venice, when one who
bore it came forward to wed the sea&mdash;the Doge's bride! the blue
Adriatic! the boundless and eternal main! The frightened Turk
shrunk palsied at the sound; it was louder than the loudest of the
cannon, or the stormy screaming of the tempest! Dandolo! how many
brave hearts beat to hear that name! how many bright swords flashed
forth at that resistless war-cry! Oh, Binx," would Adeliza continue,
fondly pressing the arm of that young lady, "is it not passing strange
that one of that mighty ducal race should have lived to this day, and
lived to love <em>me</em>! But I, too," Adeliza would add archly, "am, as
you know, a daughter of the sea."</p>

<p>The fact was, that the father of Miss Adeliza Grampus was a shellfishmonger,
which induced the young lady to describe herself as a
daughter of Ocean. She received her romantic name from her mother
after reading Miss Swipes's celebrated novel of Toby of Warsaw,
and had been fed from her youth upwards with so much similar literary
ware, that her little mind had gone distracted. Her father had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
sent her from home at fifteen, because she had fallen in love with the
young man who opened natives in the shop, and had vowed to slay
herself with the oyster-knife. At Miss Pidge's her sentiment had
not deserted her; she knew all Miss Landon by heart, had a lock of
Mr. Thomas Moore's hair or wig, and read more novels and poetry
than ever. And thus the red-haired dancing-master became in her
eyes a Venetian nobleman, with whom it was her pride and pleasure
to fall in love.</p>

<p>Being a parlour-boarder at Miss Pidge's seminary, (a privilege
which was acquired by paying five annual guineas extra,) Miss Grampus
was permitted certain liberties which were not accorded to scholars
of the ordinary description. She and Miss Binx occasionally
strolled into the village by themselves; they visited the library unattended;
they went upon little messages for the Misses Pidge; they
walked to church alone, either before or after the long row of young
virgins who streamed out on every Sabbath day from between the
filigree iron railings of Bulgaria House. It is my painful duty to
state that on several of these exclusive walks they were followed, or
met, by the insidious and attentive teacher of gymnastics.</p>

<p>Soon Miss Binx would lag behind, and&mdash;shall I own it?&mdash;would
make up for the lost society of her female friend by the company of a
man, a friend of the professor, mysterious and agreeable as himself.
May the mistresses of all the establishments for young ladies in this
kingdom, or queendom rather, peruse this, and reflect how dangerous
it is for young ladies of any age,&mdash;ay, even for parlour-boarders&mdash;to go
out alone! In the present instance Miss Grampus enjoyed a more
than ordinary liberty, it is true: when the elder Misses Pidge would
remonstrate, Miss Zela would anxiously yield to her request; and
why?&mdash;the reason may be gathered from the following conversation
which passed between the infatuated girl and the wily <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître de danse</i>.</p>

<p>"How, Roderick," would Adeliza say, "how, in the days of our
first acquaintance, did it chance that you always addressed yourself to
that odious Zela Pidge, and never deigned to breathe a syllable to me?"</p>

<p>"My lips didn't speak to you, Addly," (for to such a pitch of familiarity
had they arrived,) "but my heyes did."</p>

<p>Adeliza was not astonished by the peculiarity of his pronunciation,
for, to say truth, it was that commonly adopted in her native home
and circle. "And mine," said she tenderly, "they followed when
yours were not fixed upon them, for <em>then</em> I dared not look upwards.
And though all on account of Miss Pidge you could not hear the accents
of my voice, you might have heard the beatings of my heart!"</p>

<p>"I did, I did," gasped Roderick; "I eard them haudibly. I never
spoke to you then, for I feared to waken that foul friend sispicion. I
wished to henter your seminary, to be continually near you, to make
you love me; therefore I wooed the easy and foolish Miss Pidge,
therefore I took upon me the disguise of&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;of a dancing-master."
(And the young man's countenance assumed a grim and demoniac
smile.) "Yes; I degraded my name and my birthright,&mdash;I
wore these ignoble trappings, and all for the love of thee, my Adeliza!"
Here Signor Dandolo would have knelt down, but the road
was muddy; and, his trousers being of nankeen, his gallant purpose
was frustrated.</p>

<p>But the story must out, for the conversation above narrated has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
betrayed to the intelligent reader a considerable part of it. The fact
is, as we have said, that Miss Zela Pidge, dancing at the Hackney
assembly, was introduced to this man; that he had no profession,&mdash;no
means even of subsistence; that he saw enough of this lady to be
aware that he could make her useful to his purpose; and he who had
been, we believe it in our conscience, no better than a travelling
mountebank or harlequin, appeared at Bulgaria House in the character
of a professor of gymnastics. The governess in the first instance
entertained for him just such a <em>penchant</em> as the pupil afterwards
felt; the latter discovered the weakness of her mistress, and
hence arose Miss Pidge's indulgence, and Miss Grampus's fatal
passion.</p>

<p>"Mysterious being!" continued Adeliza, resuming the conversation
which has been broken by the above explanatory hints, "how did I
learn to love thee? Who art thou?&mdash;what dire fate has brought
thee hither in this lowly guise to win the heart of Adeliza?"</p>

<p>"Hadeliza," cried he, "you say well; <em>I am not what I seem</em>. I
cannot tell thee what I am; a tale of horror, of crime, forbids the
dreadful confession. But dark as I am, and wretched, nay, wicked
and desperate, I love thee, Hadeliza,&mdash;love thee with the rapturous
devotion of purer days: the tenderness of happier times! I am sad
now and fallen, lady; suffice it that I once was happy, ay, respectable."</p>

<p>Adeliza's cheek grew deadly pale, her step faltered, and she would
have fallen to the ground, had she not been restrained by the strong
arm of her lover. "I know not," said she, as she clung timidly to his
neck,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"I know not, I hask not, if guilt's in that art,</div>
<div class="verse">I know that I love thee, whatever thou hart."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"<em>Gilt</em> in my heart," said Dandolo, "gilt in the heart of Roderick?
No, never!" and he drew her towards him, and on her bonnet, her
veil, her gloves, nay, on her very cheeks, he imprinted a thousand
maddening kisses. "But say, my sweet one," continued he, "who
art <em>thou</em>? I know you as yet, only by your lovely baptismal name,
and your other name of Grampus."</p>

<p>Adeliza looked down and blushed. "My parents are lowly," she
said.</p>

<p>"But how then came you at such a seminary?" said he; "twenty
pound a quarter, extras and washing not included."</p>

<p>"They are humble, but wealthy."</p>

<p>"Ha! who is your father?"</p>

<p>"An alderman of yon metropolis."</p>

<p>"An alderman! and what is his profession?"</p>

<p>"I blush to tell; he is&mdash;<em>an oystermonger</em>."</p>

<p>"AN OYSTERMONGER!" screamed Roderick in the largest capitals.
"Ha! ha! ha! this is too much!" and he dropped Adeliza's
hand, and never spoke to her during the rest of her walk. They
moved moodily on for some time, Miss Binx and the other young
man marching astonished in the rear. At length they came within
sight of the seminary. "Here is Bulgaria House," cried the maiden
steadily; "Roderick, we must part!" The effort was too much for
her: she flung herself hysterically into his arms.</p>

<p>But, oh, horror! a scream was heard from Miss Binx, who was
seen scuttling at double-quick time towards the school-house. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
young man had bolted completely; and close at the side of the lovely
though imprudent couple, stood the angry&mdash;and justly angry&mdash;Miss
Zela Pidge!</p>

<p>"Oh, Ferdinand," said she, "is it thus you deceive me? Did I
bring you to Bulgaria House for this?&mdash;did I give you money to buy
clothes for this, that you should go by false names, and make love
to that saucy, slammerkin, sentimental Miss Grampus? Ferdinand,
Ferdinand," cried she, "is this true,&mdash;can I credit my eyes?"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;your eyes!" said the signor angrily as he darted at her a
withering look, and retired down the street. His curses might be
heard long after he had passed. He never appeared more at Bulgaria
House, for he received his dismissal the next day.</p>

<p>That night all the front windows of the Miss Pidges' seminary
were smashed to shivers. <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span></p>

<p>On the following Thursday <em>two</em> places were taken in the coach to
town. On the back seat sate the usher, on the front the wasted and
miserable Adeliza Grampus.<span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span></p>


<h3 class="center f90">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>But the matter did not end here. Miss Grampus's departure elicited
from her a disclosure of several circumstances which, we must
say, in no degree increased the reputation of Miss Zela Pidge. The
discoveries which she made were so awkward, the tale of crime and
licentiousness revealed by her so deeply injurious to the character of
the establishment, that the pupils emigrated from it in scores. Miss
Binx retired to her friends at Wandsworth, Miss Jacobs to her relations
in Houndsditch, and other young ladies not mentioned in this
history to other and more moral schools; so that absolutely, at the
end of a single half year, such had been the scandal of the story, the
Misses Pidge were left with only two pupils,&mdash;Miss Dibble, the articled
young lady, and Miss Bole, the grocer's daughter, who came in
exchange for tea, candles, and other requisites supplied to the establishment
by her father.</p>

<p>"I knew it, I knew it!" cried Zela passionately, as she trod the
echoing and melancholy school-room; "he told me that none ever
prospered who loved him,&mdash;that every flower was blighted upon which
he shone! Ferdinand, Ferdinand! you have caused ruin there"
(pointing to the empty cupboards and forms); "but what is that to
the blacker ruin <em>here</em>!" and the poor creature slapped her heart, and
the big tears rolled down her chin, and so into her tucker.</p>

<p>A very, very few weeks after this, the plate of Bulgaria House was
removed for ever. That mansion is now designated "Moscow Hall,
by Mr. Swishtail and assistants:"&mdash;the bankrupt and fugitive Misses
Pidge have fled, Heaven knows whither! for the steamers to Boulogne
cost more than five shillings in those days.</p>

<p>Alderman Grampus, as may be imagined, did not receive his daughter
with any extraordinary degree of courtesy. "He was as grumpy,"
Mrs. G. remarked, "on the occasion as a sow with the measles."&mdash;But
had he not reason? A lovely daughter who had neglected her
education, forgotten her morals for the second time, and fallen almost
a prey to villains! Miss Grampus for some months was kept in close
confinement, nor ever suffered to stir, except occasionally to Bunhill-row
for air, and to church for devotion. Still, though she knew him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to be false,&mdash;though she knew that under a different, perhaps a prettier
name, he had offered the same vows to another,&mdash;she could not but
think of Roderick.</p>

<p>That <em>Professor</em> (as well&mdash;too well&mdash;he may be called!) knew too
well her father's name and reputation to experience any difficulty in
finding his abode. It was, as every City man knows, in Cheapside;
and thither Dandolo constantly bent his steps: but though he
marched unceasingly about the mansion, he never (mysteriously)
would pass it. He watched Adeliza walking, he followed her to
church; and many and many a time as she jostled out at the gate of
the Artillery-ground, or the beadle-flanked portal of Bow, a tender
hand would meet hers, an active foot would press upon hers, a billet
discreetly delivered was as adroitly seized, to hide in the recesses of
her pocket-handkerchief, or to nestle in the fragrance of her bosom!
Love! Love! how ingenious thou art! thou canst make a ladder of a
silken thread, or a weapon of a straw; thou peerest like sunlight into
a dungeon; thou scalest, like forlorn hope, a castle wall; the keep is
taken!&mdash;the foeman has fled!&mdash;the banner of love floats triumphantly
over the corpses of the slain!<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Thus, though denied the comfort of personal intercourse, Adeliza
and her lover maintained a frequent and tender correspondence.
Nine times at least in a week, she by bribing her maid-servant, managed
to convey letters to the Professor, to which he at rarer intervals,
though with equal warmth, replied.</p>

<p>"Why," said the young lady in the course of this correspondence,
"why, when I cast my eyes upon my Roderick, do I see him so wofully
changed in outward guise? He wears not the dress which formerly
adorned him. Is he poor?&mdash;is he in disguise?&mdash;do debts oppress
him, or traitors track him for his blood? Oh that my arms might
shield him!&mdash;Oh that my purse might aid him! It is the fondest wish
of</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Adeliza G.</span></p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Aware of your fondness for shell-fish, Susan will leave a
barrel of oysters at the Swan with Two Necks, directed to you, as
per desire.</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Ad. G.</span></p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Are you partial to kippered salmon? The girl brings three
pounds of it wrapped in a silken handkerchief. 'Tis marked with
the hair of</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Adeliza</span>.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I break open my note to say that you will find in it a small
pot of anchovy paste: may it prove acceptable. Heigho! I would
that I could accompany it.</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">A.G.</span>"</p>

<p>It may be imagined, from the text of this note, that Adeliza had
profited not a little by the perusal of Mrs. Swipes's novels; and it
also gives a pretty clear notion of the condition of her lover. When
that gentleman was a professor at Bulgaria House, his costume had
strictly accorded with his pretensions. He wore a black German coat
loaded with frogs and silk trimming, a white broad-brimmed beaver,
hessians, and nankeen tights. His costume at present was singularly
changed for the worse: a rough brown frock-coat dangled down to the
calves of his brawny legs, where likewise ended a pair of greasy
shepherd's-plaid trousers; a dubious red waistcoat, a blue or bird's-eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
neckerchief, and bluchers, (or half-boots,) remarkable for thickness
and for mud, completed his attire. But he looked superior to
his fortune; he wore his grey hat very much on one ear; he incessantly
tugged at his smoky shirt-collar, and walked jingling the halfpence
(when he had any) in his pocket. He was, in fact, no better
than an adventurer, and the innocent Adeliza was his prey.</p>

<p>Though the Professor read the first part of this letter with hope
and pleasure, it may be supposed that the three postscripts were still
more welcome to him,&mdash;in fact, he literally did what is often done in
novels, he <em>devoured</em> them; and Adeliza, on receiving a note from him
the next day, after she had eagerly broken the seal, and with panting
bosom and flashing eye glanced over the contents,&mdash;Adeliza, we say,
was not altogether pleased when she read the following:</p>

<p>"Your goodness, dearest, passes belief; but never did poor fellow
need it more than your miserable, faithful Roderick. Yes! I <em>am</em>
poor,&mdash;I <em>am</em> tracked by hell-hounds,&mdash;I <em>am</em> changed in looks, and
dress, and happiness,&mdash;in all but love for thee!</p>

<p>"Hear my tale! I come of a noble Italian family,&mdash;the noblest,
ay, in Venice. We were free once, and rich, and happy; but the
Prussian autograph has planted his banner on our towers,&mdash;the talents
of his haughty heagle have seized our wealth, and consigned
most of our race to dungeons. I am not a prisoner, only an exile.
A mother, a bed-ridden grandmother, and five darling sisters, escaped
with me from Venice, and now share my poverty and my home.
But I have wrestled with misfortune in vain; I have struggled with
want, till want has overcome me. Adeliza, <span class="smcap">I want bread</span>!</p>

<p>"The kippered salmon was very good, the anchovies admirable.
But, oh, my love! how thirsty they make those who have no means
of slaking thirst! My poor grandmother lies delirious in her bed,
and cries in vain for drink. Alas! our water is cut off; I have none
to give her. The oysters was capital. Bless thee, bless thee! angel
of bounty! Have you any more sich, and a few shrimps? My sisters
are <em>very</em> fond of them.</p>

<p>"Half-a-crown would oblige. But thou art too good to me already,
and I blush to ask thee for more. "Adieu, Adeliza,</p>

<p class="author">"the wretched but faithful</p>
<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Roderick Ferdinand</span>,</p>
<p class="author">"(38th Count of Dandolo.)</p>
<p>"Bell-yard, June &mdash;."</p>

<p>A shade of dissatisfaction, we say, clouded Adeliza's fair features
as she perused this note; and yet there was nothing in it which the
tenderest lover might not write. But the shrimps, the half-crown,
the horrid picture of squalid poverty presented by the count, sickened
her young heart; the innate delicacy of the woman revolted at the
thought of all this misery.</p>

<p>But better thoughts succeeded: her breast heaved as she read and
re-read the singular passage concerning the Prussian autograph, who
had planted his standard at Venice. "I knew it!" she cried, "I
knew it!&mdash;he is of noble race! O Roderick, I will perish, but I will
help thee!"</p>

<p>Alas! she was not well enough acquainted with history to perceive
that the Prussian autograph had nothing to do with Venice, and had
forgotten altogether that she herself had coined the story which this
adventurer returned to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>But a difficulty presented itself to Adeliza's mind. Her lover asked
for money,&mdash;where was she to find it? The next day the till of the
shop was empty, and a weeping apprentice dragged before the Lord
Mayor. It is true that no signs of the money were found upon him;
it is true that he protested his innocence; but he was dismissed the
alderman's service, and passed a month at Bridewell, because Adeliza
Grampus had a needy lover!</p>

<p>"Dearest," she wrote, "will three-and-twenty and sevenpence
suffice? 'Tis all I have: take it, and with it the fondest wishes of
your Adeliza.</p>

<p>"A sudden thought! Our apprentice is dismissed. My father
dines abroad; I shall be in the retail establishment all the night,
<em>alone</em>.</p>

<p class="author">"A.G."</p>

<p>No sooner had the Professor received this note than his mind was
made up. "I will see her," he said; "I will enter that accursed shop."
He did, and <em>to his ruin</em>.<span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span></p>

<p>That night Mrs. Grampus and her daughter took possession of the
bar or counter, in the place which Adeliza called the retail establishment,
and which is commonly denominated the shop. Mrs. Grampus
herself operated with the oyster-knife, and served the Milton morsels
to the customers. Age had not diminished her skill, nor had wealth
rendered her too proud to resume at need a profession which she
had followed in early days. Adeliza flew gracefully to and fro with
the rolls, the vinegar bottle with perforated cork, and the little pats
of butter. A little boy ran backwards and forwards to the Blue Lion
over the way, for the pots of porter, or for the brandy and water,
which some gentlemen take after the play.</p>

<p>Midnight arrived. Miss Grampus was looking through the window,
and contrasting the gleaming gas which shone upon the ruby
lobsters, with the calm moon which lightened up the Poultry, and
threw a halo round the Royal Exchange. She was lost in maiden
meditation, when her eye fell upon a pane of glass in her own window:
squeezed against this, flat and white, was the nose of a man!&mdash;that
man was Roderick Dandolo! He seemed to be gazing at the
lobsters more intensely than at Adeliza; he had his hands in his
pockets, and was whistling Jim Crow.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Miss Grampus felt sick with joy; she staggered to the counter,
and almost fainted. The Professor concluded his melody, and entered
at once into the shop. He pretended to have no knowledge of
Miss Grampus, but <em>aborded</em> the two ladies with easy elegance and
irresistible good-humour.</p>

<p>"Good evening, ma'am," said he, bowing profoundly to the <em>elder</em>
lady. "What a precious hot evening, <em>to</em> be sure!&mdash;hot, ma'am, and
hungry, as they say. I could not resist them lobsters, 'specially when
I saw the lady behind 'em."</p>

<p>At this gallant speech Mrs. Grampus blushed, or looked as if she
would blush, and said,</p>

<p>"Law, sir!"</p>

<p>"Law, indeed, ma'am," playfully continued the Professor; "you're
a precious deal better than law,&mdash;you're <em>divinity</em>, ma'am; and this, I
presume, is your sister?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<p>He pointed to Adeliza as he spoke, who, pale and mute, stood
fainting against a heap of ginger-beer bottles. The old lady was
quite won by this stale compliment.</p>

<p>"My daughter, sir," she said. "Addly, lay a cloth for the gentleman.
Do you take hoysters, sir, hor lobsters? Both is very fine."</p>

<p>"Why, ma'am," said he, "to say truth, I have come forty miles
since dinner, and don't care if I have a little of both. I'll begin, if
you please, with that there, (Lord bless its claws, they're as red as
your lips!) and we'll astonish a few of the natives afterwards, <em>by</em> your
leave."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grampus was delighted with the manners and the appetite of
the stranger. She proceeded forthwith to bisect the lobster, while
the Professor in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégagé</i> manner, his cane over his shoulder, and a
cheerful whistle upon his lips, entered the little parlour, and took possession
of a box and a table.</p>

<p>He was no sooner seated than, from a scuffle, a giggle, and a smack,
Mrs. Grampus was induced to suspect that something went wrong in
the oyster-room.</p>

<p>"Hadeliza!" cried she; and that young woman returned blushing
now like a rose, who had been as pale before as a lily.</p>

<p>Mrs. G. herself took in the lobster, bidding her daughter sternly
to stay in the shop. She approached the stranger with an angry
air, and laid the lobster before him.</p>

<p>"For shame, sir!" said she solemnly; but all of a sudden she began
to giggle like her daughter, and her speech ended with an "<em>Have
done now!</em>"</p>

<p>We were not behind the curtain, and cannot of course say what
took place; but it is evident that the Professor was a general lover of
the sex.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grampus returned to the shop, rubbing her lips with her fat
arms, and restored to perfect good-humour. The little errand-boy
was despatched over the way for a bottle of Guinness and a glass
of brandy and water.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hot with!</span>" shouted a manly voice from the eating-room, and
Adeliza was pained to think that in her presence her lover could eat
so well.</p>

<p>He ate indeed as if he had never eaten before: here is the bill as
written by Mrs. Grampus herself.</p>

<p>"Shell-fish in all varieties. N.B. a great saving in taking a quantity."</p>

<p>"A saving in <em>taking a quantity</em>," said the stranger archly. "Why,
ma'am, you ought to let me off <em>very cheap</em>;" and the Professor, the
pot-boy, Adeliza, and her mamma, grinned equally at this pleasantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"However, never mind the pay, missis," continued he; "we an't
agoing to quarrel about <em>that</em>. Hadd another glass of brandy and
water to the bill, and bring it me, when it shall be as I am now."</p>

<p>"Law, sir," simpered Mrs. Grampus, "how's that?"</p>

<p>"<em>Reseated</em>, ma'am, to be sure," replied he as he sank back upon
the table. The old lady went laughing away, pleased with her
merry and facetious customer; the little boy picked up the oyster-shells,
of which a mighty pyramid was formed at the Professor's feet.</p>

<p>"Here, Sammy," cried out shrill Mrs. Grampus from the shop,
"go over to the Blue Lion and get the gentleman his glass: but no,
you are better where you are, pickin' up them shells. Go you, Hadeliza;
it is but across the way."</p>

<p>Adeliza went with a very bad grace; she had hoped to exchange
at least a few words with him her soul adored; and her mother's jealousy
prevented the completion of her wish.</p>

<p>She had scarcely gone, when Mr. Grampus entered from his dinner-party.
But, though fond of pleasure, he was equally faithful to
business: without a word, he hung up his brass-buttoned coat, put on
his hairy cap, and stuck his sleeves through his apron.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Grampus was tying it, (an office which this faithful lady
regularly performed,) he asked her what business had occurred during
his absence.</p>

<p>"Not so bad," said she; "two pound ten to-night, besides one
pound eight to receive;" and she handed Mr. Grampus the bill.</p>

<p>"How many are there on 'em?" said that gentleman smiling, as
his eye gladly glanced over the items of the account.</p>

<p>"Why, that's the best of all: how many do you think?"</p>

<p>"If four did it," said Mr. Grampus, "they wouldn't have done
badly neither."</p>

<p>"What do you think of <em>one</em>?" cried Mrs. G. laughing, "and he an't
done yet. Haddy is gone to fetch him another glass of brandy and
water."</p>

<p>Mr. Grampus looked very much alarmed. "Only one, and you
say he an't paid?"</p>

<p>"No," said the lady.</p>

<p>Mr. Grampus seized the bill, and rushed wildly into the dining-room:
the little boy was picking up the oyster-shells still, there were
so many of them; the Professor was seated on the table, laughing as
if drunk, and picking his teeth with his fork.</p>

<p>Grampus, shaking in every joint, held out the bill: a horrid thought
crossed him; he had seen that face before!</p>

<p>The Professor kicked sneeringly into the air the idle piece of
paper, and swung his legs recklessly to and fro.</p>

<p>"What a flat you are," shouted he in a voice of thunder, "to
think I'm a goin' to pay! Pay! I never pay&mdash;<span class="smcap">I'm Dando</span>!"</p>

<p>The people in the other boxes crowded forward to see the celebrated
stranger; the little boy grinned as he dropped two hundred
and forty-four oyster-shells, and Mr. Grampus rushed madly into his
front shop, shrieking for a watchman.</p>

<p>As he ran, he stumbled over something on the floor,&mdash;a woman and
a glass of brandy and water lay there extended. Like Tarquinia reversed,
Elijah Grampus was trampling over the lifeless body of Adeliza.</p>

<p>Why enlarge upon the miserable theme? The confiding girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
in returning with the grog from the Blue Lion, had arrived at the
shop only in time to hear the fatal name of <span class="smcap">Dando</span>. She saw him,
tipsy and triumphant, bestriding the festal table, and yelling with
horrid laughter! The truth flashed upon her&mdash;she fell!</p>

<p>Lost to worldly cares in contemplating the sorrows of their idolized
child, her parents forgot all else beside. Mrs. G. held the vinegar-cruet
to her nostrils; her husband brought the soda-water fountain
to play upon her; it restored her to life, but not to sense. When
Adeliza Grampus rose from that trance she was a <span class="smcap">MANIAC</span>!</p>

<p>But what became of <em>the deceiver</em>? The gormandizing ruffian, the
lying renegade, the fiend in human shape, escaped in the midst of
this scene of desolation. He walked unconcerned through the shop,
his hat cocked on one side as before, swaggering as before, whistling
as before: far in the moonlight might you see his figure; long, long
in the night-silence rang his demoniac melody of Jim Crow!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Samuel the boy cleaned out the shop in the morning, and
made the inventory of the goods, a silver fork, a plated ditto, a dish,
and a pewter pot were found to be wanting. Ingenuity will not be
long in guessing the name of <em>the thief</em>.</p>

<p>Gentles, my tale is told. If it may have deterred one soul from
vice, my end is fully answered: if it may have taught to school-mistresses
carefulness, to pupils circumspection, to youth the folly of
sickly sentiment, the pain of bitter deception; to manhood the crime,
the <em>meanness</em> of gluttony, the vice which it occasions, and the wicked
passions it fosters; if these, or any of these, have been taught by
the above tale, Goliah Gahagan seeks for no other reward.</p>

<a name="BIDDY_TIBS_WHO_CARED_FOR_NOBODY" id="BIDDY_TIBS_WHO_CARED_FOR_NOBODY"></a>BIDDY TIBS, WHO CARED FOR NOBODY.</h2>


<p>"Marry in thy youth!" This golden truth is writ in one of the
"gates," or articles of the "Sadder." We know not if the eyes of Jacob
Tibs ever opened upon this questionable axiom; or whether the consciousness
of his own weakness was the load-star which lighted him,
"poor darkened traveller," to the <em>blessed state</em>. Be it as it might,
Jacob, though no longer in youth, and in spite of my Uncle Toby's
showing that "love is below a man,"&mdash;Jacob took unto himself a wife,&mdash;an
unquestionable <em>better half</em>, seeing his share was so small in the
economy of domestic life. But at how high a standard Jacob <em>ought</em> to
have placed his happiness,&mdash;and marriage is with some supposed to
be a good,&mdash;he held it a plague, a sickness long in killing! Jacob,
as we have before stated, married, and from that seed his crops of
evil sprung! <em>The apple of his eye</em>, like that of the East, was ashes
to his taste. Alas! that Jacob ever married!</p>

<p>Biddy Tibs, "<em>who cared for nobody</em>," was, at the time we write, a
small withered piece of stale old age. In her husband's days,&mdash;and
they a bountiful Providence, or rather rope, had shortened; not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
he was hanged, for Jacob was a modest-minded man!&mdash;she made up
in temper what she lacked in size; which temper, in the opinion of
many, was the personal property of the devil! And as the most difficult
conquest of Mahomet was that of his wife, so it proved with
Jacob, who vainly hoped that, "as with time and patience the leaf
of the mulberry-tree becomes satin," so might his wife's temper from
sour turn to sweet! How little did Jacob appreciate the constancy
of woman!</p>

<p>Jacob Tibs was part owner of a Liverpool West India trader, and
of which he was nominally the captain. But Mrs. T., in this as in all
other instances, was the great "captain's captain:" her lungs&mdash;and
never had a speaking-trumpet such lungs&mdash;were hurricane-proof!
and the title of "boatswain" was not improperly a sobriquet of this
fair cheapener of sugar, with which the vessel was ostensibly freighted,
though upon occasions she had more slaves than her husband on
board; so that, what with natural and human produce, Jacob climbed
a golden ladder. Tired with a "life of storms," he changed his vessel
for a house, the sea for a quiet town, and might have rested his
old age in peace; but, alas for Jacob! he was married!</p>

<p>Argus is reported to have slept,&mdash;can we wonder that Mrs. Tibs's
two eyes for once lost their vigilance, and left her husband the master
of himself, and one day&mdash;for that she passed a short distance off;
and Jacob resolved that this drop of comfort should prove a well;
and in truth it <em>did</em>, as will be shown. Old Jacob had friends, as who
has not that has anything to give?&mdash;and this day&mdash;the only one he
could look forward to with a smile since he had been "blessed"&mdash;he
determined should prove a golden one; and, spite of the servant-girl's
warnings of "How missus would wop him!" Jacob held a levee,&mdash;some
dozen sons of Eve, whose mouths sucked brandy like a
sponge,&mdash;good old souls of a good old age, whose modest wants 'bacca
and brandy could supply.</p>

<p>Jacob held his levee! but as he boasted no privy purse, no stocking
with a foot of guineas, and no brandy but a bottle two-thirds full,
left by strange accident in the cupboard, what was to be done? For
the first time in his life Jacob was surprised into an act of rebellion;
and with a death-doing hammer in one hand, and a screwdriver in
the other, did Jacob invade the&mdash;to him&mdash;sanctity of the cellar. The
lock was wrenched, lights were stuck in empty bottles, and Jacob,
who in his young-going days had swilled it with the best, soon verified
the sentiment of Le Sage, that "a reformed drunkard should
never be left in a cellar." Now, whether joy or brandy had to answer
for the sin, we know not; but, certain it is, Jacob got drunk, and
measured his length&mdash;he was a tall man&mdash;upon the ground.
Friends should be our brothers in affliction; <em>his</em> were true ones, and
at happy intervals of time they sank beside him, completely overcome,&mdash;showing
how little was their pride, how great their fellowship!</p>

<p>How long they might have continued in this undeniable state of
bliss would be an useless guess, for the last of Jacob's friends&mdash;and
he was no sudden faller-off&mdash;had scarcely deposited himself upon the
ground in happy indifference for his clothes, when the cracked-bell
voice of Mrs. Tibs, who had unexpectedly returned, roused the maid
into a consciousness that missus had come home! Domestic contentions
are at no time an interesting theme; and as most of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
readers&mdash;we allude to the married portion&mdash;have doubtless experienced
them in real life, romance would fall far short of the truth;
the single we advise to marry, and experience will teach them what
we here pass over. When Jacob's better half beheld her bottles
empty, her casks upturned, and her husband, for the first time since
he had enjoyed that felicity, deaf to the music of her voice, a bucket
of water from the well refreshed Jacob to a truth he would willingly
have slept in ignorance of,&mdash;that the wife of his bosom was alive,
and he started as a thief would at an opening door. She seized
him by the collar, and, showering the first-fruits of her passion
upon him who could so well appreciate it, the "boatswain" rose
within her, and, after bestowing sundry terms of approbation upon
his boon companions, she turned them out of the house, as the vulgar
saying hath it, "with their tails between their legs." Jacob
would have slunk away, but Fortune willed it otherwise. His
"rib" shouted the word of command, "Tack, you lubber, and be
---- to you!" Jacob recognised the voice,&mdash;how could he have
mistaken it?&mdash;and waited for orders. Now it so fell out, as Mrs.
Tibs ran for the bucket of water, her cap, in the press of business,
caught by a twig, dropped into the well, and eighteen-pence had been
that day expended in decoration. With the assistance of Nanny the
maid, Jacob was to be wound down in the bucket; and, spite of his
appeals to the contrary, with one foot in the tub, and both hands on
the rope, he was lowered, and half soused in water, until he reached
the ribbon treasure of his wife's head. The cap clutched in one
hand, he was raised dripping by the windlass. Each twist brought
him nearer to the top, when, sorrowful to relate, the rope gave way,
and Jacob dropped like lead into the well; a hollow splash was heard
in the water, and Mrs Tibs stood by in speechless agony. At length
her grief found vent, and, pitching her voice to its shrillest note,
she cried, "Oh, my cap!"</p>

<p>Alas for Jacob! his head struck with swingeing force against the
bricks, where to this day the impression may be seen: he fell stunned
into the water, and before aid could be obtained, which Mrs. Tibs did
in less than two hours and a half, Jacob was dead!</p>

<p>Now, though Jacob was dead, he was not buried. A good wife is
a jewel to her husband: what must she be to his mortal remains?
Biddy's affection was too great to allow any but herself to be his undertaker,
and she contracted with a jobbing carpenter for a wooden
shell. Jacob never loved luxuries, and the pride of cloth covered
not his outside, gilt nails syllabled not his virtues. Four ploughmen
were hired at a shilling a-head&mdash;half-a-crown they had the uncharity
to ask&mdash;to be his bearers, and Jacob was lowered to what he had
been for years a stranger to&mdash;a house of peace!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the city of C&mdash;&mdash;, famous for its antiquities, its cathedral, and
its hop-grounds, is a terrace, commanding an extensive view of a
cattle-market and the road beyond; along which road, one sunny afternoon,
a gentleman, or, for fear of mistakes, we will simply call him an
officer, rode on a piebald horse. Passing along, a certain window on
the terrace attracted his attention, and the officer on the piebald
horse kissed his hand to its fair occupant. Now, it so happened that
Miss Lauretta Birdseye was seated at the very next window, in the
very next house to that on which the officer had bestowed his attentions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and no sooner was the kiss blown, than slam went the window!
A glazier who was passing felt himself a richer man by at least
three and sixpence. No sooner was the window closed, than&mdash;curtains
are always in the way&mdash;they were drawn aside, and a face
was glued to the glass, all eyes and wire ringlets. Another kiss from
the officer on the piebald horse. The lady nodded her head, and was
thinking of blushing; but as blushes, like hedge-side roses, are vulgar,
and glass so thick, her prudence whispered her not to be wasteful.
As the rider passed, the window was once more opened, and her
head thrust out, to see what to her was indeed a sight,&mdash;a man, as she
thought, looking at her,&mdash;when what should she behold at the next
window but Laura Dyke, "that impudent slut," as she said, "looking
after the men!" Her modesty was scandalized, and once more the
window descended with a crash!</p>

<p>The following morning Miss Lauretta Birdseye knocked a gentle
knock at the dwelling of Mrs. Tibs, her next-door neighbour. The
door was opened by Laura, who filled the double capacity of drudge
and niece to her loving aunt Biddy Tibs. Since the demise of the late
lamented Jacob, she had led a life of widowhood, no man being found
rash enough to venture where Jacob had trod before. Years had passed,
and Biddy Tibs was old and withered, and her skin, like parchment,
hung dry and shrivelled! The fire of her youth was gone, but the embers
still remained: what her tongue had lost in might it had gained
in bitterness; she stabbed a reputation at each word, and mixed her
gall in every household hive! Such was Biddy Tibs; and, though
possessed of no mean wealth, her avarice clung like birdlime to her.
Biddy had a brother, an honest tradesman: his wife died young,
and his children, for he had two, a boy and a girl, were unto him gold
and jewels! Biddy held up her hands, and called it a tempting of
Providence. Long sickness and misfortunes&mdash;for brother Dick had
friends&mdash;and serving others, placed him in a debtors' prison! Without
means, and lacking food, Dick asked his sister's aid,&mdash;a score of
pounds to make him a man again. Biddy with thousands saw him
want on;&mdash;saw him, sick and feeble, die, a prisoner for a friend's
debt, and his children without a roof but heaven! Now, whether
Biddy's conscience smote her,&mdash;and it was speculated by some that
she possessed that luxury,&mdash;we know not; but, a few weeks after, her
servant-girl, for some or for no fault, had been turned out of doors
in the middle of the night; and, as her place must be supplied, pity
came to Biddy's aid, and her niece, an interesting girl of some sixteen
years, was sent for. The boy, Teg, less fortunate, was left to
starve; but he was a shrewd youth, fourteen, and had a squint eye,
a sign of a kind of cunning, and, if a jest may be pardoned, Teg always
looked round the corner. Laura luxuriated in the waggon; Teg, less
fortunate, trudged behind, begging as he went his food. But charity
dwells not on the highway, and Teg's food was mostly unasked; a
turnip diet and a hedge-side bed ended not a youth who was never
born to be choked by indigestion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tibs took in the girl, for she must have a drudge; Teg had
a penny given him, and the door shut in his face. Teg cried first,
then got in a passion, and, like most people in a pet, quarrelled with
his bread and butter; for he flung the penny through one of the parlour
windows, when, as ill luck would have it, it missed the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
his loving aunt, and ended the days of a cracked tea-cup. Alas! that
charity should bring evil upon the giver! for, taking the window and
cup into consideration, Biddy's charity cost her shillings, when she
had only intended to bestow a penny.</p>

<p>Teg spat upon her threshold, and went, no one cared or knew
whither.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Laura was now eighteen, and opened the door to Miss Lauretta
Birdseye, who looked daggers of indignation,&mdash;for Laura was a pretty
girl,&mdash;and asked if Mrs. Tibs were at home. Laura's meek answer
was, "Yes, Miss Birdseye; will you walk in?" Lauretta did, and sat
in the parlour <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with Mrs. Tibs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tibs was to the city of C&mdash;&mdash; what Ariadne's thread was to
Theseus,&mdash;the leading-string in all amours, all stolen meetings, all clandestine
marriages. Numberless were the wives and husbands, maids
and bachelors, who through her means had held communion sweet
with objects of their choice. Messages and letters were her peculiar
province; in fact, Biddy Tibs was a post-office in her own person;
and these praiseworthy efforts she exercised not altogether from mercenary
motives, though, to do her justice, her pride never stood in
the way where money was offered: but she loved mischief as a cat
loves milk, and would cheat for nothing, rather than not cheat at all.
Now, as the officer on the piebald horse had kissed his hand, as Lauretta
thought, to her, she could not rest until she had consulted old
Tibby, for so she was called. <em>There</em> at all events she should know all
about the officer, and there, no doubt, the officer would inquire after
her; and, seated opposite old Tibby, the conversation began.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mrs. Tibs," commenced Lauretta, "I am horrorfied
to think what the girls about here are come to; for <em>my</em> part, you
know, I hate the men!"</p>

<p>"I know you do," chimed in Biddy; "your mother tells everybody
so: but them gals about here have no shame!"</p>

<p>"None!" and Lauretta rose with her subject. "As for those
Greyham's girls, I declare a man can't walk for them; and those Miss
Highwaters, they are no better than they should be, I know. Look
how they dress! and we all know what they have to live upon. And
those Miss Cartriges, with their thick ankles, waddling up and down,
and looking after the men: for <em>my</em> part, I never walk without mother's
with me, for those nasty fellows do look at one so."</p>

<p>Here an indistinct "Hem!" escaped Biddy.</p>

<p>"But I never look at them again, like the girls about here! never!"</p>

<p>Biddy looked at her from under her grey eyes, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Men," continued Miss B. "are such impudent fellows, especially
military men; and, would you think it? an officer on a piebald horse
actually kissed his hand to me yesterday afternoon!"</p>

<p>Old Tibby looked up with a face full of wonder and infidelity.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought it!" ejaculated Lauretta.</p>

<p>Biddy shook her head as she added, "Who, indeed!"</p>

<p>"But I let him know I wasn't one of those sort of people, for I
shut the window in his face, and I saw him kiss his hand again."</p>

<p>"What! after you had shut the window?" and Biddy looked a
note of interrogation in each eye.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I&mdash;I saw him through the curtains."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" was Tibby's echo. "And&mdash;well, I couldn't imagine who it
could be for."</p>

<p>"Who what was for?" inquired Miss B.</p>

<p>"A letter."</p>

<p>"A letter!" and Lauretta's voice fluttered.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tibby; "but, knowing how much <em>you hated</em> the men,
I never thought of you." Saying which, the old woman fumbled in
her pocket, and, taking a three-cornered note from a whole phalanx
of others, read the inscription,&mdash;"To Laura."</p>

<p>"People will call me Laura," said Lauretta, as she seized upon the
note, broke the seal, and read as follows:&mdash;"Sweet Laura,&mdash;When I saw
you at the window, and kissed my hand,"&mdash;twice, Mrs. Tibs,&mdash;"need
I say how I wished your rosy lips were near me; but, before many
hours, I trust I shall whisper in your ear the love I feel for my pretty
little angel." Lauretta held her breath till she was red in the face in
a vain endeavour to look celestial. The letter continued:&mdash;"And if
my sweet Laura will meet me on the 'Mount,' this evening, I will
fly with her from the misery she now suffers, to love and happiness.
Should you not be there, I shall return to the barracks, and put an
immediate end to the existence of your devoted,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">"Augustus Green Horn</span>, Royal Rifle Corps."</p>

<p>Miss Birdseye felt twenty years younger at the intelligence,&mdash;for
a man must be in earnest when he threatens to kill himself,&mdash;and,
with a true tragedy uplifting of the hands, she exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tibs, I wouldn't have a man's death at my door for a world!
No, Augustus&mdash;&mdash;" Further exclamation was cut short by a sort of
titter outside the parlour-door. Now none knew better than Lauretta
Birdseye how well a keyhole afforded sight and sound; and, throwing
the door suddenly open, she burst into the passage. A hurried
footstep on the stair convinced her of what she knew from experience
to be a fact, that by the time the door is opened the listener gets out
of sight.</p>

<p>After sundry comments upon the meanness of listening, Lauretta
informed Mrs. Tibs, who sat like a cat watching a mouse, of her
Christian determination to save human life by sacrificing herself, all
loth as she was, to the officer of the piebald horse!</p>

<p>"It was the first time in her life," as she said, "a man had ever
made an appointment with her,"&mdash;who shall question the truth?&mdash;and
her delicacy yielded to her philanthropy!</p>

<p>Lauretta determined to go,&mdash;and, what is more, without her mother.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The "Mount" alluded to in Augustus Green Horn's letter is a
hill planted round with winding hedges; and the lawn on which it
stands forms the principal promenade of all the little gentry, all the
small-consequence people, their pride stuck like a nosegay in their
button-holes, who look in looks of hot-bed consequence the dignity
the tradesman bows to.</p>

<p>It was a dark evening, and the cathedral clock struck nine as Lauretta
Birdseye passed through the gates of the broad walk. Her horror
may be imagined when she saw servant-maids and others,&mdash;who had
nothing but their character to live upon, stealing in and out the trees
in loving paces with&mdash;Lauretta shut her eyes&mdash;the fellows! 'Prentice
boys were here whispering golden precepts in the ears of willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
maids, who, as servant-maids are not supposed to blush, cried "La!"
Lauretta hurried across the green,&mdash;doubtless to escape such infamy,&mdash;to
the foot of the "Mount;" a man and some "impudent hussy"
were coming down the way she was to go up,&mdash;and, or her eyes deceived
her, no less a hussy than Laura Dyke! who, she shuddered to
think, had picked up a new man. Lauretta heard&mdash;or fancied she
heard&mdash;a titter as they passed; and the man&mdash;he looked very like an
officer&mdash;laughed outright. Lauretta bridled in the full virginity of
three-and-thirty, and walked up the opposite side! How long she
walked up and down, this side and that side, from the top to the
bottom, and sate "like Patience" on one of the seats at the top, we
will not here describe. Suffice it, after waiting two hours and three-quarters,
a boy, who brought the candles, laid hold of her in the dark,
and, spite of her exertions to the contrary,&mdash;Lauretta was strong and
bony,&mdash;ravished a kiss! Whether the boy's taste was not matured,
or what, we know not, but he did not offer to repeat his rashness; and
Lauretta, who held kissing a vice, after telling him "what a rude boy
he was," and "hoping he would not do it again," walked very slowly
down the "Mount," waited ten minutes at the bottom, and then, with
a heavy heart went home to bed, strengthened in the truth that men
have no taste, and women no shame!</p>

<p>To her gentle summons on the next morning, Biddy herself opened
the door. Lauretta looked, and so did Biddy as she cried, "What
you! then where's that devil's niece of mine? the jade's been out
all night, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With some of the fellows, take my word for it. Mrs. Tibs, the
age we live in is a disgrace to our sex&mdash;look at <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>"Well, if I do," half screamed the old woman, "I do more than
the men do. And haven't you been carried off after all? Oh! oh!"
and Biddy wheezed and chuckled like an old grey ape.</p>

<p>"Ma'm!" and Lauretta looked a vestal, "I am not aware, ma'm,
what you mean."</p>

<p>"What! not of the officer on the piebald horse?" Biddy's countenance
changed, and she turned white with passion as she added,
"And that beggar's slut of mine, I'll teach her to cross me!" But, as
her eye rested upon Lauretta, her face changed again, and pursed
into a thousand wrinkles as she chuckled, "How long did you wait?
Oh! oh!" and she gloated on the wincing countenance of her next-door
neighbour.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tibs!" and Lauretta spoke with the conscious dignity of a
Cleopatra; "I have had a strange thought about Laura, and I am
afraid we have made a little mistake."</p>

<p>"Mistake!" and Biddy's eyes opened like an owl's.</p>

<p>"Yes; for, after the officer kissed his hand, I opened the window,
and there I saw that good-for-nothing girl of yours looking after him,
and he <em>might</em> have blown his filthy kisses to her; and last night,&mdash;I
won't be certain,&mdash;but I think I saw her coming down the 'Mount'
with a man, and he looked very like my dear Augus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The countenance of Biddy fell, and her skin became lead as she
gasped, "Bat that I was not to see it; that letter was for her after all!"</p>

<p>"Instead of <em>me</em>!" and Lauretta waxed wrathful as she added,
"She heard us read it through the key-hole. I thought I heard a
titter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us not mistake the passion of Biddy Tibs; it was not the ruin
of her niece grieved her,&mdash;no! she could get another servant from
the workhouse; but she had fattened on the idea that, Lucretia as
Lauretta was, she had at length stumbled on a Tarquin!&mdash;it was
wine and oil to her heart. But, to find herself cozened, to have
hatched the wrong egg!&mdash;her fury knew no bounds. She raved,
and&mdash;we trust, for the first time in her life&mdash;uttered curses, and in
so wild a scream that neighbours came running to her assistance;
when, lashed by her own temper, the amiable Biddy Tibs fell down in
a swoon, having burst a blood-vessel, and was carried to bed.</p>

<p>Miss Birdseye took the opportunity of informing a room-full of attentive
listeners, "that the shameless hussy, Laura Dyke, had gone
off with a man!" and so great was her horror, that, upon the butcher-boy's
bringing the meat, she wouldn't suffer him to come into the passage,
but kept the door ajar, for fear, as she said, "the fellow should
look at her!"</p>

<p>The sick lion was a baby to Biddy Tibs, and, though <em>she</em> "cared for
nobody," everybody cared for her&mdash;last will and testament. Her
wealth had been looked upon by the telescopic eyes of an attentive
few, who brought her&mdash;as "trifles show respect"&mdash;trifles of the least
ambitious nature; and now, when Biddy was ill, and not likely to
last above a day or two, their consideration knew no bounds. One
would bring her&mdash;they were so cooling&mdash;some currants, on a cabbage
leaf; another, a pot of jam; a third, an invitation,&mdash;if she <em>could</em> go, it
would do her so much good. Biddy was not expected to live the
day. But&mdash;oh, the ingratitude of this old creature!&mdash;ill as she was,
her grey eyes looked like glass upon them, and twinkled with a cunning
light; and in the course of the day she promised, in no less
than six different quarters, the house she lived in, and a legacy beside.
How good are they who wait upon the sick! but, though sick,
Biddy, as the saying is, was "hard to die," and the doctor was justly
surprised, who, after giving her over the preceding night, found her
alive the next morning; and, notwithstanding she had three doctors,
in the space of a few weeks, as her friends justly lamented, Biddy had
cheated the devil, and, what was of still more consequence, themselves
of currants and jam.</p>

<p>In due course of time Mrs. Tibs was restored to health; and not
only left the city of C&mdash;&mdash;, but her loving friends, who looked their
last of Biddy Tibs, "who cared for nobody."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now to trace the history of Teg Dyke, who, we before
said, was a shrewd boy, and, like most shrewd children taught by
bad example, he became of the bad the worst. Driven from his aunt's
door, without shelter and without food, Teg turned his steps where
chance directed, and, "with Providence for his guide," before night-fall
was some miles on the London road. Begging or stealing his
way, as accident and his necessity compelled, the poor lad found himself
sore-footed, hungry, hopeless, in the outskirts of London, which
then, even more than now, was a huge nursery for crime,&mdash;a living
chess-board, and circumstance the player! Teg was ragged, and
none would employ him; begging was so unprofitable there was no
living by it. Without food for two whole days Teg grew desperate,
and, tempted by the smell, stole from the door of a cook-shop a
plateful of savoury tit-bits,&mdash;the third lost that morning; and, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
act of tasting, Teg was detected, seized, and, by a merciful magistrate
sent to the House of Correction. Teg, himself no sinner, was
here shut round by sin. Teg stole a meal, urged by the crying
wants of hunger, and he was here mated with those who held theft a
principle; and, like a bur, he clung to vice, since honesty had cast
him down: and, to say truth, Teg found more fellowship in a jail,
more communion, than in the outer world; for here they took delight
in teaching what they knew without a premium. Where else could
Teg have learnt a trade so cheaply? "The cove was quick and willing,"
and, respecting nothing else,&mdash;they must have been rogues,&mdash;respected
genius! Genius lies hid in corners; and Teg who, had his
aunt not thrust him from her door, might have become merely an
honest man, sent to jail for stealing what none would give him,&mdash;food,&mdash;became,
with a little practice, an accomplished thief!</p>

<p>Who shall say Biddy was to blame for shutting her door on so
much depravity? Again, was not her wisdom shown in her behaviour
to her niece? Should she have treated her with the least appearance
of kindness, who, driven like a dog, had the wickedness to
stain her threshold with ingratitude? Had she bestowed a sign of
goodness upon her, she had then deserved it. But, no; she had
treated her niece like a beast of burthen, and how had she returned
her affection? Biddy trembled as she thought of it!</p>

<p>Laura's ingratitude must have risen like a ghost upon her sleepless
eye! What must have been her self-accusation when, deserted by
the Honourable Augustus Green Horn, she found herself not only a
mother, but a beggar, halting in the streets, and with a pale and
stricken countenance suing for bread? Then, indeed, must her
aunt's loving-kindness have come in sweet dreams of the past, and
whispered love and gentleness! But Laura had a callous mind, and,
strange to say, never once felt her deprivation, or she would have
sunk beneath it, as an outcast from society, her freshness gone; her
beauty, like an autumn's leaf, seared, and cast forth unto the winds;
her heart bruised, and her hopes destroyed, she crawled at midnight
through the worst streets of London's worst quarter, the scoff of
many, the despised of all, the debauched victim of any, her child a
cripple from its birth, and in the malignity of a fever dead! And
yet Laura, midst all these evils, wept hot tears; but, what proved
she must have been dead to feeling, she never once thought of the
motherly kindness of Biddy Tibs.<span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span></p>

<p>Some years had passed since Biddy turned her back upon the city
of C&mdash;&mdash;, and left a name blushing with its good deeds behind her.
She now lived in a small town in the neighbourhood of the metropolis,
where her riches formed the subject of many an alehouse gossip.
But, as old age fell upon her, the vice of gold came with it, and she
lived in a crazy wooden house, without the fellowship of a breathing
thing, and for the best of reasons. No cat could live upon her fare,
and hope to be alive at the end of the month,&mdash;no dog was ever
seen to stop at a bone Biddy threw away; her charity never descended
to her garden, nor did the sparrows,&mdash;they knew it would
be a waste of time;&mdash;and thus she lived without kin and without
kind, no servant being so little a feeder as to live upon abuse.
And it was noted as a peculiar fact, that, the older she grew, the
more evil grew her tongue. Characters fell like grass before her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Young or old, weak or strong, all felt her lash! And upon one
occasion she made such inroads upon the chastity of two maiden
ladies, sisters, and worthy to be so of the far-famed Irish giant, that,
under pretence of tea and scandal, Biddy could not resist the temptation;
she was induced to pay them a visit. A stream ran through
these maiden sisters' grounds; and lifting Biddy in their arms,&mdash;a
mere shuttlecock to two such battledores,&mdash;she was gently dropt into
the water, where she enjoyed, what she had been for years a stranger
to, a comfortable wash. So runs the story; and Biddy, vowing vengeance
and the law, which last she obtained, for Biddy was rich,
added so much by her daily tales to their reputations, that in the end
she remained sole mistress of the field,&mdash;the maiden ladies leaving
Biddy and the town behind them.</p>

<p>It was a cold November night, the wind howled, and the rain beat
against the windows as Biddy Tibs sat in her room; the night was
without moon or stars, and the sky looked black as the old woman
peered through the window into the garden, and the fields at the
back of her house; the rain fell in streams, and the wind moaned like
a human voice. For an instant she saw, or thought she saw, a light
shoot across the garden. She looked, and looked, and&mdash;she closed the
shutters, and sat closer to the fire; and, rocking herself over it in her
chair, mumbled, "Blind eyes that I have!&mdash;how should a light get
there? I could see in the dark once like a cat; but now&mdash;" and the
old woman rocked over the fire, with her head bent double to the
grate. A rushlight with a long snuff burnt on the table, and the
room looked shadowy and full of forms.</p>

<p>'Twas midnight; but still Biddy sat within her chair, and rocked,
and rocked, and looking at the fire, as cinder after cinder blackened
in the grate, she muttered, and spoke as to herself, "They're none
of my getting,&mdash;none of my flesh! Didn't I feed, clothe her?&mdash;she
ran away from my roof, and let her want. A night like this will
break her spirit, and teach her what it is to be without one&mdash;'twill&mdash;&mdash;"
She paused suddenly, and bent her ear as in the act of listening; her
grey eyes gazed round the room as she said, "It sounded like a door
creaking, or a bolt;" and again she listened. The candle burnt dimly
on the table, and the embers grew darker and darker as Biddy spread
her hands to catch their warmth, and muttered, "At night, one is
full of fancies; it's only the wind;" and, communing with herself, she
added, "I've paid them back their own, and given them lies for lies, and
they hate me for it: but they fear me, too,&mdash;that's one comfort,&mdash;for
they know I'm rich. Rich&mdash;ha! ha! there's a sly cupboard there,"
and she pointed to a recess in the wall, where a concealed door stood
half ajar; "there's a nest holds more eggs than they think for; and
if I had liked&mdash;but the boy is none of mine&mdash;the boy&mdash;" A draught
of air as from an opened door made her look round. She sat frozen
to her chair as the figure of a man darkened in the room; a second,
masked like his fellow, stood in the shadow of the door; and Biddy,
with a fixed stare, looked like a corpse, blue-lipped and hollow-eyed.
Her chair shook under her, and her voice came not, though her mouth
opened, and her throat worked as if to scream! The man moved a
step; it was electric! Biddy started to her feet, and with a hollow
voice cried "Murder!" The ruffian with a curse darted at her
throat, and, in a hissing whisper between his teeth, cried, "Quiet, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
hag, or I'll settle you!" Biddy, old and feeble as she was, fastened
with both hands upon his, and struggled in his grip. The mask fell
from his face, and with starting eyes she looked at what seemed to
scorch them, uttered a choking scream, and&mdash;Let us draw the curtain.</p>

<p>The next morning speculation was busy that at so late an hour the
shutters of Mrs. Tibs's house remained unopened; she was an early
riser, and now 'twas noon; their knocking obtaining no answer, the
door was forced; and in the back room they found Biddy Tibs upon
the ground, dead, with a handkerchief knotted round her throat.
The small cupboard in the recess was thrown wide open, and her
drawers forced; and it was soon spread over the town that Biddy Tibs
was murdered!</p>

<p>A few weeks had passed, and anxious and expectant thousands
were seen moving in a huge mass on the road to Tyburn. A man
was to be hanged! And, as the people have so little recreation, of
course the roads were thronged with delighted crowds, all hastening
to the "gallows-tree." Women yelled their execrations at the head
of the pale and shaking culprit, for he had murdered one of their own
sex; and clapped and shouted as the cart drew from under his clinging
feet. Men, "as it was only for a woman," "thought hanging too
bad," and merely hooted, groaned, and hissed. Indeed, so popular
was the excitement, that ladies&mdash;<em>real</em> ones, for they paid guineas for
a sight on a waggon,&mdash;waved their handkerchief, and wondered such
wretches were suffered to exist.</p>

<p>As the last struggle of the swinging corpse left him stiff and dead,
a half-clothed and haggard woman asked, in a hoarse and shaking
voice, the name of the murderer.</p>

<p>"What, that 'ere?" was the reply, and a finger pointed to the
stripling figure of the hanging man; "he as murdered his aunt?&mdash;why
Slashing Bill, <em>alias</em> Teg Dyke."</p>

<p>A scream&mdash;a wild and shrieking scream rang through the air, and
Laura dropt senseless.</p>

<p>The bulk of Mrs. Tibs's property came to her niece, but disease
had left her scarce a shadow of herself. Her eyes looked leaden!
Want, sorrow, and dissipation had writ their blight upon her, and, at
the end of six months,&mdash;an apothecary having been frequent in his
visits,&mdash;poor Laura was no more!</p>

<p>How different had been the fate of Biddy Tibs had she lent her
brother Dick the score of pounds! Teg would have been an honest
tradesman like himself, Laura a tradesman's wife, Biddy had lived
for years, and the pillow of her death-bed been smoothed by the
hands of loving friends. But, as it was, her brother died from want;
Biddy fell, strangled by her nephew's hand. He had been seen
in a taproom, where the wealth of the old woman who lived at the
wooden house was talked of; part was traced to him; his companion
confessed; and Teg died a felon's death; Laura, from the effects
of want and dissipation!</p>

<p>Biddy's property was the subject of a law-suit between two of
her distant relations, which, to the best of our knowledge, remains
unsettled to this day!</p>

<p>In a village churchyard in the neighbourhood of London the grass
grows rank about a tombstone which is still pointed at as the grave
of "<em>Biddy Tibs, who cared for nobody!</em>"</p>

<h3>RUN ACROSS CHANNEL.</h3>


<p>Once more upon the dark blue water! It is noon,&mdash;the sun shines
gloriously; the sea, undulated by a slight swell from the Atlantic,
falls gently on the beach, or breaks upon the beetling precipice which
forms the headland of Rathmore. The wind has almost "sighed itself
to rest," and, coming across the sparkling surface of the ocean in
partial eddies, ruffles it for a moment and passes on. Fainter and
fainter still,&mdash;nothing but an occasional cat's-paw is visible, far as the
helmsman's eye can range. The cutter has no longer steerage way;
the folds of the ample mainsail flap heavily as the yacht rolls in the
run of the tide, which, setting rapidly to the eastward, drifts the unmanageable
vessel along a chain of rocky islands, severed by some
tremendous convulsion from the main, to which they had been originally
united.</p>

<p>A more magnificent and a more varied scene than that visible from
the yacht's deck could not be imagined. A-beam lay the grey ruins
of Dunluce, lighted up by a flood of sunshine; the shores of Portrush,
with its scattered bathing-houses, and the highlands of Donegal at
the extreme distance, appeared astern. On the left was an expanse
of ocean, boundless, waveless, beautiful: the sea-gull was idly resting
on the surface, the puffin and the cormorant diving and appearing
continually; while a league off a man-of-war brig, covered to the very
trucks with useless canvass, lay as if she rode at anchor. Beyond
the motionless vessel, the Scottish coast was clearly defined; the
bold outline of the shores of Isla presented itself: and, half lost in
the haze, the cone of Jura showed yet more faintly. On the starboard
bow the Giant's Causeway rose from the water, and with a glass you
could trace its unequal surface of basaltic columns; while right ahead
Bengore and Rathlin completed this mighty panorama.</p>

<p>Nor was the cutter from which this scene was viewed an object void
of interest. She was a vessel of some seventy tons, displaying that
beauty of build and equipment for which modern yachts are so remarkable.
The low black hull was symmetry itself, while the taunt
spars and topmast displayed a cloud of sail, which at a short distance
would appear to require a bark of double the size to carry. Above
deck everything was simple and ship-shape; below, space had been
accurately considered, and not an inch was lost. Nothing could surpass
the conveniency of the cabins, or the elegance with which the
fittings and furniture were designed.</p>

<p>Four hours passed,&mdash;not a breath of wind stirred: a deader calm
I never witnessed. We drifted past the Causeway, and, leaving the
dangerous rock of Carrickbannon between us and the flying bridge of
Carrick-a-rede, found ourselves at five o'clock rolling in the sound of
Rathlin, with Churchbay and Ballycastle on either beam.</p>

<p>There is not in calm or storm a nastier piece of water than that
which divides the island from the main. Its currents are most rapid;
and, from the peculiar inequality of the bottom, in calms there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
heavy and sickening roll, and in storms a cross and dangerous sea.
Without a leading wind, or plenty of it, a vessel finds it difficult to
stem the current; and, in making the attempt with a light breeze, a
man is regularly hung up until a change of tide enables him to slip
through.</p>

<p>Judging from the outline of Rathlin, this island must have been
originally disparted from the main; and the whole bottom of the
sound evinces volcanic action. Nothing can be more broken and
irregular than the under surface. At one cast the lead rests at
ten, and at the next it reaches thirty fathoms. Beneath, all seems
rifted rocks and endless caverns, and easily accounts for the short
and bubbling sea that flows above. Everything considered, the
loss of life occasioned by the passage of this sound is trifling. For
weeks together all communication with the main land is frequently
totally interrupted; and, until the weather moderates, the hardiest
islander will not dare to venture out. But as the sea seldom gives
up its dead, and the furious under-currents sweep them far from the
place where they perished, many a stranger has here met his doom,
and his fate remained a mystery for ever.</p>

<p>Still the calm continued, the tide was nearly done, and we had the
comfortable alternative of anchoring in Churchbay or drifting back
"to the place from whence we came." It would have vexed a saint,
had there been one on board. Calculating on a speedy and certain
passage, we had postponed our departure until the last hour. On
Monday the regatta would commence; and we should have been in
the Clyde the day before. A breeze for half an hour would have
carried us clear of the tides, and liberated us from this infernal sound;
and every man on board had whistled for it in vain. Dinner was
announced, and, wearied with rolling and flapping, we briskly obeyed
the summons. I paused with my foot within the companion: the
master's eye was turned to the brig outside us; mine followed in the
same direction.</p>

<p>"It's coming&mdash;phew!" and he gave a low and lengthened whistle,
as if the tardy breeze required encouragement to bring it on. The
light duck in the brig's royals fluttered for a moment, and then blew
gently out; the top-gallant sails filled; presently the lower canvass
told that the wind had reached it. The vessel has steerage way again;
the breeze steals on, curling over the surface of the water, and in a
few minutes we too shall have it.</p>

<p>On it came: the short and lumbering motion of the yacht ceased;
she heeled gently over, and the table swung steadily as with increasing
velocity the vessel displaced the water, and flung it in sparkling
sheets from her bows. Next minute the master's voice gave comfortable
assurance from the skylight&mdash;"The breeze was true, and
before sunset there would be plenty of it."</p>

<p>Those who prefer the security of the king's highway to breasting
"the pathless deep," build upon the certainty with which their journeyings
shall terminate, and argue that there is safer dependence
in trusting to post-horses than to the agency of "wanton winds." No
doubt there is; the worst delay will arise from a lost shoe or a broken
trace. The traveller has few contingencies to dread; he will reach
the Bear for breakfast, and the Lion for dinner; and, if he be a borrower
from the night, he will be surely at the Swan, his halting-place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
ere the town-clock has ceased striking and the drum has beaten its
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reveille</i>. To me that very regularity is not to be endured; the wheels
grate over the same gravel that the thousand which preceded them
have pressed before; the same hedge, the same paling meets the eye;
there hangs the well-remembered sign; that waiter has been there
these ten years,&mdash;ay, the same laughing barmaid, and obsequious
boots, and bustling hostler, all with a smile of welcome, cold, mechanical,
and insincere; not even the novelty of a new face among
them,&mdash;all rooted to their places like the milestones themselves. Pish!
one wearies of the road; it has no danger, no interest, no excitement.
Give me the deep blue water; its very insecurity has charms for me.
Is it calm?&mdash;mark yon cloud-bank in the south! There is wind
there, for a thousand! It comes, but right ahead. No matter; my
life for it, it will shift ere morning. Let it but change a point or
two, and we shall lie our course. It comes&mdash;and fair at last, and,
rushing forward with augmenting speed, the gallant vessel disparts
the sparkling waters, and the keel cleaves the wave that keel never
cleft before; and objects fade, and objects rise, while, "like a thing
of life," the good ship hurries on. Cold must that spirit be which
owns no elemental influence, nor feels buoyant as the bark that bears
him onward to his destination!</p>

<p>As dinner ended, the altered motion of the yacht announced that
we had rounded Ushet Point, and left the shelter of the island. We
were now in the channel which separates Rathlin from the Scotch
coast, and the cutter felt the rising swell as her sharp bows plunged
in the wave, and flung it aside as if in scorn. The hissing noise with
which the smooth and coppered sides slipped through the yielding
waters marked our increased velocity. Yet we experienced little
inconvenience; on the morocco-cushioned sofa even a Roman might
have reclined in comfort. To every movement of the yacht the table
gave an accommodating swing: fragile porcelain and frail decanter
remained there in full security; and, though the wine-glass was filled
to the brim, the rosewood surface on which it stood was unstained by
a single drop. Human luxury cannot surpass that which a well-appointed
yacht affords.</p>

<p>When we left the cabin for the deck, a new scene and a new sky
were presented. Evening was closing in; the light blue clouds of
morning were succeeded by a dark and lowering atmosphere; the
wind was freshening, and it came in partial squalls, accompanied by
drizzling rain. Rathlin, and the Irish highlands were fading fast
away, while the tower on the Mull of Cantire flung its sparkling light
over the dark waters, as if soliciting our approach. Two or three
colliers we had passed, were steering for the Clyde close astern;
while a Glasgow steamer, bound for Derry, came puffing by, and in a
short time was lost in the increasing haze.</p>

<p>Is there on earth or sea an object of more interest or beauty than
that lone building which relieves the benighted voyager from his uncertainty?
In nothing has modern intelligence been more usefully
displayed than in the superior lighting of the British seas. Harbour,
and rock, and shoal, have each their distinguishing beacon; and, when
he once sees the chalk cliffs of his native island, the returning mariner
may count himself at home. Light after light rises from the murky
horizon: there, flaring with the brilliancy of a fixed star; here, meteor-like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
shooting out its stream of fire, and momentarily disappearing.
On, nothing doubting, speeds the adventurous sailor, until the anchor
falls from the bows, and the vessel "safely rides."</p>

<p>The light upon Cantire burns steadily, and in moderate weather it
is visible at the distance of fifteen miles. It stands high, being upwards
of two hundred and thirty feet above the level of the sea. We
skirted the base of the cliff it occupies, and steered for the little
island of Sanna. Momentarily the sea rose, the night grew worse, the
dim and hazy twilight faded away, the wind piped louder, and the
rain came down in torrents. When the weather looked threatening
the cutter had been put under easy canvass, and now a further reduction
was required. The mainsail was double-reefed, the third jib
shifted for a smaller one, all above and below "made snug," and on
we hurried.</p>

<p>The night was dark as a witch's cauldron when, rounding Sanna, we
caught the Pladda lights, placed on opposite towers, and bearing from
each other N. and S. It was easy to discover that we had got the
shelter of the land, as the pitching motion of the yacht changed to a
rushing velocity; but, though we found a smoother sea, the wind
freshened, the rain fell with unabated violence, and the breeze, striking
us in sudden gusts as it roared through the openings of the islands,
half-flooded the deck with a boiling sea that broke over the
bows, or forced itself through the lee-scuppers. Anxious to end our
dreary navigation, "Carry on!" was the word, and light after light
rose, and was lost successively. We passed the lights on Cumray;
and, presently, that on Toward, in Dumbarton, minutely revolving,
burst on the sight after its brief eclipse with dazzling brilliancy;
while from the opposite shores of the Frith the beacons of Air and
Trune were now and then distinctly visible. Our last meteor guide
told that our midnight voyage was nearly ended, and the pier-light
of Greenock enabled us to feel our way through a crowd of shipping
abreast the town. "Stand by, for'ard!&mdash;let go!" The anchor
fell, the chain went clattering through the hawse-hole; in a few seconds
the cutter swung head to wind, and there we were, safe as in a
wet dock!</p>

<p>We descended to the cabin, first discarding our outward coverings
at the foot of the companion ladder. We came down like mermen,
distilling from every limb, water of earth and sky in pretty equal proportions;
but, glory to the Prophet and Macintosh! Flushing petticoats,
pea-jackets, sou'westers, and India-rubber boots, proved garments
of such excellent endurance, notwithstanding a three hours' pitiless
pelting of spray and rain, that we shuffled off our slough, and
showed in good and dry condition, as if we had the while been snug
in the royal mail, or, drier yet, engaged at a meeting of the Temperance
Society. And then came supper,&mdash;they <em>can</em> cook in yachts!&mdash;and
we had run ninety miles since dinner; and that lobster salad, and
those broiled bones, with the joyous prospect which bottles of varied
tint upon yonder locker-head present, all would make&mdash;ay&mdash;a teetotaller
himself forswear his vows for ever.</p>

<p>All is snug for the night. The men have shifted their wet clothes,
and, as their supper is preparing, they crowd around the galley fire;
and jest and "laugh suppressed" are audible. What a change these
few brief minutes have effected! To the dreary darkness of a flooded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
deck, the luxury of this lighted and luxurious cabin has succeeded.
The wind whistles through the shrouds, the rain falls spattering on
the skylight,&mdash;what matter?&mdash;<em>we</em> heed them not; they merely recall
the discomfort of the past, which gives a heightened zest to the pleasure
of the passing hour. On rolled "the sandman" Time! the
dial's finger silently pointing at his stealthy course, and warning us
to separate.</p>

<p>Presently every sound below was hushed. All felt that repose
which comfort succeeding hardship can best produce. In my own
cabin I listened for a brief space to the growling of the storm; sleep
laid his "leaden mace upon my lids;" I turned indolently in my cot,
muttering with the honest Boatswain in the "Tempest,"</p>

<p class="linequot">"Blow till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!"</p>

<p>and next moment was "fast as a watchman."</p>

<p class="center f90">(<cite>Concluded from Vol. I. page 619.</cite>)</p>


<p>The board was spread. He sat at it abstracted for a time. The
dead silence of the place at last recalled him to himself. He was
alone! He sprang from his seat, and darted breathlessly to the
outward door! No one was in sight. Niall heaved a sigh that
seemed to rend his breast, as he wished that the eyes which looked in
vain were closed for ever. He returned to the table of repast; he took
a small chain of hair from his neck; he laid it on the cover that was
before him: he approached the door again. But the keepsake, that
had never left its seat for many a year, was too precious to him to be
so discarded. He returned: he lifted it, and, thrusting it into his
bosom, pressed it again and again to his heart, then again and again
to his lips, drinking his own tears, that fell fast and thick upon the
loved and about-to-be-relinquished token; he looked at it as well as
he could through his blinded eyes, convulsively sobbing forth the
name of Glorvina. He made one effort, as it were a thing which
called for all the power of resolution, to achieve that he desired to
accomplish; and, violently casting the gift of Glorvina down again, he
tore himself away!</p>

<p>Oh, the feet which retrace in disappointment the path which they
trod in hope, how they move! Through how different a region
do they bear us&mdash;and yet the same! Niall's limbs bore him from the
retreat of Glorvina as if they acted in obedience to a spirit repugnant
to his own. He cast his eyes this way and that way to divert
his thoughts from the subject that engrossed them, and fix them upon
the beauties of the landscape; but there was no landscape there.
Mountain, wood, torrent, river, lake, were obliterated! Nothing was
present but Glorvina. Rich she stood before him in the bursting
bloom of young womanhood! Features, complexion, figure, voice&mdash;everything
changed; and, oh, with what enhancing! Her eyes, in
which, four years before, sprightliness, frankness, kindness, and unconsciousness
used to shine,&mdash;what looked from them now? New
spirits! things of the soul which time brings forth in season. Expression,&mdash;that
face of the heart,&mdash;the thousand things that it told in
the moment or two that Niall looked upon the face of Glorvina! A
faintness came over the young man; his limbs seemed suddenly to
fail him; he felt as if his respiration were about to stop; he stood
still, he staggered, utter unconsciousness succeeded.</p>

<p>Niall opened his eyes. Slowly recollection returned. He was
aware that he had fainted, but certainly not in the place where he
was reclining,&mdash;a bank a few paces from the road. The repulse he
had met with from Glorvina returned to his recollection in full force.
He sighed, and thrust his hand into his bosom to press it to his overcharged
heart. His hand felt something there it did not expect
to meet! It drew forth the token of Glorvina! Niall could scarce
believe his vision. He looked again and again at the precious gift;
he pressed it to his lips; he thrust it into his breast; snatched it
thence to his lips again, and looked at it again; divided between incredulity
and certainty, past agony and present rapture. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
about him; no one was in sight. "How came it here?" exclaimed
he to himself. "Glorvina! Glorvina!" he continued, in tender accents,
"was it thy hand that placed it here? Hast thou been near
me when I knew it not? Didst thou follow me in pity,&mdash;perhaps,
O transporting thought! in kindness,&mdash;guessing from the untasted
repast and the abandoned pledge that Niall had departed in despair?
If so, then art thou still my own Glorvina! then shalt thou yet become
the wife of Niall!"</p>

<p>"The wife of Niall!" repeated the echo, and echo after echo took
it up.</p>

<p>Niall listened till the last reverberation died away.</p>

<p>"The wife of Niall!" he reiterated, in a yet louder voice, in the
tone of which exultation and joy were mingled.</p>

<p>"The wife of Niall!" cried the voice of the unseen lips.</p>

<p>"Once more, kind spirit!" exclaimed Niall; "once more!"</p>

<p>"Once more!" returned the echo.</p>

<p>"The wife of Niall!" ejaculated the youth, exerting his voice to its
utmost capacity; but he heard not the voice of the echo. The arms
of Glorvina were clasped about his neck, and her bright face was laid
upon his cheek!</p>

<p>"Companion of my childhood!&mdash;friend!&mdash;brother!" she exclaimed;
and would have gone on, but checked herself, looked in his eyes for a
moment, her forehead and her cheeks one blush, and buried her face
in his breast.</p>

<p>"Glorvina! Glorvina!" was all that Niall could utter in the intervals
of the kisses which he printed thick upon her shining hair.
"Glorvina! Glorvina!"</p>

<p>"Come!" said Glorvina, with a voice of music such as harp never
yet awakened; "come!" and straight led the way to her retreat.</p>

<p>Slow was their gait as they walked side by side, touching each
other. They spake not many words for a time. With the youth
all language seemed to be concentred in the name of Glorvina; in the
name of Niall with the maid. Suddenly Niall paused.</p>

<p>"How many a time," exclaimed Niall, "when I have been miles
and miles away, have I thought of the days when we used to walk
thus! only my arm used then to be around your waist, while yours
was laid upon my shoulder. Are we not the same Niall and Glorvina
we were then?" The maid paused in her turn. She hesitated,
but the next second her arm was on the shoulder of Niall; Niall's
arm was again the girdle of Glorvina's waist. Language began to
flow. Glorvina related minutely, as maiden modesty would permit
her, the cause of her secluded retirement and reported death. As
she spake, Niall drew her closer to him, and she shrank not; he
leaned his cheek to hers, and she drew not away; he drank her
breath as it issued in thrilling melody from her lips, and she breathed
it yet more freely; she ceased, and those lips were in contact with
his own, and not compulsively. Simultaneously Niall and Glorvina
paused once more; they gazed&mdash;they cast a glance of thankfulness
to heaven&mdash;gazed again&mdash;and, speechless and motionless, stood locked
in one another's arms.</p>

<p>"Glorvina!" cried a voice.</p>

<p>The maid started and turned. Malachi stood before his daughter,
the bard behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Niall!" said Malachi. The youth was at the feet of the king. In
a moment the maid was there also. Malachi stood with folded arms,
looking thoughtfully and somewhat sternly down upon the prostrate
pair. No one broke silence for a time.</p>

<p>The bard was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Malachi," said the bard, "what is so strong as destiny? Whose
speed is so swift? Whose foot is so sure? Who can outrace it, or
elude it? Thy stratagem is found out. The Dane asks for thy fair
child, although thou told'st him she was in the custody of the tomb.
If thou showest her not to him, he will search for her. Niall has
come in time. The voice of the prophetic Psalter has called him
hither; he has come to espouse thy fair child; a bride thou must present
her to the Dane. In the feast must begin the fray; by the fray
will the peace be begotten that shall give safety and repose to the
land. Malachi, reach forth thy hands! Lift thy children from the
earth, and take them to thy bosom; and bow thy head in reverence to
Fate!"</p>

<p>The aged king obeyed. He raised Glorvina and Niall from the
earth; he placed his daughter's hand in that of the youth: he extended
his arms; they threw themselves into them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bright shone the hall of Malachi at the bridal feast in honour of
the nuptials of Niall and Glorvina; rapturously it rang with the harp
and with the voice of many a minstrel; but the string of the bard was
silent; his thoughts were not at the board; his absent looks rebuked
the hour of mirth and gratulation; watchfulness was in them, and
anxiety, and alarm. Still the mirth halted not, nor slackened. The
king was joyous; on the countenances of Niall and Glorvina sat the
smile of supreme content; the spirits of the guests were quickening
fast with hilarity; and dancing eyes saluted every new visitor as he
entered,&mdash;for the gates of the castle were thrown open to all. Suddenly
the eyes of the whole assembly were turned upon the bard. He
had started from his seat, and stood in the attitude of one who listens.</p>

<p>"Hark!" he cried. He was obeyed. The uproar of the banquet
subsided into breathless attention; yet nothing was heard, though
the bard stood listening still. The feast was slowly renewed.</p>

<p>"Cormack," said Malachi, in a tone of mingled good-nature and
sarcasm, "what did you call upon us to listen to?"</p>

<p>"The sound of steps that come!" replied the bard with solemnity,
and slowly resuming his seat.</p>

<p>"It is the steps of thy fingers along the strings then!" rejoined the
king. "Come!&mdash;strike! A joyful strain!"</p>

<p>"No joyful strain I strike," said the bard, "till the land shall be
free from him whose footsteps now are turned towards thy threshold,
and shall cross it ere the feast is half gone by."</p>

<p>"No joyful strain thou'lt strike till then!" said the king. "Come,
take thy harp, old man, and show thy skill; and play not the prophet
when it befits thee to be the reveller!"</p>

<p>The bard responded not by word, action, or look, to the command
or request of Malachi. He sat, all expectation, on the watch for
something that his ear was waiting for.</p>

<p>"Nay, then," said the king, "an thou wilt not play the bard, whose
office 'tis, thy master will do it for thee!" and Malachi pushed back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
his seat, and reached to the harp, which stood neglected beside the
bard: he drew it towards him; his breast supported it; he extended
his arms, and spread his fingers over the strings. "Now!" said
Malachi.</p>

<p>"Now!" said the bard, starting up again, as the harsh blast of a
trumpet arrested the hand of the king on the point of beginning the
strain. Malachi started up too. All were upon their feet; and every
eye was fixed upon the portal of the hall, beneath which stood Turgesius
with a group of attendants.</p>

<p>"He is come!" said the bard. "The feast is not crowned without
the fray! He is come!" he repeated, as Malachi strode from his
place, and with extended hand approached the visitor, who smilingly
bowed to his welcome, and followed him to the head of the board,
round which he cast his eyes till they alighted upon Glorvina. Malachi
pointed to the seat beside himself, as Niall half gave place.</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;there!" said Turgesius, pointing to the side of Glorvina.
He approached the place where she sat with a cheek now as white as
her nuptial vest; the person next her mechanically resigned his seat,
and the rover took it.</p>

<p>"The cup!" cried Turgesius. It was handed to him. With kindling
eyes he lifted it, holding it for a second or two at full length;
then, turning his gaze upon the bride, he gave "The health of
Glorvina!"</p>

<p>"Glorvina!&mdash;Glorvina and Niall!" rang around the board. The
Dane started to his feet, snatching the cup from his lips, that were
about to touch it; and lifting it commandingly on high, "Glorvina!"
he repeated, casting a glance of haughty defiance round him; and,
taking a deep draught, with another glance at the company, sat
down, riveting his eyes upon the bride.</p>

<p>The cloud of wrath overcast the bright face of Niall as he watched
the licentious Dane. Frequently did he start, as upon the point of
giving way to some rash impulse, and then immediately check himself.
Now and then he looked towards the king, and turned away in
disappointment to see that Malachi thought of nothing but the feast,
and noted not the daring gaze which the rover kept bending on his
child. He looked round the board, and saw with satisfaction that he
was not the only one in whom festivity had given place to indignation;
and, with the smile of fixed resolve, he interchanged glances
with eyes lighted up with spirits like his own.</p>

<p>Turgesius plied the cup; and, as he drained it, waxed more and
more audacious. Regardless of the sufferings of the fair maid who
sat lost in confusion, he praised aloud the charms of Glorvina, and
gave utterance to the unholy passion with which they had inspired
him. Nor had he arrived at the limits of his presumption yet. He
caught her delicate hand, and held it in spite of her gentle, remonstrating
resistance. He dared to raise it to his lips, and hold it
there, covering it with kisses, till, the dread of consequences lost in
the dismay of outraged modesty, the royal maid by a sudden effort
wrested it from him, at the same time springing upon her feet with
the design of flying from the board; but the bold stranger, anticipating
her, was up as soon as she, and, grasping her by the rich swell
of her white arms, constrained her from departing.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Turgesius, bending his insolent gaze upon the now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
burning face and neck of Glorvina. "No! enchanting one! Thus
may not the Dane be served by the woman that inflames his soul
with love," and at the same moment attempted to throw his arms
around her.</p>

<p>"Desist, robber!" thundered forth the voice of Niall, and, at the
same moment, a goblet directed by his unerring aim stretched the
Dane upon the floor. Outcry at once took place of revelry. The
attendants of Turgesius, baring their weapons, rushed in the direction
of Niall, but stopped short at the sight of treble the number of their
glaives waving around him. They looked not for such hinderance.
Since the Dane had got the upper hand, the Irish youth had been
forbidden the practice or wearing of arms. They stopped, and stood
irresolute. The voice of the king restored order.</p>

<p>Malachi had hitherto sat strangely passive. He noted not the distress
of Glorvina, the audacity of the Dane, or the gathering wrath of
Niall; but the act of violence which had just taken place aroused
him from his abstraction. He rose; and, extending his hand, commanded
in a voice of impressive authority that the sword should be
sheathed, and the seats resumed. Then calling to his attendants, he
pointed to his prostrate guest, and signed to them to raise him, assisting
them himself, and giving directions that he should be conveyed
to his own chamber, and laid upon his own couch. This being performed,
he motioned to Glorvina to withdraw from the hall, which she
precipitately did, followed by her bridemaidens and other female
friends, and casting an anxious, commiserating look upon Niall, whose
wonder at the meaning of such a farewell was raised to astonishment,
when, turning towards the king, he encountered the stern, repelling,
and indignant gaze of Malachi.</p>

<p>"Niall!" said the king, in a voice of suppressed rage, "depart our
castle! Depart our realms! Withdraw from all alliance with our
house! Our honour has been stained by thee to-night in thy unparalleled
violation of the rights of hospitality. This roof never witnessed
before now, the person of a guest profaned by a blow from its
master, or from its master's friend. Consummation awaits not the
rites that have been performed to-day. The obligation of those rites
shall be dissolved! We mingle blood no further! Thou art henceforward
an alien&mdash;an outlaw; and at the peril of thy life thou crossest,
after this, our threshold, or the confines of our rule!" So saying,
Malachi resumed his seat, and sat pointing in the direction of the
door. Niall stood for a moment or two without attempting to move.
His countenance, his limbs, his tongue seemed frozen by dismay and
despair. At length he clasped his hands, and lifting them along with
his eyes, to heaven, turned slowly from the king, and strode from the
bridal feast.</p>

<p>Niall felt his cloak twitched as he issued from the portal. It was
the bard, who had quitted the hall before him, and remained waiting
for the young man.</p>

<p>"Niall," said the reverend man, "wilt thou now believe in the song
of Destiny? From the knowledge of the past confide for the future.
Hear what the Psalter saith:&mdash;'<em>The Dane shall rise from the couch,
and shall sit at the feast again; but in the fray that shall follow that
feast, he shall fall to rise no more.</em>' The mountains are lofty in Moran,
my son, where Slieve Dannard sits, with his feet in the sea, his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
in the cloud, and his back to the lake of the lonely shieling. Turn
thy steed thither! Lo, the sound of his feet! He is coming to receive
thee."</p>

<p>One on horseback appeared, leading another steed.</p>

<p>"Mount," cried the bard, "and be ready."</p>

<p>Niall was in the saddle. "Glorvina!" was all he could utter as
he wrung the old man's hand. Several others on horseback came
up. They were the friends of Niall, who had come to the bridal
feast.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried one of them.</p>

<p>"Not yet," interposed the bard. "There are more to join you.
Hear you not their horses' feet? You cannot be too many in company.
Listen!"</p>

<p>Another came up, and another.</p>

<p>"Spurs!" exclaimed the old man; and the band of friends were in
motion, and away. Little they spoke,&mdash;merely what sufficed to concert
a plan for future meetings; and they dropped off one by one as
the destination of each called him from the common track, till three
of the party were all that now remained together,&mdash;Niall and two
others.</p>

<p>"We may progress softly now," remarked one of his companions.
"We have crossed the boundaries of Meath, and half an hour will
bring my lord to the place where he is to rest."</p>

<p>In the voice of the speaker Niall recognised that of one of the
oldest of Malachi's household.</p>

<p>"The place where I am to rest?" echoed Niall.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," rejoined the other. "It has been prepared for you;
nor must you leave it till night sets in again. You will then forward
with all speed till you are met by those who expect you, and will
conduct you to where you must repose again. It will take you four
nights to reach your place of destination, whither I precede you."</p>

<p>"They who foresaw, have provided," said Niall, sighing.</p>

<p>"They have," responded the other.</p>

<p>"Had I been gifted with their reach of sight," exclaimed the
young man, "I should have provided too, and Glorvina were now at
my side! I would not have waited for the bridal feast! I would
have borne her away the moment the holy man had blessed us."</p>

<p>No further word was uttered, till, suddenly striking down a path
that belted a small wood, they came all at once upon a hut, at the
door of which they halted.</p>

<p>"Alight!" said Niall's guide.</p>

<p>Niall alighted, but the other kept his saddle; though his companion,
the third of the riders, had dismounted, unobserved by Niall
till now.</p>

<p>"And now, my lord, good night!" said he that remained on horseback.
"The door opens, and light streams from it. You see you
are expected. I leave one to wait upon you while I go forward to
make preparations for your further progress. So, again good night!"
added he, putting spurs to his steed.</p>

<p>Niall entered the hut, the hearth of which was blazing. He threw
himself into a seat before the fire, and looked around him. The door
of an inner apartment was open. He saw that a couch was ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
him, and such a one as he could hardly expect to meet with, in such
an abode.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said the owner of the hut,&mdash;an aged woman. "Come
in!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" inquired Niall.</p>

<p>"Thy companion stands without," replied the dame, "and will not
come in. Come in!" she repeated, but with no better success.</p>

<p>"Come in, friend," said Niall. "Nay," added he, "there is no
need of ceremony here;" and rising, went to the door, and reached
his hand to the other, who hesitatingly took it. "Whoever thou art,
we are companions for the time!" exclaimed Niall; "and, if they have
no other couch for thee, I will even give thee share of my own!"</p>

<p>Niall felt that his companion trembled as he pulled towards him
the hand that he held. A seat, hastily placed, received the figure,
which, but for the now supporting arms of Niall, would have fallen.
Niall quickly threw open the folds of an ample cloak to give the
owner air. What was his amazement to discover the form of a female!
His heart stopped for a second or two at the thought that
flashed across him! Another moment decided a question almost as
momentous to him as that of life or death, when, removing a hat
that was slouched over the face of the stranger, the bridegroom beheld
his bride! Niall gazed upon his Glorvina half-swooning in his
arms!</p>

<p>"Revive!&mdash;revive, my loved one! My own!&mdash;my bride!&mdash;my
wife!&mdash;my Glorvina!&mdash;revive!" rapidly ejaculated Niall. "Not so
bright breaks the sun out of the storm, as thou, sweetest, my vision
now! Where, a moment ago, could I have found, in my soul, hope&mdash;comfort&mdash;anything
that belongs to happiness?&mdash;and, lo! now it
overflows, full beyond measure with content&mdash;bliss&mdash;transport! Revive,
my Glorvina! Speak to me! Thy form is in my arms! They
feel that they surround thee, yet with a doubt. Assure me 'tis thyself!
Pour on my entranced ear the music of thy rich voice! Convince
me that it is indeed reality!&mdash;no dream&mdash;no vision&mdash;but Glorvina&mdash;my
own Glorvina encircled within my arms&mdash;enfolded to the
breast of Niall!"</p>

<p>Half-suspended animation became suddenly restored; the blood
rushed to the face and neck of the fair bride; she made an effort
as if she would be released from the embrace in which she sat locked,
but it resisted her. She desisted. She fixed her full eyes upon
her lover. Affection, and modesty, and honour, were blended in the
gaze which they bent upon him! The soul of Niall felt subdued.
His arms, gradually relaxing their pressure, fell from the lovely form
which they could have held prisoner for ever. He dropped on his
knee at her feet; he caught her hand, and pressed it to his lips with
the fervour and deference of duteous, idolizing love.</p>

<p>"Niall," said Glorvina, "I am thy bride; I have plighted my
troth to thee! Whatever be my worth,&mdash;in person, feature, heart,
and mind,&mdash;I am thine!&mdash;all thine!&mdash;thine, as the hand that now is
locked in thy own is a part of me! Yet&mdash;" She faltered, and her
eyes fell; and she raised them not again till she had concluded
what she meant to say. "Yet," she resumed, "I had not left my
father's roof this night to follow thee, but from the dread of outrage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
when thou wast no longer near me. I came with thee&mdash;unknown to
thee&mdash;for protection; for by thy side alone I feel security. I feel I
have a right to find it!&mdash;nowhere so entitled to it! nowhere so
sure to meet it!"</p>

<p>Glorvina ceased. Niall, still kneeling, kept gazing upon her face,
watching her lids till she would raise them. Slowly she lifted them,
as again and again he breathed her sweet name; till at length her
eyes encountered Niall's, beaming with reverence and love. He
drew her gently towards him. She did not resist. She bowed her
fair head till it rested on his shoulder; her arm half encircled his
neck! It was a moment of unutterable bliss,&mdash;yet but a moment!
The very next was one of alarm. The hoofs of a steed were heard.
Niall darted towards the door; his sword flew from its scabbard.</p>

<p>"Who comes?" he exclaimed, in a voice of defiance.</p>

<p>"A friend," replied the horseman; "but a friend who is the forerunner
of foes. You are pursued. I had only a dozen minutes the
start of them,&mdash;if so much! Listen to the words of one who loves
thee&mdash;the words of Cormack&mdash;of the bard. 'Tell him,' said he, 'thus
saith the Psalter:&mdash;<em>The land must obtain her freedom ere the bridegroom
his rights. What the altar shall grant must be enjoyed by
means of the sword!</em> Niall must journey on to the lake of the lonely
shieling! Thither shall gather to him the choice and true among
the sons of the land. Them shall he train in arms. Them shall he
bring with him to fetch his bride, long wedded ere a wife. Glorvina
must return! Niall stood confounded; but Glorvina was herself.
She rose from her seat. She approached the door, and listened.</p>

<p>"They are at hand!" she cried. "I hear their trampling. Niall,
I am resolved. 'Tis vain to resist fate. Its hand it is that severs
us for the present. Thy life is in peril if they find thee. I go to
meet them. I will thereby stop pursuit. Farewell!"</p>

<p>Niall heard not. Glorvina reached her hand to the horseman,
who helped her up behind him. Niall saw it not! She extended her
white arms towards him; he moved not. Once more she said farewell,
and not a word did he utter in reply. She departed. Niall
took no more note of her vanishing form, than the post of the door
against which he was leaning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Malachi impatiently awaited the return of those whom he had despatched
in pursuit of his daughter; whose flight, a Dane imposed
upon the confidence of Malachi as a spy, had betrayed to the king.
Sternly the father fixed his eyes upon his child as she entered; but
with amazement encountered looks as firm, as indignant as his own.
He forgot the reproaches that stood ready upon his lips. He gazed,
but spake not. Glorvina broke silence.</p>

<p>"Why hast thou taken back by force," said the maid, "what thou
gavest of free will? To whose custody behoves it thee to give thy
child&mdash;her husband's, or the ravisher's? Didst thou not sanction the
vow? Didst thou not say '<em>amen</em>' to the blessing? Why are they
then of no avail, and through thee? Did not thy command as a
father cease when thou resignedst me to a husband? Why is it then
resumed, and that husband alive? Did not the holy man pronounce
us one? Why stand I here then in thy castle without him by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
side? Love, honour, obedience, did I swear to render him; why
have I been constrained to desert him, and by the father too who
listened to the oath?"</p>

<p>The maiden paused. Malachi remained silent. Yet longer she
awaited his reply; still he spake not.</p>

<p>"Thou hast welcomed in thy hall," she resumed, "whom thou
shouldst have laid dead at thy threshold!" Her eyes now flashed as
she spoke. "Thou hast extended the hand where thou shouldst
have opposed the sword, though thou, and thine, and all allied to
thee, had perished by the sword. Thou, a king, hast made friends
with a robber, who, after stripping thy neighbours, advanced to plunder
thee; and holdest that friendship on at the risk of dishonour to
thy child,&mdash;whose modesty was outraged at thy board with impunity
from thee to the offender, and with injury to him who dared resent
the wrong. The dread of similar insult&mdash;if not of worse, stronger
than the opposition of maiden reserve, compelled that child&mdash;unasked,
unexpected, unpermitted&mdash;to fly for protection where protection
had been promised, accepted, and sanctioned, but never experienced
yet; and scarce had she found it when she was wrested from
it, and brought back&mdash;brought back to the hall which the spoiler,
whom she dreads, is as free to enter as she! And now&mdash;" She broke
off. The eyes of Malachi were fixed on the ground; confusion, and
care, and regret, were in his looks; a tear was trickling down his
cheek! The maiden essayed to go on, but could not. Resolution
wavered&mdash;it yielded more and more&mdash;it melted utterly away; she
rushed towards her father, and fell, kneeling at his feet, and dissolved
into tears. Malachi threw his arms around his child, lifted her to
his breast, and held her there, mingling his tears with hers; both unconscious
that Turgesius had entered the apartment, and stood glaring
upon them.</p>

<p>"She is found then?" said Turgesius. The father and child started,
and withdrew from one another's embrace. "'Tis well!" continued
he; "and now I will speak to thee what I have long borne in
my mind to tell thee. I love thy daughter."</p>

<p>Malachi stared at the Dane. His self-possession seemed to have
utterly left him. Not so was it with Glorvina. She drew her tall
and stately figure up till it towered again, as she stood collected with
an expression of calm scorn upon her brow and lip. Her eyes were
cast coldly down; her arms were folded upon her breast; she moved
no more than a statue.</p>

<p>"I love thy daughter," repeated the Dane impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well?" faltered forth Malachi.</p>

<p>"Well!" echoed the Dane. "Dost thou not comprehend my
speech? Is it not enough to say I love her? Need I tell thee I
would <em>have</em> what I love? Requirest thou such wasting of words?
Well, then, I love thy child, and desire that thou wilt give her to
me!"</p>

<p>Malachi mechanically moved his hand in the direction of his belt,
but his sword was not there. He rose&mdash;he advanced towards Turgesius&mdash;he
fixed upon him a look of fire&mdash;his lips trembling, and his
cheek wavering between red and pale, his hands clenched and trembling.
Turgesius in spite of himself drew back a pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dane," said the king, in the voice of rage suppressed, yet ready
to break forth, "dost thou ask me for the honour of my child? Dost
thou offer to bring shame upon the roof that has given thee welcome,
refreshment, and repose,&mdash;the roof of a king!&mdash;a king of ancient
line!&mdash;a warrior, and thy host!"</p>

<p>Turgesius stood momentarily abashed.</p>

<p>"Thy honour!" at length he cried, "the honour of thy child can
stand in no peril from me&mdash;a conqueror who profits wherever he
smiles!&mdash;whose favour is honour, wealth, life!" he added emphatically,&mdash;"life,
without which wealth and honour are of little avail!
Come!" continued he, suddenly grasping the wrists of the old king as
if in cordiality. "Come! Be no wrath between us! Thy armed
men are few, and those less thy subjects than my slaves! My bands
hover on the borders of thy kingdom; a part of them are here with
their master in the very heart of it. True thou hast said. Thou hast
been my host; thou hast received me as thy friend! I would not
thou shouldst turn me into thy foe; for little, as thou knowest, it
would avail thee. Talk not of things that are only imaginary, but
pay heed to those that are real; for it is they that concern thee
most. I love thy daughter. Give her to me, and 'tis well! Refuse
her to me, and it is well still&mdash;for I will have her!"</p>

<p>"Not with life in her!" exclaimed the frantic father, suddenly
freeing himself from the hold of the Dane, rushing up to his daughter,
plucking from her hair the large golden pin that held her tresses
up, and pointing it to her heart. Turgesius stood transfixed. Glorvina
never started nor flinched; but leaned her cheek forward upon
her father's breast, looking up in his face and smiling. The king arrested
his hand. The savage stood lost in amaze.</p>

<p>"I thank thee, O my father!" Glorvina at length exclaimed;
"thou lovest indeed thy child! It is destiny, and not thou, that has
afflicted her. But&mdash;listen to thy Glorvina. On one condition I consent
to leave thy hall, and present me at the castle of Turgesius to
await his pleasure."</p>

<p>"Name it, fair maiden!" cried Turgesius, his eyes sparkling up.</p>

<p>"Twenty fair cousins have I," resumed Glorvina, "whose beauty
far surpasses mine. They shall accompany me to the hold of Turgesius;
he shall compare them with me, and if he finds one among
them whom he prefers, her shall he take as my ransom. I doubt not
of their consent. In ten days we shall present ourselves at his gate.
Agrees he to wait that time, and retire to his hold till it expires?
The conqueror of a king is not unworthy a king's daughter!"</p>

<p>Malachi stared in amaze upon his child. Not so Turgesius. The
countenance of the libertine was lighted up with triumph. "Be it
so!" he exclaimed. "At the expiration of ten days I shall expect
thee, attended as thou promisest; but if thou exceedest the time the
half of another day, thou wilt not blame me, fair one, if I come to
fetch thee?" He then approached Malachi, and taking the hand of
the king without questioning whether it was given or not, shook it.
Glorvina's hand next endured his obtrusive courtesy. He clasped
it, raised it to his audacious lips, kissed it; and, turning exultingly
away, with confident tread strode down the hall, and, summoning
his attendants, departed from the castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ere a week had elapsed, the solitudes of Moran were peopled with
the youth of the adjacent country. From miles they gathered; one
spirit animating the breasts of all, one resolve,&mdash;to free the land, or
perish! Readily they placed themselves under the command of
Niall. He had won fame even while yet a boy. Then he had no
competitor in the feats of strength or dexterity; while his ever-modest,
generous bearing, divested defeat of chagrin on the part of the
unsuccessful. Since then, he had sojourned with the Saxon, whose
art of warfare he had thoroughly mastered, trained by the greatest
captain of that nation. With avidity his young countrymen availed
themselves of his instructions, and learned a mode of attack and defence
superior to that they had hitherto known. They practised incessantly
the advance, the retreat, the wheel, the close and open
order, the line, and the square, the use of the javelin, the sword, and
the shield. Hour after hour their numbers swelled. The first quarter
of the moon had witnessed the commencement of their gathering;
the fourth looked upon them, a host prepared, and almost equal
to give battle to the Dane.</p>

<p>"Welcome, son of Cuthell!" exclaimed Niall, to a youth who, on
a steed of foam, drew near. "Welcome! You see what a company
we have here to greet you," continued he. "You see how we banquet!
You like our revelry, and are come to make one among us!
You are welcome, son of Cuthell! right welcome!"</p>

<p>The youth gazed with wonder upon the bands that, reclined upon
the borders of the lake of the lonely shieling, were enjoying a moment's
repose in an interval of practice; then, turning upon Niall a
look full of sad import, alighted, took him kindly by the hand, and
led him yet further apart from the companions of his exile.</p>

<p>"Niall!" began the young man, "it is a stout heart that defies the
point of the spear, or the edge of the glaive; but greater is the fortitude
that cowers not before the unseen weapons of misfortune. My
soul is heavy with the tidings that I bring. Shall I speak them?
Will Niall hear them, and not allow his manly spirit to faint?"</p>

<p>"Speak them!" said Niall. "Stay! Whom concern they? The
evil thou wouldst avert hath nearly come to pass. My soul sickens
already! To whom do the tidings relate that demand such preparation?
To whom <em>can</em> they relate but to Glorvina?" The head of
Niall dropped upon his breast.</p>

<p>"Injury," rejoined the other, "hath ever its solace with the brave,&mdash;revenge!"</p>

<p>"It has!" exclaimed Niall, rearing his head, and directing towards
his friend a glance of fire. "Is the maid in danger, or hath she suffered
wrong? the wedded maid that plighted her troth to Niall: the
bride that has not pressed the bridal couch?"</p>

<p>"The couch that she shall press with another," resumed the young
man, "is spread for her in the castle of Turgesius!" He paused,
alarmed at the looks of Niall, from whose face the blood had fled.</p>

<p>"Go on!" said Niall, after a time, articulating with difficulty; and,
with clenched hands, folding his arms tightly upon his breast. "Go
on!" he repeated, observing that the young man hesitated. "Tell
me the whole! It is worse, I see, than I feared; but go on! Keep
nothing from me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Turgesius has demanded thy bride for his mistress, and Glorvina&mdash;&mdash;"
The son of Cuthell stopped short, as if what was to follow
was more than he had fortitude to give utterance to.</p>

<p>"Has consented?" interrogated Niall, with a look of furious distraction.</p>

<p>"Has consented," rejoined the young man,</p>

<p>Niall stood transfixed for a minute or two; then smote his forehead
fiercely with his hand, groaned, and cast himself upon the
earth.</p>

<p>The son of Cuthell left him to himself for a time. He spake
not to him till he saw that his passion had got vent in tears; then
he accosted him.</p>

<p>"Revenge," said he, "stands upon its feet. It braces its arm for
the blow! Not to see thee thus did I spur my steed into foam soon
as I learned the news. Within a month did Glorvina promise to
surrender herself to the arms of the rover. Five days remain unexpired.
Up! Call thy friends around thee! inform them of the
wrong, the dishonour that awaits thee. Ask them to avenge thee.
Not a spear but will be grasped; not a foot but will be ready! You
shall march upon the castle of Malachi. You shall demand your
bride. You shall have her!"</p>

<p>Niall sprang from the ground; he hastened towards his bands;
his looks and pace spoke the errand of wrath and impatience. His
friends were on their feet without the summons of his tongue. They
simultaneously closed around him when he drew near, eagerness
and inquiry in their eyes, whose sparkling vouched for spirits that
were not slow to kindle.</p>

<p>Niall told what he came to say; no voice replied to him. Silently
the warriors formed themselves into the order of march; then
turned their eyes upon Niall, waiting his command. He raised his
sword aloft, and his eyes went along with it, followed by the eyes of
all his little host. Slowly he bent the knee. Not a knee besides
but also kissed the earth.</p>

<p>"To Meath!" exclaimed Niall, springing up.</p>

<p>"To Meath!" shouted every warrior, as the whole stood erect.</p>

<p>Niall placed himself in the van; he moved on; they followed
him.</p>

<p>The last morning of the month lighted up the towers of Malachi;
but gloomy was the brow of their lord. He paced his hall with
hurried steps, every now and then casting an uneasy glance towards
the door that communicated with the interior of the castle. The
bard was seated near the exterior portal, his harp reclining on his
breast, his arms extended across his frame, his fingers spread over its
strings. Lively and loud was the chord that he struck, and bold was
the strain that he began.</p>

<p>"What kind of strain is that?" demanded the king, suddenly stopping,
and directing towards the aged man a look of reproachful displeasure.</p>

<p>"The strain befits the day and the deed," replied the bard, and
went on.</p>

<p>"Peace!" commanded Malachi.</p>

<p>"Not till the feet are announced," rejoined the bard, "that bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the strife which maketh peace;" and he resumed the strain with new,
redoubled fire, nor paused till the portal resounded with the summons
of one impatient for admittance.</p>

<p>The portal opened. Pale and breathless was he that passed in.</p>

<p>"Thy news?" demanded Malachi.</p>

<p>He whom he accosted tried to find utterance, but could not. He
had come in speed; his strength and breath were exhausted. He
stood for a minute or two, tottering; then staggered towards a seat.</p>

<p>"A friend is coming," said the bard; "but he wears the face
of a foe. Nor does he come alone; but prepared to demand what
was forbidden;&mdash;to take what was withheld. Niall, with a host of
warriors, is at thy gate. Thy bands that watch thy foe have left thy
friend free to approach thee; but he comes in the form of the
avenger."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the bard pronounced the last word when the hall
was half filled with armed men; Niall at their head. Jaded, yet
fierce, were his looks. He strode at once up to the king, and stood
silent for a time, confronting him.</p>

<p>"Niall!" said the king, confounded; and paused.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Niall, "it is I! the son-in-law of thy own election,
come to demand his rights! Where is my bride, king of
Meath? Where is thy daughter? the wedded maid who, denied
to the arms of her bridegroom, has consented to surrender herself
to unhallowed embraces! O, Malachi! accursed was the day when
thou gavest welcome to the stranger, whose summons at thy gate was
the knock which he gave with the hilt of his sword,&mdash;was the blast
of the horn of war! Low lies the glory of thy race! From the
king of a people art thou shrunk into the minion of a robber, who,
not content with making a mockery of thy crown, brings openly
pollution to thy blood! Where is thy child? Does the roof of
her father still shelter her head? or does she hang it in shame
beneath that of Turgesius? Where is she? Reply, O king, and
promptly! for desperation grasps the weapons that we bring, and
which we have sworn shall receive no sheaths at our hands but the
breasts of those who dishonour us!"</p>

<p>So spake the youth, his glaive in his hand, his frame trembling
with high-wrought passion, his eye flashing, and his cheek on fire
with the hectic of rage, when Glorvina entered the hall.</p>

<p>She did not hang her head; she bore it proudly erect. A tiara
of gems encircled her brow; fair fell a robe of green from her graceful
shoulders. A girdle of gold round her waist confined the folds of
her under-dress, swelling luxuriantly upwards and downwards, and
falling to within an inch of her ankles, each of which a palm of a
moderate span might encircle. She advanced three or four paces
into the apartment, right in the direction of Niall, and then stood
still; still fixing her eyes steadily upon her bridegroom with an
expression in which neither defiance nor deprecation, neither reproach
nor fear, neither recklessness nor shame, but love&mdash;all love&mdash;was
apparent. Niall scarcely breathed! An awe came over his
chafed spirit as he surveyed his bride. The more he looked, the
more the clouds of wrath rolled away from his soul, until not a vestige
of tempest remained. He uttered tenderly the name of Glorvina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
He cast down his eyes in repentant humility; he approached
her, half hesitating, without raising them. He sank on his knee at
her feet; Glorvina recoiled at the posture of her lover. She extended
her shining arms; she caught his hands in hers; she almost
raised him herself from the earth, and vanished with him from
the hall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Dane looked from the ramparts at his castle. Twenty of his
chiefs&mdash;the choicest&mdash;were about him. Expectation was painted in
the looks of all. Their eyes were directed towards the same
quarter.</p>

<p>"They come!" at length exclaimed Turgesius. "The maiden
hath kept her word. Yonder they issue from the wood!"</p>

<p>"Those are soldiers!" remarked one.</p>

<p>"Her attendants," rejoined Turgesius; "she comes as a royal
maiden should!"</p>

<p>"Then she is well attended. I'll answer for a hundred spears
already; and more are coming on."</p>

<p>"Let them!" said Turgesius. "Though they double the number,
it were but twenty for each fair virgin, and the princess to go without.
Turn out our bands, that we may receive them with all due
courtesy!"</p>

<p>Turgesius and his chiefs descended; they issued from the castle-gate;
the bands of the Dane were drawn up ready to give salutation
to the visitors. The Irish party drew near; they halted within
fifty paces of the walls, and, unfolding their ranks, presented to the
eyes of the Dane, Glorvina and her kinswomen, faithful to the appointment
of the royal maid. All were veiled. Turgesius and his
chiefs approached them; and Glorvina, when they drew near, removed
the thick gauze from her face.</p>

<p>"Chieftain!" she spake, "I am here to keep my word. Conduct
us into thy castle. Compare me there with my kinswomen. If thou
findest amongst them, her whom thou deemest more deserving thy
love than I, accept her in place of me, and let me return to my
father."</p>

<p>"Be it so!" said Turgesius, casting a significant glance around
him upon his chiefs; and led the way, Glorvina and her companions
following.</p>

<p>They passed into the hall of banquet. Turgesius led Glorvina to
the head of the board, but not to place her there. He turned; and,
as she looked down the chamber along with him, she saw that his
chiefs had likewise entered it, and her respiration became difficult,
and a chill passed over her frame.</p>

<p>"Chiefs!" cried Turgesius, "you see what choice of beauty the
bounty of Malachi has presented to your lord; but he cares not to
avail himself of it. He asks not a damsel even to remove her veil,
content with the charms of the fair Glorvina. Her does he lead to
the banquet which has been prepared for her within. Welcome ye
the daughters of Meath! Leave them no cause to tax the sons of
the Dane with want of gallantry." Turgesius took the hand of
Glorvina.</p>

<p>"Stay!" interposed the maid: "the Irish maiden sits not at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
banquet with the glaive in the girdle of the warrior; for the cup engenders
ire as well as mirth, and blood may flow as well as wine.
Before my kinswomen withdraw their veils, let thy chieftains deposit
their weapons without the hall, and each as he returns accept the first
maiden that commits herself to his courtesy, and conduct her to her
seat, nor ask her to remove the guard of modesty till all are in their
places."</p>

<p>The chiefs waited not for the reply of Turgesius. They passed
quickly out of the hall; they returned unarmed. All was performed
as Glorvina prescribed. She waited not for the invitation of Turgesius.
Of her own accord she entered the apartment prepared for the
rover and herself. Closely he followed her. The door was closed
after him. He sprang towards her, and caught her to his breast. She
shrieked, and disengaged herself. Again he approached her; but
stopped short at the sight of a dagger, which gleamed in her hand.</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried Glorvina.</p>

<p>Her injunction was unneeded: sounds, not of revelry but of anguish,
proceeded from the hall, with a noise as of heavy weights cast
violently upon the floor. Turgesius grew pale. His eyes glared with
alarm and inquiry.</p>

<p>"Listen!" again cried the maid. Sounds came from without as
though the storm of battle were on. Turgesius waxed paler still.
Surprise and terror seemed to have bereft him of the power of motion.
He shook from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Behold!" exclaimed Glorvina, as the door of the apartment was
burst open, and Niall presented himself, grasping a reeking brand.
The robber tottered. Life was almost extinct as the youth, twisting
his hand in the grey hairs of Turgesius, dragged him from the apartment
to his doom.</p>

<p>Not a Dane survived that day.</p>

<p>A second bridal feast graced the hall of Malachi. Niall and Glorvina
were the bridegroom and the bride. The bard sat beside them
with his harp; but that harp was not silent now, nor sad. No guest
unbidden came to the door of that hall. No fray turned the tide of
their revelry. And when the bright Glorvina retired, with downcast
eyes and crimsoned cheek, the bridegroom himself arose, and,
bowing to the king, lifted the brimming cup, and, having cast his
eyes around the board, drank</p>

<p class="center smcap">"To Glorvina, the Heroine of Meath!"</p>

<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY GEORGE HOGARTH.</p>

<h3>No. II.</h3>


<p>Our Scottish Solomon, King James the First, amongst other instances
of wisdom, was especially addicted to favourites. During his
whole reign he was governed by a succession of minions. His prime
favourite, Buckingham, (the celebrated "Steeny,") was preceded in
his affections by a man little less remarkable, the Earl of Somerset.
Robert Carr, a young man of a respectable Scotch family, appeared
at court very soon after James's accession to the English crown. At
a tilting-match, where the king was present, Carr by an accident
was thrown from his horse, and had his leg broken. The king, who
had been struck with his handsome figure, made him be attended by
his own surgeons, visited him daily, and soon became immoderately
fond of his society. The young favourite did not neglect the means
of advancement; before many months were over he was knighted
and made a gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time became
all-powerful at court. There is a letter from Lord Thomas
Howard to Sir John Harrington, written about the year 1608, which
shows the feelings of the courtiers upon the subject. "Carr," says
the writer, "hath all the favours, as I told you before. The king
teacheth him Latin every morning, and I think some one should
teach him English too; for he is a Scottish lad, and hath much need
of better language. The king doth much covet his presence: the
ladies, too, are not behind hand in their admiration; for, I tell you, good
knight, this fellow is straight-limbed, well-favoured, and smooth-faced,
with some sort of cunning and show of modesty, though, God wot,
he well knoweth when to show his impudence. Your lady is virtuous,
and somewhat of a good housewife; has lived in a court in her time,
and I believe you may venture her forth again; but I know those
would not so quietly rest, were Carr to leer on their wives, as some do
perceive, yea, and like it well too they should be so noticed. If any
mischance be to be wished, 'tis breaking a leg in the king's presence;
for this fellow owes all his favour to that bout. I think he hath better
reason to speak well of his own horse than the king's roan jennet.
We are almost worn out in our endeavours to keep pace with this
fellow in his duty and labour to gain favour, but in vain; where it
endeth I cannot guess, but honours are talked of speedily for him."
These honours speedily followed, Carr having been soon afterwards
created Viscount Rochester.</p>

<p>Robert, Earl of Essex, the son of the unfortunate favourite of
Queen Elizabeth, had married, in the year 1603, the Lady Frances
Howard, eldest daughter of the Earl of Suffolk. The earl was only
fourteen, and his bride a year younger. Immediately after the marriage
the young earl was sent abroad on his travels, the countess remaining
at court,&mdash;of which she was one of the brightest ornaments.
Under a form, however, of singular loveliness, she concealed a mind
of not less singular depravity. When Essex returned, after a few
years' absence, he found her affections quite estranged from him. She
had conceived a passion for the handsome favourite, and received her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
husband with contemptuous coldness; while she endeavoured, by her
arts and allurements, to captivate the object of her guilty flame. To
these means she added others more peculiarly characteristic of the
age. There was a woman of the name of Turner, a servant or dependant
of the countess's family, and with whom she appears to have
associated much in her childhood and youth. This woman was of an
atrocious character, and soon succeeded in making her patroness as
wicked as herself. Mrs. Turner, as well as the countess, had an
illicit amour; and they were in the habit of resorting to a Dr. Forman,
a celebrated quack and dealer in magic, in order, by means of love-philters
and conjurations, to obtain the objects of their wishes.</p>

<p>Whether Dr. Forman's charms prevailed, or the countess's own
were sufficient, Rochester was soon caught; and a guilty <em>liaison</em> was
formed between them.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Overbury was then Lord Rochester's secretary. He
was an able and accomplished man, in the prime of life, of a bold and
aspiring disposition; and, being high in the good graces of the reigning
favourite, appeared to be on the road to political distinction. To
the raw youth, who had had "greatness thrust upon him" so rapidly,
the services of a man of parts and experience were invaluable; and
Overbury, by acting as the guide and counsellor of the favourite, directed,
in a great measure, the movements of majesty itself.</p>

<p>Rochester made Overbury the confidant of his intrigue with Lady
Essex; and the secretary, in order to pay his court to his patron, encouraged
and assisted him in the prosecution of it. He even composed
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets-doux</i> which the illiterate lover sent to his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">inamorata</i>.</p>

<p>The countess, not content with the clandestine indulgence of her
adulterous passion, now conceived the idea of getting rid of her husband.
The intercourse between her and Rochester had become so
shameless and open that it was loudly talked of by the world; and it
appeared evident that a divorce from her husband, followed by a marriage
with her lover, was the only way to prevent their separation.
The countess, therefore, instituted proceedings against her husband
for a divorce, on grounds to which only a shameless and abandoned
woman could think of resorting. The favourite gained the king's
sanction and support to this scandalous suit; and, after a course of
procedure which is a disgrace to the judicature of that age, a sentence
of divorce was pronounced by judges influenced and intimidated
by the king himself, whose interference was grossly arbitrary
and indecent. Within six weeks after the divorce, Lady Essex was
married to Rochester, whom the king had previously created Earl of
Somerset.</p>

<p>While his patron's connexion with Lady Essex was merely an adulterous
intrigue, Overbury had no objection to it; but he seems to
have been shocked and frightened at the idea of Lord Rochester's
marrying a woman of whose atrocious character he was well aware.
He, therefore, earnestly dissuaded Rochester from this marriage.
One night, when they were walking together in the gallery at Whitehall,
Overbury made use of the most earnest remonstrances.</p>

<p>"Well, my lord," he said, "if you do marry that base woman you
will utterly ruin your honour and yourself. You shall never do it by
my advice, or with my consent; and, if you do, you had best look to
stand fast."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"My own legs are strong enough to bear me up," cried Rochester,
stung with such language applied to a woman whose fascinations retained
all their power over him; "but, in faith, I will be even with
you for this." So saying, he flung away in a rage, and left the place.
The conference was terminated with such heat that the words of the
speakers were overheard by persons in an adjoining room, who soon
had cause to remember them.</p>

<p>Rochester allowed his resentment apparently to subside, and treated
his secretary as before. He even requested the king, as a mark
of favour, to appoint Overbury ambassador to Russia. The king
complied; and Overbury accepted the appointment with great alacrity.
But this act of kindness, as it seemed to be, on the part of Somerset,
was the first step to a deep and deadly revenge for the insult
to the woman whom he had resolved to marry, and whose fury he had
roused by informing her of what had passed.</p>

<p>Having allowed Overbury to accept the office which he had procured
for him, Somerset now advised him to decline it. "If you
serve as ambassador," he said, "I shall not be able to do you so
much good as if you remain with me. If you are blamed, or even
committed for refusing," he added, "never mind: I will take care
that you meet with no harm." Overbury, in an evil hour, listened to
this perfidious counsel, sent his resignation to the king, and was instantly
sent to the Tower.</p>

<p>Sent to the Tower for declining to accept an office! Even so.
Such was the "Divine right" of an absolute king, in England, in the
seventeenth century. Without even the shadow, or the accusation,
of a crime, Sir Thomas Overbury was immured in a dungeon, because
he declined the honour of being sent as ambassador to Russia.</p>

<p>This act of tyranny was committed at the instigation of the favourite;
and Overbury, in the Tower, was entirely in the hands of his
enemies. Somerset, in the first place, obtained from the king the
dismissal of the lieutenant of the Tower, and the appointment, in his
stead, of Sir Jervis Elwes, one of Somerset's creatures. One Richard
Weston, who had been shopman to an apothecary, was made under-keeper,
and specially charged with the custody of Overbury. This
man had been an agent of Lady Essex in her secret transactions with
Dr. Forman and Mrs. Turner, and in affording opportunities for her
guilty meetings with Lord Rochester at Mrs. Turner's house, and
elsewhere, and was quite ready to perpetrate any deed of darkness
which they might desire. Weston, thus become Overbury's keeper,
confined him so closely that he was scarcely permitted to see the
light of day; and debarred him from all intercourse with his family,
relations, and friends.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The associates in wickedness lost no time in commencing their
operations on their victim, whom they had determined to destroy by
degrees, so as to prevent suspicion. Weston, on the very day he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Overbury's keeper, administered to him a slow poison, provided
by Mrs. Turner; and, from that time, some poisonous substance
was mingled with every article of food or drink which was given him.
"He never ate white salt," said one of the witnesses on the trials
which afterwards took place, "but there was white arsenic put into
it. Once he desired pig, and Mrs. Turner put into it <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lapis costitus</i>
(lunar caustic). At another time he had two partridges sent him
from the court; and water and onions being the sauce, Mrs. Turner
put in cantharides instead of pepper; so that there was scarce any
thing that he did eat but there was some poison mixed."</p>

<p>Under such treatment Overbury's constitution (which seems to
have been of extraordinary strength) began to give way. Relying
on Rochester's promise, that his refusal to accept the embassy should
bring him to no harm, he daily expected his release. After remaining
in this state for three or four weeks, he wrote to Rochester,
urging him to remember his promise, and received for answer that
"the time would not suffer; but, as soon as possible might be, he
would hasten his delivery;" a promise which he certainly intended to
fulfil, though not in the sense in which it was meant to be understood.
By way of "hastening his delivery," Rochester sent him a
letter, containing a white powder, which he desired him to take. "It
will," he said, "make you more sick; but fear not: I will make this
a means for your delivery, and the recovery of your health." Unsuspicious
of treachery, Overbury took the powder, which acted upon
him violently, and (as he indeed expected) increased his sickness.
Weston afterwards confessed that it was arsenic.</p>

<p>In this situation Overbury languished for two months, growing
worse and worse. His suspicions being now, to some extent, awakened,
he wrote to Rochester: "Sir,&mdash;I wonder you have not yet found
means to effect my delivery; but I remember you said you would be
even with me, and so indeed you are: but, assure yourself, my lord,
if you do not release me, but suffer me thus to die, my blood will be
required at your hands." Overbury appears to have remembered
Rochester's threat that he would be even with him for the manner
in which he had spoken of Lady Essex; but never seems to have
dreamed that more was meant than to punish him by a protracted imprisonment.
He therefore was satisfied with the explanations and
excuses sent him by Lord Rochester, who affected, at the same time,
to show the utmost anxiety for his comfort. He was daily visited by
creatures of Lord Rochester and Lady Essex, who delivered him encouraging
messages from Rochester, and pretended to furnish him
with various comforts in the articles of food and drink, which he could
not otherwise have had in the Tower. To gratify a sickly appetite
he expressed a wish for tarts and jellies, which were provided by
Mrs. Turner, and sent to Elwes, the lieutenant of the Tower, to be
given to Overbury, by Lord Rochester and Lady Essex. These sweetmeats
were not poisoned at first; but the poisoned ones were accompanied
by a letter from Lady Essex to Elwes, in which she said,
"I was bid to tell you that in the tarts and jellies there are <em>letters</em>, but
in the wine none; and of that you may take yourself, and give your
wife, but, of the other, not. Give him these tarts and jelly this night,
and all shall be well." The meaning of the word, <em>letters</em>, is sufficiently
evident; but the countess afterwards removed any doubt on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the subject, by confessing, on her trial, that "by <em>letters</em> she meant
poison." Rochester appears to have been then residing at some little
distance from town; for Lady Essex was the immediate agent in
these transactions, and carried on a correspondence with Rochester
on the subject. In one of his letters to her he expressed his wonder
"that things were not yet despatched;" on which she sent instructions
to Weston to despatch Overbury quickly. Weston's answer
was, that he had already given him as much as would poison twenty
men. Still, however, the victim survived. He was now reduced to
extremity; but the patience of his destroyers was exhausted, and
they put an end to his sufferings by a dose of corrosive sublimate.
He died in October 1613, having been for nearly six months in their
hands. His body, carelessly wrapped in a sheet, was buried in a pit
on the very day of his death, without having been seen by any of his
friends, or the holding of a coroner's inquest; though, as Elwes admitted
on his trial, the duty of the lieutenant of the Tower was, that
if any prisoner died there, his body was to be viewed, and an inquisition
taken by the coroner. These circumstances excited suspicion,
and Overbury's relations were persuaded to take some steps towards
the prosecution of an inquiry: but the attempt was defeated by the
power and influence of the noble criminals.</p>

<p>The marriage between Rochester, now Earl of Somerset, and Lady
Essex, took place in February 1614, four months after the close of
this tragedy. It was celebrated with a pomp and splendour more befitting
the nuptials of a prince than those of a subject. The king
himself gave away the bride. A masque, according to the fashion
of the times, was exhibited by the courtiers, and another by the
gentlemen of Gray's Inn; their repugnance to this act of sycophancy
having been overcome, it is said, by the persuasions of Bacon,&mdash;a
man whose moral deficiencies formed a strange contrast to his almost
superhuman vastness of intellect. A splendid banquet, too, was
given by the City, at which the king, queen, and all the court, were
present. But the public knew enough of the open profligacy of this
brilliant pair to look upon them with indignation,&mdash;a feeling accompanied
with abhorrence of the dark deeds already strongly suspected.</p>

<p>Somerset was now at the height of his greatness; but he no
longer possessed the qualities which had gained him the king's favour.
His appearance and manners underwent a total change. His
countenance became care-worn and haggard; his dress neglected;
his manners morose and gloomy. The alteration was apparent to
all; and the king became weary of one who no longer ministered to
his amusement. His majesty had now, too, found a new favourite,&mdash;George
Villiers, afterwards the famous Duke of Buckingham, who
gained James's affections by the same means as Somerset himself had
done,&mdash;a handsome person, graceful manners, quick parts, and courtly
obsequiousness. These two men became rivals and enemies. Somerset
was universally odious from his arrogance and rapacity; and
Villiers was looked upon with favour as the probable instrument of
his fall. Somerset, now aware of his danger, and trembling for the
discovery of his guilt when he might no longer have the king for a
protector, availed himself of his remaining influence with James to
obtain from him a pardon for all past offences. This he begged as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
safeguard against the consequences of any errors into which he might
have fallen in the high offices which he had held, and the secret and
important affairs with which it had been his majesty's pleasure to intrust
him. Strange to say, the king signed a document, whereby he
pardoned "all manner of treasons, misprisions of treasons, murders,
felonies, and outrages whatsoever, committed, or to be committed,"
by Somerset. But, when this deed was carried to the Lord Chancellor,
he absolutely refused to affix the great seal to it, declaring it to
be absolutely illegal. No importunity could prevail on him to yield;
and Somerset remained without the shield with which he had endeavoured
to provide himself.</p>

<p>The rivalry between the favourites went on increasing; but the
Earl of Somerset's rank and standing still gave him the ascendancy.
The king wished them reconciled; and, for this purpose, desired
Villiers to wait on Somerset with a tender of his duty and attachment.
But the haughty earl, though he had received a hint that the
king expected this offer to be graciously received, spurned at it. "I
will none of your service," was his answer, "and you shall none of my
favour. I will, if I can, break your neck, and of that be confident."
It was immediately after this interview that an inquiry was set on
foot into the circumstances of Overbury's murder; and the supposition
of a contemporary writer is not improbable, that, "had Somerset
complied with Villiers, Overbury's death had still been raked up in his
own ashes."</p>

<p>The first step that appears to have been taken in this inquiry was
a private examination of Sir Jervis Elwes, the lieutenant of the
Tower, by the king himself, who piqued himself on his skill in conducting
judicial investigations; in which, indeed, he had acquired
great experience during his turbulent reign in Scotland. Pressed by
the king's questions, Elwes admitted his knowledge of Weston's intention
to poison his prisoner, but denied his own participation in the
crime. Weston, being apprehended and examined, admitted circumstances
which involved Mrs. Turner, and the Earl and Countess of
Somerset. The king issued his warrant for the commitment of the
earl and countess to private custody, which was executed on the
15th October 1615. The circumstances attending this arrest, as related
by a contemporary, Sir Anthony Weldon, in his "<em>Court and
Character of King James</em>," are curious, and characteristic of that
monarch.</p>

<p>"The day," says this writer, "the king went from Whitehall to
Theobald's, and so to Royston, the king sent for all the judges, (his
lords and servants encircling him,) where, kneeling down in the
midst, he used these words:&mdash;'My lords the judges, it is lately
come to my hearing that you have now in examination a business of
poisoning. Lord, in what a miserable condition shall this kingdom
be, (the only famous nation for hospitality in the world,) if our tables
should become such a snare as none could eat without danger of life,
and that Italian custom should be introduced among us! Therefore,
my lords, I charge you, as you will answer it at that great and dreadful
day of judgment, that you examine it strictly, without favour, affection,
or partiality; and, if you shall spare any guilty of this crime,
God's curse light on you and your posterity; and, if <em>I</em> spare any that
are guilty, God's curse light on me and my posterity for ever!'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall presently see how his majesty kept this solemn vow, uttered
in such awful terms. "The king, with this," continues Weldon,
"took his farewell for a time of London, and was accompanied
with Somerset to Royston, where, no sooner he brought him, but instantly
took leave, little imagining what viper lay among the herbs;
nor must I forget to let you know how perfect the king was in the
art of dissimulation, or, to give it his own phrase, kingcraft. The
Earl of Somerset never parted from him with more seeming affection
than at this time, when he knew Somerset would never see
him more; and, had you seen that seeming affection,&mdash;as the author
himself did,&mdash;you would rather have believed he was in his rising
than setting. The earl, when he kissed his hand, the king hung
about his neck, slabbering his cheeks, saying, 'For God's sake, when
shall I see thee again? On my soul I shall neither eat nor sleep until
you come again.' The earl told him 'On Monday,'&mdash;this being the
Friday. 'For God's sake, let me!' said the king. 'Shall I? shall I?'
then lolled about his neck. 'Then, for God's sake, give thy lady this
kiss for me!' In the same manner at the stairs' head, at the middle
of the stairs, and at the stairs' foot. The earl was not in his coach
when the king used these very words in the hearing of four servants,
one of whom was Somerset's great creature, and of the bed-chamber,
who reported it instantly to the author of this history; 'I shall never
see his face more.'"</p>

<p>It afterwards appeared that, when Somerset returned to London,
he found that his wife had received the fatal tidings of Weston's apprehension.
There was an apothecary of the name of Franklin who
had been employed by the countess and Mrs. Turner to procure the
poisons. At a late hour in the night Mrs. Turner was despatched to
bring this man to the earl's house. When he arrived, he found the
countess in a state of violent agitation. "Weston," she said, "was
taken; he should likely be seized immediately, and they should all be
hanged." She went into an inner room, where Franklin heard her
conversing with her husband. On her return she again urged Franklin
to be silent, and made him swear not to reveal any thing. "The
lords," she told him, "if they examine you, will put you in the hope
of a pardon upon confession: but believe them not; for, when they
have got out of you what they want, we shall all be hanged." "Nay,
madam," said Mrs. Turner, who was in the room, "I will not be
hanged for you both." That same night, or next morning, the earl
and countess, with Mrs. Turner, were arrested, and committed to
prison.</p>

<p>Weston was first tried. At first, by the direction of Serjeant Yelverton,
"an obliged servant of the house of Howard," he stood mute,
and refused to plead; but, after a few days, the terror of being pressed
to death overcame his resolution, and he pleaded "Not guilty."
The circumstances already detailed, in which he was concerned, were
fully proved. He himself confessed that he had been the medium of
the correspondence carried on between Lord Rochester and Lady
Essex, not only in regard to the poisoning of Overbury, but during
their adulterous intercourse; and he also confessed that, after
Overbury's death he had received, as a reward, one hundred and
eighty pounds from the countess, by the hands of Mrs. Turner. He
was convicted, and executed at Tyburn. At the time of his execution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Sir John Holles and Sir John Wentworth, friends of the Earl of
Somerset, went to Tyburn, and urged Weston to deny what he had
before confessed; but he refused to do so: and these gentlemen
were afterwards prosecuted in the Star-Chamber for traducing the
king's justice in these proceedings.</p>

<p>The next trial was that of Mrs. Turner. It excited intense interest,
as it involved, besides the murder of Overbury, the circumstances
of Lady Essex's connexion with Rochester. Some letters
from the countess to Mrs. Turner, and Forman the conjuror, were
read, and are preserved in the record of the proceedings. To Mrs.
Turner, (whom she addresses "Sweet Turner,") after complaining of
her misery in her husband's society, and giving vent to her passion
for Rochester, she says, "As you have taken pains all this while for
me, so now do all you can, for I was never so unhappy as now; for I
am not able to endure the miseries that are coming upon me, but I
cannot be happy so long as this man liveth: therefore, <em>pray for me</em>,(!)
for I have need, and I should be better if I had your company to
ease my mind. Let <em>him</em> know this ill news" (her husband's insisting
on cohabiting with her); if I can get this done, you shall
have as much money as you can demand: this is fair-play. Your
sister, <span class="smcap">Frances Essex</span>." In a letter to Forman, she says, "Sweet
father,&mdash;I must still crave your love, although I hope I have it, and
shall deserve it better hereafter. Keep the lord [Rochester] still
to me, for that I desire; and be careful you name me not to anybody,
for we have so many spies that you must use all your wits,&mdash;and
all little enough, for the world is against me, and the heavens
favour me not. Only happy in your love, I hope you will do me
good; and, if I be ungrateful, let all mischief come unto me. My
lord is lusty and merry, and drinketh with his men; and all the content
he gives me is to abuse me, and use me as doggedly as before.
I think I shall never be happy in this world, because he hinders my
good; and will ever, I think so. Remember, I beg, for God's sake,
and get me out from this vile place. Your affectionate loving daughter,
<span class="smcap">Frances Essex</span>." Some of the magical implements made use
of by these wretches, such as images, pictures, &amp;c. were exhibited
in court. "At the showing of these," says the account in the <em>State
Trials</em>, "there was heard a crack from the scaffolds, which caused
great fear, tumult, and confusion among the spectators, and throughout
the hall; every one fearing hurt, as if the devil had been present,
and grown angry to have his workmanship showed by such as were
not his scholars. There was also a note showed in the court made by
Dr. Forman, and written on parchment, signifying what ladies loved
what lords in court; but the Lord Chief Justice would not suffer it to
be read openly in court." The scandal of the day was, that Coke suppressed
the note because he found his own wife's name at the beginning
of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Turner's share in the death of Overbury was amply proved;
and Coke pronounced sentence upon her, telling her that she had
been guilty of the seven deadly sins, among which he enumerated
witchcraft and popery. "Upon the Wednesday following," says the
account of the trial, "she was brought from the sheriff's in a coach
to Newgate, and was there put into a cart; and, <em>casting money often
among the people as she went</em>, she was carried to Tyburn, where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
was executed, and whither many men and women of fashion came in
coaches to see her die; to whom she made a speech, desiring them
not to rejoice at her fall, but to take example by her. She exhorted
them to serve God, and abandon pride and all other sins; related her
breeding with the Countess of Somerset, having had no other means
to maintain her and her children but what came from the countess;
and said further, that, when her hand was once in the business, she
knew the revealing it would be her overthrow. The which, with
other like speeches, and great penitency there showed, moved the
spectators to great pity and grief for her."</p>

<p>Immediately after Mrs. Turner's execution, Sir Jervis Elwes, the
lieutenant of the Tower, was brought to trial. He was convicted
upon the evidence of the correspondence which he had held with the
Earl and Countess of Somerset, and also with the Earl of Northampton,
the countess's uncle; from which it appeared that that nobleman
had been deeply implicated in Overbury's murder. By the letters
read on this and some of the other trials it was shown that Northampton
was not only aware of Somerset's adulterous intercourse with his niece,
but had aided them in carrying it on; that he had been a principal promoter
of the scandalous divorce, and the equally scandalous marriage
which followed it; and that he was not only privy to the murder, but
actively instrumental in the steps taken to conceal the crime. He
was, however, freed by his death the preceding year from the earthly
retribution which would now have overtaken him. In the course
of this trial the name of Sir Thomas Monson, the chief falconer, was
also implicated; it having appeared that through his recommendation
Weston had been employed as Overbury's keeper, and that he was
at least aware of the crime. One of the principal pieces of evidence
was the voluntary confession of Franklin the apothecary, who had
been employed to provide the poisons. This man, among many other
things, said, "Mrs. Turner came to me from the countess, and wished
me from her to get the strongest poison I could for Sir Thomas
Overbury. Accordingly I bought seven, viz. aquafortis, white
arsenic, mercury, powder of diamonds, lapis costitus (lunar caustic),
great spiders, and cantharides: all these were given to Sir Thomas
Overbury at several times." He declared also, that the lieutenant
knew of these poisons: "for that appeared," he said, "by, many
letters which he writ to the Countess of Essex, which I saw, and
thereby knew that he knew of this matter."&mdash;"For these poisons," he
further said, "the countess sent me rewards. She sent many times
gold by Mrs. Turner. She afterwards wrote unto me to buy more
poisons. I went unto her, and told her I was weary of it; and I besought
her upon my knees that she would use me no more in these
matters: but she importuned me, bade me go, and enticed me with
fair speeches and rewards; so she overcame me, and did bewitch
me." The cause of the poisoning, he said, as the countess told
him, was because Sir Thomas Overbury would pry so far into their
suit (the divorce) as he would put them down. He added, that, on
the marriage-day of the countess with Somerset, (which was after
Overbury's death,) she sent him twenty pounds by Mrs. Turner, and
he was to have been paid by the countess two hundred pounds per
annum during his life. The Lord Chief Justice, when he produced
Franklin's confession upon this trial, prefaced his reading of it by informing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the court that this poor man, not knowing Sir Jervis should
come to his trial, had come to him that morning at five o'clock, and
told him that he was much troubled in his conscience, and could not
rest until he had made his confession: "and it is such a one," added
the Chief Justice, "as the eye of England never saw, nor the ear
of Christendom ever heard." Sir Jervis, who had defended himself
strenuously against the other articles of evidence, was struck dumb
by this unexpected disclosure. He was found guilty, condemned, and
executed, after having at the place of execution made a full confession
of his guilt.</p>

<p>Franklin was then tried, convicted, and executed, on his own confession
alone, to which, as it was entirely voluntary, he seems really
to have been prompted by remorse. In passing sentence upon him,
the Lord Chief Justice said, that, "knowing as much as he knew, if
this had not been found out, neither the court, city, nor any particular
family, had escaped the malice of this wicked cruelty."</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Monson was next arraigned, and strongly exhorted by
the crown lawyers to confess his crime; one of them (Hyde) declaring
him to be "as guilty as the guiltiest." The trial, however,
was brought to a strange and abrupt conclusion. In the middle of
the preliminary proceedings the culprit was suddenly carried off from
the bar by a party of yeomen of his majesty's guard, and taken to the
Tower, from whence he was soon afterwards liberated without further
trial. This singular interference is ascribed to some mysterious expressions
dropped by the Lord Chief Justice. "But the Lord Chief
Justice Coke," says Sir Anthony Weldon, "in his rhetorical flourishes
at Monson's arraignment, vented some expressions as if he could discover
more than the death of a private person; intimating, though not
plainly, that Overbury's untimely remove had in it something of retaliation,
as if he had been guilty of the same crime towards Prince
Henry; blessing himself with admiration at the horror of such actions.
In which he flew so high a pitch that he was taken down by
a court lure; Sir Thomas Monson's trial laid aside, and he soon after
set at liberty; and the Lord Chief Justice's wings were clipt for it ever
after." There can be no doubt that the conduct of Coke on these
trials was used as a handle against him by his rival and enemy, Bacon,
to deprive him of the royal favour; and, that the manner in which
his language on the above and other occasions was represented (or
misrepresented) to the king, was one cause, at least, of his removal
from his office a few months afterwards. But this was not the only
mystery connected with this matter.</p>

<p>All these trials took place in close succession between the 19th of
October and the 4th of December 1615; but the principal criminals
were not tried till May following. During this interval the earl and
countess were frequently examined, and many efforts were made to
bring them to confession. On the 24th of May the countess was
arraigned before a commission of the peers. A graphic account of
her demeanour is given in the <em>State Trials</em>. The Clerk of the Crown
addressed her:</p>

<p>"'Frances, Countess of Somerset, hold up thy hand!'</p>

<p>"She did so, and held it till Mr. Lieutenant told her she might put
it down; and then he read the indictment. The Countess of Somerset,
all the while the indictment was reading, stood, looking pale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
trembled, and shed some tears; and at the first naming of Weston in
the indictment, put her fan before her face, and there held it half
covered till the indictment was read.</p>

<p>"<em>Clerk.</em>&mdash;'Frances, Countess of Somerset, what sayest thou? Art
thou guilty of this felony and murder, or not guilty?'</p>

<p>"The Lady Somerset, making an obeisance to the Lord High
Steward, answered, '<em>Guilty</em>,' with a low voice, but wonderful fearful."</p>

<p>After the proceedings consequent on this confession, she was asked
in the usual form what she could say for herself why judgment of
death should not be pronounced against her. Her answer was,</p>

<p>"I can much aggravate, but nothing extenuate, my fault. I desire
mercy, and that the lords will intercede for me with the king."</p>

<p>"This," says the account, "she spake humbly, fearfully, and so
low, that the Lord Steward could not hear it; but Mr. Attorney repeated
it."</p>

<p>The Lord High Steward then sentenced her to the punishment of
the law.</p>

<p>The earl's trial took place on the following day. He refused to
follow his wife's example, and pleaded Not guilty. The most remarkable
feature of this trial is the correspondence between Somerset
and his victim. The following passages are striking.</p>

<p>In Overbury's first letter to Somerset, after his imprisonment, he
said,</p>

<p>"Is this the fruit of my care and love to you? Be these the
fruits of common secrets, common dangers? As a man, you cannot
suffer me to lie in this misery; yet your behaviour betrays you. All
I entreat of you is, that you will free me from this place, and that
we may part friends. Drive me not to extremities, lest I should say
something that you and I both repent. And I pray God that you
may not repent the omission of this my counsel in this place whence
I now write this letter."</p>

<p>Overbury afterwards writes,</p>

<p>"This comes under seal, and therefore I shall be bold. You told
my brother Ledcate that my unreverend style might make you neglect
me. With what face could you do this, who know you owe
me for all the fortune, wit, and understanding that you have."</p>

<p>"Yet this shall not long serve your turn; for you and I, ere it be
long, will come to a public trial of another nature,&mdash;I upon the rack,
and you at your ease, and yet I must say nothing! When I heard
(notwithstanding my misery) how you went to your woman, curled
your hair, and in the mean time send me nineteen projects how I
should cast about for my liberty, and give me a long account of the
pains you have taken, and then go out of town! I wonder to see
how much you should neglect him to whom such secrets of all kinds
have passed."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Well, all this vacation I have written the story between you and
me; how I have lost my friends for your sake; what hazard I have
run; what secrets have passed betwixt us; how, after you had won
that woman by my letters, you then concealed all your after proceedings
from me; and how upon this there came many breaches between
us; of the vow you made to be even with me, and sending for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
me twice that day that I was caught in the trap, persuading me that
it was a plot of mine enemies to send me beyond sea, and urging me
not to accept it, assuring me to free me from any long trouble. On
Tuesday I made an end of this, and on Friday sent it to a friend of
mine under eight seals; and if you persist still to use me thus, assure
yourself it shall be published. Whether I live or die, your shame
shall never die, but ever remain to the world, to make you the most
odious man living."</p>

<p>Overbury is aware that he has been betrayed and entrapped, and
is left by his treacherous patron to languish in a dungeon. He addresses
him in the bitterest and most indignant language, and threatens
him with a desperate and fatal revenge. He remembers, too,
the threat which had been applied to himself; knows himself to be
in the power of the man who used it; feels himself to be dying by
inches, of maladies which the most rigorous confinement could not
have produced; and yet it never enters his mind that his unscrupulous
enemy may have determined, by his death, to get rid of him and
his dangerous secrets!</p>

<p>The evidence of Overbury's father is affecting. "After my son
was committed," he said, "I heard that he was very sick. I went to
the court and delivered a petition to the king, the effect whereof was,
that, in respect of my son's sickness, some physicians might have access
unto him. The king answered, that his own physician should
go to him; and then instantly sent him word by Sir W. Button that
his physician should presently go. Upon this, I only addressed myself
to my Lord of Somerset, and none else, who said my son should
be presently delivered, but dissuaded me from presenting any more
petitions to the king; which notwithstanding, I (seeing his freedom
still delayed) did deliver a petition to the king to that purpose, who
said I should have present answer. And my Lord of Somerset told
me he should be suddenly relieved; but with this, that neither I nor
my wife must press to see him, because that might protract his delivery,
nor deliver any more petitions to the king, because that might
stir his enemies up against him; and then," added the poor old man,
"he wrote a letter to my wife, to dissuade her from any longer stay
in London."</p>

<p>This letter was, "Mrs. Overbury,&mdash;Your stay here in town can nothing
avail your son's delivery; therefore I would advise you to retire
into the country, and doubt not before your coming home you
shall hear he is a free man."</p>

<p>Thus did this monster amuse the unhappy parents with delusive
hopes till all was over; and he then wrote to the aged father the following
unparalleled letter:</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;Your son's love to me got him the malice of many, and
they cast those knots on his fortune that have cost him his life; so,
in a kind, there is none guilty of his death but I; and you can have
no more cause to commiserate the death of a son, than I of a friend.
But, though he be dead, you shall find me as ready as ever I was to
do all the courtesies that I possibly can to you and your wife, or your
children. In the mean time I desire pardon from you and your wife
for your lost son, though I esteem my loss the greater. And for his
brother that is in France, I desire his return, that he may succeed
his brother in my love."</p>

<p>Somerset defended himself stoutly. His desperate situation seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
to have sharpened his faculties. He cross-examined the witnesses
with much acuteness and presence of mind, made ingenious objections
to their testimony, and laboured to explain away the facts which
could not be denied. From eight in the morning till seven at night
he exerted himself with an energy worthy of a better cause; but in
vain. He was found guilty by the unanimous voice of his judges.
He then desired a death according to his degree; but this was denied
him, and he received the usual sentence of the law.</p>

<p>Thus were these great criminals brought to justice; and they received,
it may be supposed, the punishment of their crimes. No:
they were pardoned by the king,&mdash;nay more, received especial marks
of royal favour! They were imprisoned in the Tower till January
1621, when the king, by an order in council, granted them the liberty
of retiring to a country-house. "Whereas his Majesty is graciously
pleased," thus ran the order, "to enlarge and set at liberty the Earl
of Somerset and his lady, now prisoners in the Tower of London, and
that nevertheless it is thought fit that both the said earl and his lady
be confined to some convenient place; it is therefore, according to his
majesty's gracious pleasure and command, ordered that the Earl of
Somerset and his lady do repair either to Greys or Cowsham, the Lord
Wallingford's houses in the county of Oxon, and remain confined to
one or other of the said houses, and within three miles' compass of
either of the same, until further order be given by his majesty." In
1624, they both obtained full pardons; the lady, on the ground that
"the process and judgment against her were not as of a principal,
but as of an accessory before the fact;" and the earl, merely on the
ground of the king's regard for his family. Nor was this all: his
majesty granted the earl an income of four thousand pounds a-year
out of his forfeited estate; and, what was still worse, in order to save
this minion from disgrace, committed a gross outrage on the order of
knighthood to which he belonged. "The king," says Camden, "ordered
that the arms of the Earl of Somerset, notwithstanding his
being condemned of felony, should not be removed out of the chapel
at Windsor, and that felony should not be reckoned amongst the disgraces
for those who were to be excluded from the order of St.
George; which was without precedent." Without precedent indeed!</p>

<p>Remembering the king's solemn vow when, kneeling in the midst
of the judges whom he had summoned into his presence, he exclaimed,
"If you shall spare any guilty of this crime, God's curse light on
you and your posterity; and, if <em>I</em> spare any that are guilty, God's
curse light on me and my posterity for ever!" how are we to account
for so flagrant a violation of it? Even had he not so earnestly called
down the curse of Heaven upon his head, he was bound by the strongest
obligations of public justice not to screen from condign punishment
criminals so atrocious. Nor can we ascribe his failure in so sacred a
duty to personal regard for Somerset. His attachment to him was
long since extinguished; a newer favourite had engrossed his capricious
affection. Fear, not love, seems to have been the cause of his
forbearance.</p>

<p>Before Somerset's trial, mysterious circumstances were remarked,
both in his conduct and in that of the king. It is stated by several
historians that the earl, while in the Tower, loudly asserted that the
king durst not bring him to trial; and there is still extant a letter
from him to the king, written immediately after his condemnation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
in which he desires that his estate may be continued to him entire,
in a style rather of expostulation and demand than of humble supplication.
There is a studied obscurity in the style of this letter, as
if it darkly hinted at things meant to be understood only by him to
whom it was addressed; but its tone indicates that it was meant to
impress the king with the dread of a secret which the writer had it
in his power to reveal.</p>

<p>The king, on the other hand, showed the most extreme anxiety
about the earl's behaviour and the event of the trial. He himself
selected certain persons to examine Somerset in secret, among whom
was Bacon. They had the king's instructions to work upon the earl's
obstinate temper by every method of persuasion and terror; now to
give him hopes of the king's compassion and mercy, and now to impress
him with the certainty of conviction and punishment. Moreover,
the king ordered Bacon (then Attorney-General) to put in
writing every possible case which might arise at the trial out of
Somerset's behaviour. Bacon accordingly drew up a paper of this
sort, on which the king with his own hand made some marginal notes.
Bacon having said, "All these points of mercy and favour to Somerset
are to be understood with this limitation,&mdash;if he do not, by his contemptuous
and insolent carriage at the bar, make himself incapable
and unworthy of them," the king's remark in the margin was, "That
danger is well to be foreseen, lest he upon one part commit unpardonable
errors, and I on the other part seem to punish him in the
spirit of revenge." Why this solicitude to prevent the "danger" of
Somerset's adopting a "contemptuous and insolent carriage at the
bar?" And what were the "unpardonable errors" it might lead him
to commit? No error could be so unpardonable as the crime he had
already committed; and we are led, therefore, to the inference that
the king wished it to be understood, that though he was ready to
pardon the crime of which Somerset should be convicted, provided
he conducted himself <em>discreetly</em> on his trial, yet an error <em>on this score</em>
should be held as unpardonable.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these precautions and pains taken to bring
Somerset to a <em>safe</em> frame of mind, he appears to have been very untractable;
and the king's dread of his conduct during his trial, and
anxiety to know the result, seem to have amounted to agony. His
behaviour cannot be so well described as in the words of Sir Anthony
Weldon.</p>

<p>"And now for the last act enters Somerset himself upon the stage,
who, being told, as the manner is, by the lieutenant, that he must
provide to go next day to his trial, did absolutely refuse it, and said
they should carry him in his bed; that the king had assured him he
should not come to any trial, neither durst the king to bring him to
trial. This was in a high strain, and in a language not well understood
by George Moore, [Sir George Moore, lieutenant in the room
of Elwes,] that made Moore quiver and shake; and, however he was
accounted a wise man, yet he was near at his wit's end. Yet away
goes Moore to Greenwich, as late as it was, being twelve at night;
bounceth at the back-stairs as if mad; to whom came Jo. Loveston,
one of the grooms, out of his bed, inquiring the reason of that distemper
at so late a season. Moore tells him he must speak with the
king. Loverton replies, 'He is quiet,' which in the Scottish dialect
is, fast asleep. Moore says, 'You must wake him.' Moore was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
called in (the chamber left to the king and Moore). He tells the
king those passages, and desired to be directed by the king, for he
was gone beyond his own reason to hear such bold and undutiful expressions
from a faulty subject against a just sovereign. The king
falls into a passion of tears: 'On my soul, Moore, I wot not what to
do: thou art a wise man; help me in this great strait, and thou
shalt find thou dost it for a thankful master;' with other sad expressions.
Moore leaves the king in that passion, but assures him he
will prove the utmost of his wit to serve his majesty. Sir George
Moore returns to Somerset about three o'clock next morning of that
day he was to come to trial, enters Somerset's chamber, tells him he
had been with the king, found him a most affectionate master unto
him, and full of grace in his intentions towards him. 'But,' said he,
'to satisfy justice you must appear, although you return instantly again
without any further procedure; only you shall know your enemies
and their malice, though they shall have no power over you.' With
this trick of wit he allayed his fury, and got him quietly, about eight
in the morning, to the Hall; yet feared his former bold language
might revert again, and, being brought by this trick into the toil,
might have more enraged him to fly out into some strange discovery,
that he had two servants placed on each side of him, with a cloak on
their arms, giving them a peremptory order that if Somerset did any
way fly out on the king, they should instantly hoodwink him with
that cloak, take him violently from the bar, and carry him away; for
which he would secure them from any danger, and they should not
want a bountiful reward. But the earl, finding himself overreached,
recollected a better temper, and went on calmly in his trial, where
he held the company until seven at night. But who had seen the
king's restless motion all that day, sending to every boat he saw landing
at the bridge, and cursing all that came without tidings, would
have easily judged all was not right, and that there had been some
grounds for his fear of Somerset's boldness. But at last one bringing
him word he was condemned, and the passages, all was quiet."</p>

<p>The reader will remember that the abrupt termination of the proceedings
against Sir Thomas Monson, who was carried off from the
bar by a party of yeomen of the guard, was caused by the Lord Chief
Justice's having made some indiscreet allusion to suspicions regarding
the death of Prince Henry, the king's eldest son, which had taken
place in 1612, about four years before the time of these trials.</p>

<p>This young prince at a very early age displayed talents and virtues
which endeared him to the nation. The accounts of his short life are
pleasing and interesting. He was thus described when he was twelve
years old, in a letter from the French ambassador. "None of his
pleasures savour in the least of a child. He is a particular lover of
horses, and what belongs to them; but is not fond of hunting; and,
when he does engage in it, it is rather for the pleasure of galloping
than for any which the dogs give him. He is fond of playing at tennis,
and at another Scotch diversion very like mall;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but always with
persons older than himself, as if he despised those of his own age.
He studies two hours in the day, and employs the rest of his time in
tossing the pike, or leaping, or shooting with the bow, or throwing
the bar, or vaulting, or some other exercise of that kind; and he is
never idle. He is very kind to his dependents, supports their interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
against all persons whatsoever, and urges all that he undertakes
for them or others with such zeal as ensures it success; for, besides
his exerting his whole strength to compass what he desires, he is already
feared by those who have the management of affairs, and especially
by the Earl of Salisbury, who appears to be greatly apprehensive
of the prince's ascendency; as the prince, on the other hand,
shows little esteem for his lordship." This high-spirited and magnanimous
boy could not fail to be aware of the faults and vices of his
father's character. He entertained great admiration for Sir Walter
Raleigh; was often heard to exclaim, "No king but my father
would keep such a bird in a cage;" and his aversion to the Earl of
Salisbury was understood to have arisen from that nobleman's share
in Raleigh's ruin.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> His strong sense of religion rendered his father's
habit of profane swearing repulsive to him. "Once," we are told
by Coke, "when the prince was hunting the stag, it chanced the
stag, being spent, crossed the road where a butcher and his dog were
travelling. The dog killed the stag, which was so great that the
butcher could not carry him off. When the huntsman and the company
came up, they fell at odds with the butcher, and endeavoured to
incense the prince against him; to whom the prince soberly replied,
'What! if the butcher's dog killed the stag, how could the butcher
help it?' They replied, if his father had been served so, he would
have sworn as no man could have endured it. 'Away!' replied the
prince, 'all the pleasure in the world is not worth an oath.'"</p>

<p>A young prince, who, at twelve years old, was "feared by those
who had the management of affairs," must, when he grew up, have
been a formidable object to a worthless minion like Carr. He disliked
this man from the first; and his aversion grew into a rooted
hatred. When Carr was made Viscount Rochester, Henry, then
about fourteen, as we are told by Osborn, "contemned so far his
father's election of Rochester, that he was reported either to have
struck him on the back with his racket, or very hardly forborne it."
The prince continued to express on all occasions an abhorrence of
favourites, and an utter contempt of Carr; and made no secret of his
resolution to humble both him and the family into which he was allied
if ever he came to the throne.</p>

<p>Carr, then, must necessarily have feared and hated the prince; and
it is hardly to be supposed that such feelings would remain passive in
a mind like his. Henry did not enjoy his father's favour. The king's
"genius was rebuked" in the presence of a son so much his superior
in every moral and intellectual quality; and he was jealous of
the esteem and admiration in which the youth was held by the nation.
"The vivacity, spirit, and activity of the prince," says Dr.
Birch, "soon gave umbrage to his father's court, which grew extremely
jealous of him."&mdash;"The king," says Osborn, "though he
would not deny any thing the prince plainly desired, yet it appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
rather the result of fear and outward compliance than love or natural
affection; being harder drawn to confer an honour or pardon, in cases
of desert, upon a retainer of the prince, than a stranger." The
prince himself, in a letter written within a few weeks of his death, excused
himself from applying on behalf of a friend, for some piece of
court favour, "because, as matters now go here, I will deal in no
businesses of importance for some respects." At this time Carr was
in the height of his power; and this position of the prince at his
father's court must be ascribed in no small degree to the influence of
the favourite.</p>

<p>Prince Henry died on the 6th of November 1612, (at the age of
eighteen,) of an illness under which he had laboured for two or
three weeks. The symptoms (as detailed by Dr. Birch in his Life
of the prince) were of the most violent kind; dreadful affections
of the stomach and bowels, excessive thirst, burning heat, blackness
of the tongue, convulsions, and delirium. The physicians "could
not tell what to make of the distemper," were confounded by "the
strangeness of the disease," and differed in their opinions as to its
treatment. The day after the prince's death his body was opened
by order of the king; and the report of the physicians who examined
it does not indicate the operation of poison. They say, in
particular, "his stomach was without any manner of fault or imperfection."</p>

<p>The grief of the nation pervaded all ranks, and almost all parties.
The king himself, however, manifested the utmost insensibility.
Only three days after the prince's death, Carr (then Lord Rochester)
wrote, by the king's orders, to the English ambassador at Paris, directing
him to resume the marriage treaty, which had been begun
for Prince Henry, in the name of his brother Charles. After a very
short interval, all persons were prohibited from appearing in mourning
before the king; and orders were given that the preparations
for the Christmas festivities should proceed without interruption.
The Earl of Dorset, in a letter written at this time to the English
ambassador in France, uses these expressions: "That our rising sun
is set ere scarcely he had shone, and that with him all our glory
lies buried, you know and do lament as well as we; <em>and better than
some do, and more truly</em>, or else you are not a man, and sensible of
this kingdom's loss."</p>

<p>Suspicions that the young prince had come foully by his death became
prevalent immediately after that event. They were by no means
of that vague and unmeaning kind which the untimely end of an illustrious
person is apt to occasion among the vulgar. "The queen,"
says Dr. Welwood, "to her dying day could never be dissuaded from
the opinion that her beloved son had foul play done him." Bishop
Burnet, in his History of his own time, says, that Charles the First declared
that the prince, his brother, had been poisoned by the means of
the Viscount Rochester, afterwards Earl of Somerset. And contemporary
writers afford innumerable proofs of this opinion having been
entertained by persons engaged in public affairs, and conversant with
the transactions of the time.</p>

<p>The opinions of modern writers, as may be supposed, are divided
on a question so dark and mysterious. "Violent reports were propagated,"
says Hume, "as if Henry had been carried off by poison; but
the physicians, on opening his body, found no symptoms to confirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
such an opinion. The bold and criminal malignity of men's tongues
and pens spared not even the king on the occasion; but that prince's
character seems rather to have failed in the extreme of facility and
humanity, than in that of cruelty and violence." Hume's facts, it
is notorious, often assume the colouring of his political feelings; of
which a pretty strong instance occurs in this very case of Sir Thomas
Overbury, whose imprisonment in the Tower, says this historian,
"James intended as <em>a slight punishment for his disobedience</em>" in refusing
to go as ambassador to Russia. James ordered Overbury to be
most rigorously confined, and even sent a gentleman to the Tower
for having simply exchanged a word with the prisoner. Nay, more:
James knew all along that Overbury was languishing in his dungeon;
having received, and disregarded, repeated petitions from his afflicted
father for his release. And this, according to Hume, was intended by
James as a slight punishment for what was, in truth, no offence.</p>

<p>In the preface, by Lord Holland, to Fox's History of the early part
of the reign of James the Second, we find the opinion of that illustrious
statesman upon the subject. Lord Holland, speaking of Mr.
Fox's historical researches, and his correspondence with the Earl of
Lauderdale and others of his friends respecting them, says: "Even
while his undertaking was yet fresh, in the course of an inquiry into
some matters relating to the trial of Somerset, in King James the
First's reign, he says to his correspondent, 'But what is all this, you
will say, to my history? Certainly nothing; but one historical inquiry
leads to another: and I recollect that the impression upon my
mind was, that there was more reason than is generally allowed for
suspecting that Prince Henry was poisoned by Somerset, and that
the king knew of it after the fact. This is not, to be sure, to my present
purpose; but I have thought of prefixing to my work, if ever it
should be finished, a disquisition upon Hume's history of the Stuarts;
and in no part of it would his partiality appear stronger than in
James the First.'"</p>

<p>For ourselves, we shall not pretend to penetrate a mystery which
is now, perhaps, for ever inscrutable. But the events which we have
related form an impressive and instructive page of the great book of
human life.</p>

<p>The guilty pair, who were the chief actors in these tragic scenes,
though they escaped the death which they had merited, did not escape,
even in life, the retribution of their crimes. They suffered "a living
death." For many years they resided together, in the house allotted
to them as their place of banishment, detested by the world and
by each other. The unceasing torments of an evil conscience were
embittered by mutual hatred so rancorous and implacable, that they
passed year after year in the same dwelling without the interchange
of a single word. Their doom may be likened to that so fearfully described
in the tale of the Caliph Vathek. It seemed as if their
punishment was begun ere yet they had tasted of death. The everlasting
fire was already burning in their hearts; hope, the last and
most precious of Heaven's blessings, had forsaken them for ever;
and they read in each other's eyes nothing but rage, aversion, and
despair. So they lived, in seclusion and solitude, till their existence
was forgotten; and, of those who have commemorated their crimes,
hardly any one has cared to record the periods when, one after the
other, they dropped into eternity.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="AN_EXCELLENT_OFFER" id="AN_EXCELLENT_OFFER"></a>AN EXCELLENT OFFER.</h2>

<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY MARMADUKE BLAKE.</p>


<p>"It's an excellent offer&mdash;so plain and handsome!"</p>

<p>The above contradictory description was applied by Mrs. Gibbs to the
contents of a letter which a few hours previously, had been received
by her husband, Mr. John Gibbs, of Adelaide Crescent, Camberwell.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs were rather elderly: a stranger would have
taken them to be brother and sister; for, having lived together during
the greater part of a long life, not only had their habits and modes
of thought become congenial, but even the expression of their respective
features had assumed a strong resemblance.</p>

<p>On the evening in which it is our purpose to introduce the reader
to their acquaintance, Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs occupied the precise position
which they had at the same hour occupied evening after evening
for the preceding forty years; that is, Mrs. Gibbs was by the
side of the table with her "work," and Mr. Gibbs sate with his feet
upon the fender, an open book by his side, on which his spectacles
were deposited, while his body was assuming a backward inclination,
which was occasionally checked by a sudden bobbing forward of the
head, accompanied by a pulmonary effort of a most profound description.</p>

<p>"A little more, and I should have been asleep," said Mr. Gibbs;
and, as the remark had escaped from the lips of that gentleman once
every evening during nearly half a century, it did not seem to Mrs.
Gibbs to call for any particular reply.</p>

<p>"I was speaking, my dear," said she, "of Mr. Paine's offer."</p>

<p>"And I," responded Mr. Gibbs, "was thinking upon the very same
subject at the moment when you spoke; I was thinking that we must
keep our eyes open to the advantages which are now presented."</p>

<p>Mr. Gibbs took a glass of wine, resumed his horizontal position, and
seemed disposed to nod.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear,&mdash;now do rouse up,&mdash;if we are to accept Mr. Paine
as a son-in-law, what will young Langton say to us?"</p>

<p>"I hope," said Mr. Gibbs, rubbing his eyes and yawning most uncomfortably,&mdash;"I
hope Mr. Langton doesn't dream&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear," interrupted the lady, "you must allow, we <em>have</em>
given him a little encouragement."</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;not at all," was the reply; "nothing could be further
from my intention: if indeed he had such an idea as you seem to
intimate, I'm sure it has never been encouraged by me; he may
have fancied otherwise, but anything of the sort on my part was mere
manner, I assure you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibbs seemed satisfied, and the conversation on Mr. Paine's
offer was resumed.</p>

<p>"He is so very respectable," said Mr. Gibbs, "and at a very suitable
age for Caroline; two giddy people together would never do
any good: I don't think much good ever comes of early marriages."</p>

<p>"We were neither of us of age when we married," interposed
Mrs. Gibbs: "I hope you consider that case to have been an exception."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gibbs was still dozy, and he nodded his head just at the right
moment. The lady continued.</p>

<p>"If I were asked to <em>choose</em> a husband for my daughter, I shouldn't
hesitate to give her Paine."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," replied Gibbs, who misunderstood his wife; "it
would be entirely for her own good."</p>

<p>"He is a very pleasant man," ruminated Mrs. Gibbs.</p>

<p>"He has a thorough knowledge of the world, a great deal of philosophy,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A nice house in the Regent's Park."</p>

<p>We need not further pursue the interesting dialogue; suffice it to
say that it terminated in a decision favourable to Mr. Paine, and a
comfortable belief that if Mr. Charles Langton should go out of his
mind, it would be entirely his own fault, as any encouragement which
he might fancy to have been given, was only to be attributed to Mr.
Gibbs's "manner."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs were "early people;" the clock struck ten,
the housemaid and cook were heard ascending to their places of repose.
Mrs. Gibbs followed, while her husband commenced, according
to nightly custom, a perambulation in the dark, in order to see that
everything was right; and having descended into the kitchen, and
peeped into the cellar, and put his foot into a dish of water and red
wafers set as a black-beetle trap, and knocked his forehead against a
half-open door, he felt, as he said, satisfied in his mind, and could go
to sleep in the most comfortable manner.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful night!" said the gentleman as he placed the
extinguisher on his candle and the bright light of the moon entered
his dressing-room. He manifested, however, no romantic desire to
sit and watch her silent progress, so in a short time her beams were
falling on the unconscious features of Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs.</p>

<p>The night was beautiful indeed,&mdash;so beautiful that we can only
hope to bring it to the mind's eye of our matter-of-fact friends by
stating that it was one of those evenings when the moon attains a
brilliancy so extraordinary, that "you may see to pick up a pin;"
having arrived at which point, we have been accustomed to believe
lunar brightness can no further go.</p>

<p>The number of moonlight nights which shed their influence upon
us during a passing year is of very small amount; and yet, when we
suffer memory to look through "the waves of time," how much of
moonlight is brought upon the mind. Day after day passes away,
and although they give birth to new events and unlooked-for changes,
yet they leave no more impression behind than we should experience
after a survey of the fragmental patterns of a kaleidoscope,&mdash;each
movement produces a variation, but there is nevertheless a general
sameness of character which is altogether destructive of a permanent
effect;&mdash;but in the lives of all men there have been moonlight "passages"
which stand alone in their recollection, and which come upon
them in after years, remembered as the periods when the heart, escaping
from the stifling struggles of daily life, assumed a freer action,&mdash;moments
in which they made resolutions which perhaps were broken,
but which nevertheless it is some credit to them only to have made.</p>

<p>By daylight we are apt to consider mankind in the mass; by moonlight
we invariably individualize,&mdash;we feel more deeply how mysteriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
we stand, lonely in the midst of countless multitudes, and we
draw more closely to our hearts those who have sought to lighten</p>

<p>Reader, when you take a retrospect of life, we will answer for
it that your fancy turns to some moonlight game with happy
schoolfellows beneath a row of ancient elms, which threw their long
cold shadows upon the greensward by the side of a village church.
Let your fancy wander on, there is moonlight still: you roam, perchance,
near the same church, and a gentle maiden is by your side;
but you do not choose the elm-walk now, because the "school-boys"
divert themselves thereon, and you prefer a semi-solitary stroll. Onward
still: you are mixing in the bustle and heat of life; and there
are moonlight hours when the thought of your vain career comes
upon your mind, and you form in your heart new resolves, and pant
with higher aspirations. Onward once more: and the scene is drawing
to a close, the mist is on your sight, and memory wanders o'er a
field of graves; and now how often do you lift your aching eyes to
the silent and trembling stars, and suffer fancies to dwell upon your
mind, that perchance from those orbs the spirits of the dead may be
permitted to look down!</p>

<p>We only intended to venture a few words upon this subject, but we
are afraid that we have written a "discourse."</p>

<p>There is a range of hill running from Westerham to Sevenoaks, the
neighbourhood of which abounds with quiet scenery of surpassing
beauty; and during the period in which Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs's dialogue
took place, the young lady to whom it referred was indulging
in a pleasant stroll in the garden of a cottage which stood in one of
the little valleys at the foot of this range, and in which dwelt the
parents of the young gentleman who was the companion of her walk,
and who was the identical person whom Mr. Gibbs so strenuously
stated to have received no "encouragement" whatever.</p>

<p>They wandered round a lawn encircled by a shrubbery path, which
was glittering in the silver light: they were very silent, but they felt
all that youth can feel, although an occasional exclamation of "How
beautiful this is!" was all that mutually escaped their lips. A midsummer
night and a garden-path are capable of imparting much power
to the most delicate young ladies; and instances are by no means
rare of some who would have shrunk from the prospect of an excursion
extending to a mile from home, who will nevertheless stroll unrepiningly
in company with a cousin or a friend two or three hundred
times round a gravel-walk!</p>

<p>There was a happy family within doors,&mdash;brothers and sisters,&mdash;the
light from the cottage-windows shining on the shrubs in front,
and the merry laugh sounding from within: occasionally they were
interrupted in their stroll, and messages were sent to know "whether
they were coming in,&mdash;and that the grass was wet, and the night-air
dangerous, and Miss Gibbs very delicate," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; to which messages
replies were given that "they were <em>not</em> walking on the grass,
and that the air was exceedingly mild, and that Miss Gibbs had a
headache, and found herself better out of doors;" and then they were
told that it was past ten o'clock,&mdash;and they promised to come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
directly; and Mr. Langton only asked Caroline to take one turn more,
and during that time he took Miss Gibbs's arm; and then he must
walk once more round, and "this should positively be the last;" and
so they took another turn, and this time his arm gently encircled her
waist; and as they came in, there was a little hesitation while they
were scraping their feet, and Caroline upon entering looked a little
confused, and Mr. Langton seemed remarkably buoyant, and he rattled
on for an hour or two, till his mother declared that there was
"no getting him to bed;" and after Caroline and his mother and sisters
had retired, he entered into an elaborate speech to his father
concerning his prospects in life, which was only discontinued upon
the discovery that his respectable parent had been asleep for upwards
of an hour.</p>

<p>The reader who compares the stern reality of our opening scene
with the poetic character of that by which it was succeeded, will
have little difficulty in anticipating the result: the first disclosed the
decision upon a plan which it had long been the chief object of a
worldly man to effect; the latter was the idle dream of a boy and
girl who knew nothing of the world, and still less of themselves.</p>

<p>On the morning subsequent to his moonlight walk, cool reflection
had operated on the mind of Mr. Langton so far as to reduce the
ardour with which he desired to communicate to his father his design
of immediately entering into some active pursuit, with the view of
sharing with an amiable partner an income which he was quite sure he
could not fail to realize, but which as yet existed only in his own
imagination. Nevertheless, although the daylight had thus produced
its usual effect, and had given a matter-of-fact turn to his thoughts, he
felt that he really did love Caroline, although it might be prudent to
wait some few years before he made a formal declaration to that effect.
Like most other young persons, he imagined that it was the
easiest thing in the world to live on with unshaken affection, however
distant might be the realization of his hopes: he was little aware of
the numberless and apparently trivial influences which, during a period
of prolonged separation or suspense, tend effectually to give a new
colour to the views of those who have thus drawn upon futurity.</p>

<p>As he seated himself at the breakfast-table, he received from Caroline,
in return for one of those</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse center">"Looks and signs</div>
<div class="verse">We see and feel, but none defines,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>a very kind glance, which assured him that he was the object of kind
thoughts: he fancied that Fate had already twined the wreath that
was to bring their happy fortune within one bright round,&mdash;that their
love would be sanctified by the very difficulties with which he might
have to contend before he could make her his wife,&mdash;that, with her
as the reward of his exertions, he could not fail to succeed, and that
to her influence alone he should proudly attribute whatever honours
he might ultimately gain:&mdash;that look across the breakfast-table, unobserved
by others, was the source from whence his imagination
found no difficulty in tracing the Nile-like current of his future
career!</p>

<p>We want to compress into one paper, events which were brought
about by the course of several years; we must therefore hurry the
reader over a few facts which perhaps he will have anticipated already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after the consultation between Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs, Caroline
received a letter from them, written in a tone of more than ordinary
affection, interweaved with some little sermon-like passages
touching the implicit obedience which children should at all times
bestow upon their parents, and enforcing the same by the observation
that those who had lived in the world nearly sixty years must of
course in that time have acquired a nice sensibility of the manner in
which to deal with the affections of the young. It concluded by requiring
her immediate return to town; it gave their best love to Mr.
and Mrs. Langton, and their compliments to Mr. Charles.</p>

<p>On Caroline's return the arrangements respecting Mr. Paine were
fully detailed. Caroline cried, and Mrs. Gibbs said it was very natural
she should dislike to leave her mother,&mdash;that she would consult
her wishes in every way,&mdash;that she lived only in the happiness of her
child, but that she must <em>insist</em> upon her acceptance of Mr. Paine:
and then Caroline's friends were entreated to come and see her as
often as possible, and they were particularly requested by Mrs. Gibbs
not to put any idle fancies into her head which might prejudice her
against the match; and one young lady of four-and-thirty, who had
once possessed some charms, and who had flirted away all her
chances, was desired to come and "cheer her up" whenever she could
find time: the said young lady having for the last five years been in
the habit of expressing a contempt for <em>very</em> young men, and an extreme
desire to become the wife of some "nice old gentleman who
kept his carriage."</p>

<p>After the detail of these circumstances, it will not be thought surprising
that at a period of seven years from the opening of our story
Caroline had long been the wife of Mr. Paine; and, having become the
mother of three children, had made every effort, although perhaps
she had not succeeded, to forget the moonlight walk in which she
had been "<em>so</em> happy" with Charles Langton.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine was a merchant. His father, who had been a warehouseman
in Friday-street, had, as is the custom of warehousemen,
amassed a considerable fortune; and, although he had not been known
to think very highly of himself while he was in indifferent circumstances,
his own estimate of his value as a man, gradually grew with
the strength of his pocket. His friends considered this a very proper
view, and towards the end of his life he became much respected.
Some time before his death he had purchased for his son a partnership
in a house of "high standing," in which that gentleman had
gradually risen from junior partner until he became the head of the
firm. He inherited along with his father's wealth a great similarity
of disposition; and his ideas of the importance of the "house," and
consequently of his own importance as the head of the firm, had become
the all-absorbing feature of his mind. Now this, although it
told with admirable effect in Broad-street, was scarcely calculated to
astonish his West-end connexions, nor was it likely to give that freedom
of manner which forms the peculiar charm of domestic life.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine, on account of his mercantile standing, had been elected
to a directorship of a prosperous insurance company; and as he was
accustomed to look in daily at the office of the establishment, where
he found himself surrounded by bowing clerks, and porters in bright
waistcoats, who never heard a whisper from his voice without raising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
their hands to their hats, he became very deeply impressed with the
idea that he really was an extraordinary person. No doubt he was
so; but it was the misfortune of Mr. Paine that he never contemplated
that "unbending of the bow" which is rather necessary to
make home happy, and consequently when he returned from town he
was cold and formal, in order to produce an impression on his servants,
similar to that which gratified him in the City; and when he
took his seat at the dinner-table there was hardly any variation from
the manner which characterised him as chairman at the weekly
meetings of the company, each remark being delivered in a style
which sounded very much like a Resolution of "the Board."</p>

<p>Men choose their acquaintances as they choose their wives, and
are very apt to select those whose qualities differ most widely from
their own. Acting upon this principle, Mr. Paine had become intimate
with a person to whom he condescended in a more than ordinary
degree.</p>

<p>This person was Mr. Hartley Fraser, an unmarried man, at about
the middle, or, as it is very pleasantly termed, the prime of life. He
was of good family and small income; which latter circumstance he
always assigned as the cause of his determination to live single, although
it was attributed by some to a habit of ease and self-indulgence
which he was now not disposed to correct. He knew and liked
everybody in the world; and his philanthropy was not thrown away,
for he was universally sought after, and in the making up of parties
was always spoken of as a very desirable man. He humoured the
foibles and flattered the caprices of his friends; the ladies liked him
because he was "so useful," and the men spoke well of him because
he never became a rival. He had always avowed his intention of remaining
unwived, since, to use his own words, he found that he could
drag on quietly enough with six or seven hundred a year as a bachelor,
and he felt no inclination to go back in the world by becoming the
proprietor of an expensive wife and a needy "establishment."</p>

<p>His manner, which, as we have already stated, was quite antithetical
to Mr. Paine's, was as easy and kind as possible; and his stiff
friend was never able to unravel the means by which, in the absence
of a cast-iron stateliness, he invariably seemed to produce a feeling of
deference in the minds of those with whom he came in contact.
Though professing poverty, he never borrowed. His appearance was
extremely good; while in conversation he rarely spoke of himself,
and, if ever he did so, it was with an air of so little reserve, that his
hearer could not help entertaining an idea that he was the most candid
person in the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine felt quite proud of his popular acquaintance; and, as
pride was the only attribute through which it was possible to gratify
or wound that gentleman's feelings, of course he entertained as much
regard for him as he could under any circumstances feel for any one.
Fraser was therefore a frequent visitor at his house, which, despite of
the governor's formality, was pleasant enough, for Caroline was always
kind and cheerful, and "the children" were never visible.</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser soon became aware that his visits were rendered more
frequent by the attraction of Caroline's society, while she could not
sometimes help acknowledging to herself that her husband's selfish
coldness was not placed in the most favourable light by a contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
with his agreeable friend. This was a dangerous discovery; but just
at the period when it might have led to serious inroads on her happiness,
an accident occurred which gave a new turn to her thoughts,
and which tended to a catastrophe as unforeseen as it was fatal.</p>

<p>At an early hour in the afternoon a servant who had charge of the
children would frequently request permission to take the eldest, a fine
boy six years of age, for a short walk. Her consideration for the
health and mental improvement of her young charge invariably induced
her to wend her way to Oxford-street, where, by a strange
coincidence, she invariably met a young gentleman in a flour-sprinkled
jacket who emerged from a neighbouring baker's, and with whom,
though they only met on these occasions, it afterwards appeared she
was "keeping company." During the period of their conversation
the child was told to "play about;" and, with that inherent love of
liberty which dwells in the human mind, the boy made a point of
availing himself of this permission by forthwith getting into all those
spots which at other times he had been taught to shun. Occasionally
a foot would become fixed between the iron gratings of an area in
such a manner that he was unable to extract it; and then he would
immediately roar as though he had been placed there by some tyrannical
nursery-maid, and a crowd would collect to sympathise with his
pangs, and at length to witness his extrication. At other times the
gutter would seem to offer irresistible attraction; and in all cases the
attentive guardian to whom he was entrusted consented not to tell her
"missus" of his delinquencies if he would promise not to say a word
about the young man from the baker's. This system was carried on
till it had nearly terminated in a serious event. The child, having on
one occasion stepped off the footway, was thrown down in attempting
to escape from a carriage that was furiously approaching: in
another instant the horses would have trampled upon him, had not a
young man who observed his frightful situation rushed, heedless of
danger, to the horses' heads, and, with the aid of the coachman, arrested
their progress. The stranger learned from the boy his name
and residence, conveyed him home, and, after giving an account of
the accident, left a card with the footman to whom he delivered the
child. About an hour afterwards the guardian angel returned in
great alarm, when she was immediately favoured with unlimited leave
of absence, and thereby enabled, literally as well as metaphorically,
to "keep company" with her interesting friend.</p>

<p>On the following morning, a paragraph, which ran as follows, decorated
the columns of the Morning Post.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, as Lady Crushmore's carriage was going down Oxford-street,
it nearly passed over a child who had fallen before the horses:
the boy was, however, rescued by a person who happened to witness
his perilous situation. We merely notice the circumstance in order
that we may have the satisfaction of recording a noble instance of
humanity on the part of Lady Crushmore, who would not suffer the
coachman to drive on until he had inquired whether the child was
hurt."</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe Caroline's feelings when she
received the account of the accident: she took the card which had
been left by the stranger, but in the excitement of the moment she
did not heed the name, and, throwing it on one side, she pressed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
terrified boy to her breast with hysteric minglings of tears and laughter.
That afternoon Mr. Paine returned in company with Fraser;
and, as he entered, he received an account of what had happened.
He was by no means moved, but went into the matter, and asked
questions in a most cool and dignified manner.</p>

<p>"Really," he said, "I think this is a case we ought not to look
over; and therefore I must move, that is, I would suggest, that the
boy should receive a very severe whipping."</p>

<p>The motion, not being seconded, fell to the ground, and Mr. Paine
continued,</p>

<p>"Have you learned the name of the person by whom he was accompanied
home?"</p>

<p>Caroline recollected the card, and, without looking at it, handed it
to her husband.</p>

<p>"Langton&mdash;Charles Langton, Raymond Buildings," ruminated Mr.
Paine; "I don't know the name."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Caroline; "Charles Langton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear; is there anything so extraordinary in the name&mdash;is
he any connexion of your family?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;that is, my father had a very old friend of the name
of Langton, who lived near Sevenoaks."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the amiable Paine, who prided himself on the sarcastic,
"Raymond Buildings are within a stone's throw of Sevenoaks."</p>

<p>Mr. Paine had not observed any great peculiarity in Caroline's
manner; but he was excessively fond of giving utterance to an occasional
sneer, which was the highest effort of his conversational power.
But with Fraser, who had been a silent spectator of the scene, the
emotion which Caroline betrayed when the card was read did not
pass unnoticed or unremembered.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine having on the subsequent day made strict inquiries as
to the respectability of the man who had saved his child, condescended
to forward a note of thanks and an invitation to dine. This
was immediately accepted, for Langton was not ignorant that the
mother of the boy was his early friend; and, although circumstances
were so sadly altered, he could not resist an opportunity of renewing
the acquaintance.</p>

<p>The dinner to which he thus had the honour of being invited, went
off rather flatly. There was a large party, principally composed of
that class of persons who get their heads muddled in wool and tallow
speculations during the day, and who attempt to become particularly
brilliant and exclusive in the evening, when unfortunately it generally
happens that, despite their best exertions,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Let them dress, let them talk, let them act as they will,</div>
<div class="verse">The scent of the city will hang round them still."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Fraser, to whom Mr. Paine always looked as the enlivener of his
otherwise cold dinners, was on this occasion unusually quiet, Langton
and Caroline were mutually embarrassed, and Mr. Paine's platitudes
grew more and more tiresome, till at length, when the dessert made
its appearance, he took an opportunity of effecting an elaborate
speech, the object of which was to impress upon his friends the sensation
which would have been created if the eldest child and only
son of Mr. Paine, of the firm of Paine, Grubb, and Jones, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the victim of any serious accident, and the gratitude which in consequence
they ought to entertain to the person by whom such an
event had been arrested.</p>

<p>"A shock so calamitous," he said, "has been averted by the intrepid
conduct of Mr. Langton; and I must therefore beg that he
will accept the cordial thanks of this meeting,&mdash;that is, of myself and
friends,&mdash;for the courage and presence of mind which he so seasonably
displayed."</p>

<p>This speech exhibited such a style of pompous foolery, that during
its delivery Fraser was tempted to glance at Caroline with peculiar
significance, which seemed to intimate a considerable degree of contempt
for her husband, and an idea that a similar feeling could not
be altogether a stranger to her bosom.</p>

<p>Langton observed all this; and although it was with little surprise,
for he knew that love is more easily alienated by pride than any other
sentiment, yet he could not help feeling the most sincere regret that
Caroline had entered upon that dangerous path, the first step of
which is the condescending to show to any man a feeling of this
nature.</p>

<p>"I have not learned to love her less," he said, when afterwards
meditating on this circumstance, "and I love her too well to see her
comfort or fame lightly lost while it may be in my power to save her.
It was always her nature to be easily led by the influence of others;
and although her pliant disposition may have linked her destiny with
one whom it is evident she can never love, yet she may still be saved
from a more fearful sacrifice. I will see her, and in the recollection of
our early friendship, as well as in the recent claim which I have acquired
upon her feelings, I will venture to speak boldly and sincerely.
In warning her of the precipice on which she stands, she must not,
however, be violently aroused to a sense of danger which perhaps she
has not yet acknowledged to herself. I must first gently win her back
to that spirit of confidence which we formerly knew, and, if I succeed
in my ultimate aim, how slight in comparison will seem the peril from
which I have saved the child, to that from which I shall have rescued
the mother!"</p>

<p>Alas! that the morality of the young, which is so strong in thought,
should be so weak in practice as it ever is. Here was another stone
added to that pavement which is said to be composed of good intentions.</p>

<p>From this time he became a frequent visitor in the Regent's Park,
and the result of this course will be best given in the description of
an interview between himself and Caroline which took place about
three months afterwards.</p>

<p>"Caroline," said he, as during a morning call, which had been
prolonged to a most unfashionable extent, he sate alone by her side,
"I find you the same kind being that you always were; it is from
that tenderness of feeling, which under happier circumstances would
have given additional value to your character, that I now dread an
inroad on your peace. You confess that you are wearied with the
cold and monotonous routine of your daily life, and that it is your
fate to be linked with one who is incapable of understanding or returning
any deep emotion of the heart; can you then wonder that I
should tremble for your peace, when I see you flattered by the attentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
of a man from whom I am afraid you have not been sufficiently
discreet to conceal the disquiet which you suffer?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed you have mistaken me," exclaimed Caroline. "I
have neither been flattered by his attention, nor have I in any way
confided in him: to you only have I spoken thus. I was wrong, very
wrong, in doing so; but you entreated me to speak without reserve,
and it is hardly kind of you now to tax me with the fault." As she
said this, the tears started to her eyes, and as Langton gazed upon
her he knew that the very confidence which had appeared so dangerous
when he imagined it to be given to another, was now unreservedly
bestowed upon himself: did he remember his indignant anticipations
of broken happiness and degraded character on the part
of Caroline, or did he apply to himself those rules which he had
deemed so necessary to be considered by another? Alas! no. He
took her hand, and said in a voice which faltered with emotion,</p>

<p>"Caroline, dear Caroline, I cannot bear to see you give way thus.
Come, come, we must not have any tears: you may be very happy
yet."</p>

<p>"No," she said, making a vain attempt to repress her sobs, "I do
not hope to be happy,&mdash;I have not deserved to be so; for I knew,
when they wished me joy on my wedding-day, that my happiness
was gone for ever. But I must not talk thus to you, Charles; I
have no right to trouble you with sorrows of my own seeking. Besides,"
she continued, smiling bitterly through her tears, "you are
about to be married to one who cannot fail to love you, and I must
claim no share in your thoughts. Believe me, I will conquer every
emotion that you desire to be repressed. I will endeavour to be all
that you would wish to see me,&mdash;indeed I will: only tell me that
you are not offended,&mdash;that you do not think less kindly of me than
you have always done,&mdash;and that you will sometimes think of her
who, while she lives, can never cease to think and pray for you."
She buried her face in her hands and wept bitterly. "Don't, don't
speak to me now," she said, as her tears flowed more quickly; and
Langton, taking her hand, felt them falling on his own. At that moment
he considered himself pre-eminently wretched; he pressed her
head upon his shoulder, bidding her be more calm, and, as he imprinted
one kiss upon her forehead,&mdash;a servant entered the room.</p>

<p>"Did you ring, sir?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Langton furiously, and the intruder disappeared. Servants
always think you ring at the very moment when you wish you
were in a wilderness!</p>

<p>The party who received Mr. Langton's impetuous negative was a
fat housemaid of extreme sensibility; and as the sensibility of housemaids
is usually concentrated upon themselves, of course, in the description
of the indignity she had received, any very delicate consideration
for the character of her mistress could not be expected to
find a place. A committee was immediately formed in the pantry,
where she related the "undelicate" conduct of that lady to her sympathising
colleagues, and several strong resolutions were immediately
carried expressive of their unqualified admiration of virtue in general,
and their particular disapprobation of the deviation from its
strict rules which had just been detailed; but as the said committee
could not perceive any particular benefit to themselves that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
likely to result from a disclosure to Mr. Paine, they determined to
let the matter drop, and merely to suffer it to exist as an occasional
topic to give intensity to those sublime denunciations of the wickedness
of their betters in which they were accustomed to indulge round
the kitchen fire, when their thoughts were glowing beneath the stimulus
of an occasional bottle of wine which had been abstracted from
the cellars of their "injured master."</p>

<p>Of course, however, it was not to be expected that the knowledge
of the circumstance should be concealed from their immediate circle
of acquaintance; and as the green-grocer wished he might drop if he
ever breathed a syllable about it, and the milkwoman thanked Heaven
that she never was a mischief-maker, of course the insulted housemaid
"didn't mind telling them," upon their promise of profound secrecy;
which was especially necessary, as, with the exception of the
servants on each side of Mr. Paine's, and the nurserymaid opposite,
not a soul knew a word about the matter.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the watchful being who had been discharged
on account of the affair in Oxford-street, was one of those
amiable characters by whom forgiveness of injuries is accounted a
duty. She had carried out this principle so far, that, although she
had been desired never to enter the house again, she would occasionally
call after dark to see her old fellow-servants, with whom she
would sometimes take a glass of ale, in order to show how completely
she had subdued those feelings of animosity which she might be expected
to entertain towards the person at whose cost it was provided.
She always seemed to take the same interest in the family
as she had formerly done, and, with a spirit of Christian charity
which did honour to her nature, she would sometimes declare "that
although they had injured <em>her</em>, yet she hoped it would never come
home to them."</p>

<p>Any concealment from a person of this disposition was of course
unnecessary; and, when she was made acquainted with the circumstance,
her horror was unlimited. "Poor Mr. Paine, who was so
much of a gentleman!&mdash;and Mrs. Paine, too, who always seemed to
love the dear children so!&mdash;who would take care of them now?&mdash;and
then <em>that</em> Mr. Langton, she always said from the first she never liked
<em>him</em>! But no," she continued, her goodness of disposition again overmastering
every other feeling, "I won't believe it,&mdash;I can't do so;
though I know, Mary, that you wouldn't tell a falsehood for the
world, and, if you couldn't speak well of anybody, would rather say
nothin' at all."</p>

<p>The reader will be surprised to learn that, although Mr. Paine's
servants had acted with such praiseworthy reserve, a letter was received
by that gentleman at the insurance office of which he was
chairman, (the seal bearing the royal arms, which had been produced
by the application of a sixpence; and the post-mark giving indications
of the existence of a place called "Goswell-street Road,") the purport
of which was as follows:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Nothin but my ankziety for your peas of mind could indews
me to writ this letter, which i am afeard will set your fealings
in a flame, &amp; cause you grate distres. i am sorry to say your confidens

<p>"Your wife is untrew&mdash;the young man who pickt up Master Eddard
when he <em>would</em> run into the rode, is one of her old bows. You may

what wickedness is.</p>

<p>"If you don't take warnin by what I have writ you will peraps be
unhappy all the rest of your days, and so I hope you will.</p>

<p class="in12">"From your sincere well-wisher,</p>
<p class="author">"J.J."</p>

<p>It is said that, for the deprivation of one sense, compensation is not
unfrequently given by an increased action which is acquired to the
remainder; and those who have seen men cut off from the enjoyment
of some long-cherished feeling at the moment when its gratification
seemed most essential to their happiness, must have admired the benevolence
with which Providence has thus bestowed upon the mind
a capability, when it is deprived of one pursuit, of falling back with
redoubled ardour upon another. But Mr. Paine was an exception to
this rule; he was rather the incarnation of a single feeling than a
sharer in the complicated emotions of mankind. Pride was the only
thing that he was conscious of,&mdash;the one point from which all his
ideas radiated; and, when this was destroyed, his existence might
virtually be considered at an end.</p>

<p>From the moment that he had received the wretched scrawl, the
alteration which took place in this unhappy man was of the most extraordinary
kind. He had never been suspicious, for, loveless though
he was, the possibility that <em>his</em> wife could sink to frailty had never
entered into his mind; but, when the idea was once aroused, he
seemed without hesitation to receive it as a truth; and that that
truth should be forced upon him by the agency of a person who was
evidently of the lowest class was an aggravation of the keenest kind.
His spirit was from that day broken. Homage seemed a mockery,
for he felt that the most despised among those who showed him reverence
possessed a more enviable lot than it could ever be his fate
to know again.</p>

<p>For a few days the secret remained fixed in his own heart,&mdash;that
heart which had sought to citadel itself in its indomitable pride, and
which was now crushed and powerless. At length to Fraser, by
whom his altered manner had been remarked, he ventured to ask,
with an air of forced coldness, "Whether it had ever occurred to
him that Mr. Langton had been in the habit of paying more than
proper attentions to the mother of the boy whom he had rescued?&mdash;he
did not mean to hint that those attentions had been encouraged
or received&mdash;that of course was out of the question; but still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated; and Fraser, deceived by the quietude of his manner,
thought it a very good opportunity to say a few words upon a subject
that had given him some little annoyance. He readily avowed
"that he entertained no very high opinion of the gentleman in question,
but" (of course) "his opinion of Mrs. Paine's correct feeling
was so strong that he thought the matter need cause very little discomfort.
Nevertheless, he imagined it would be as well to intimate
to Mr. Langton that his constant attendance in the Regent's Park
was no longer expected or desired."</p>

<p>This was the confirmation that was sought&mdash;the vulgar letter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
accurate enough&mdash;all the world were pointing at him. Fraser had
noticed it, but in delicacy to his feelings, and in gallantry to his
wife, had forborne to speak more explicitly: he had no remedy;
wronged as he was, he had no remedy. He might go into a court
of justice, and there, in consideration of his shame being recorded
upon oath, he might receive a sum equal to about a tithe of his
yearly income. He might kill the man; and then also the world,
with whom suspicion only might exist at present, would be certified
of the fact. No; his course was run,&mdash;there was but one way left
for him to pursue.</p>

<p>It was dusk on a summer's evening, a few days after this, that
Caroline and Langton met for the last time.</p>

<p>"Charles," she said, "it is not a resolution lightly formed; it has
cost me a struggle which I knew I should experience, but which I
never expected to have conquered, you must not see me more!
Nay, do not utter one word of remonstrance; you may by so doing
make the separation more bitter, but you cannot shake my resolution.
I dare not trust myself to say all that now rushes to my mind; yet,
perhaps, parting as we do for ever, I may be forgiven for saying that
I always loved you: this I could not help; but, with such a feeling, I
ought to have shown more strength of mind than to have sacrificed
your happiness and my own even to a parent's wish. I failed to do
so, and it is right that the penalty should be borne. Farewell! You
can appreciate all that I now suffer, and you will tell me that you love
me better for the determination which I have made. Believe me, a
time will come when you will praise God that I had sufficient strength
to endure the agony of this trial. We have been very foolish,&mdash;we
ought never to have met; but thank Heaven that, having met, we have
escaped from guilt. There, now leave me&mdash;pray leave me, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment they were interrupted by a hasty knock at the
street-door; they stood still for a moment: it was Mr. Paine. He
seemed, upon entering, to make some inquiries of the servant: he
ascended the stairs, paused for an instant at the drawing-room door,
as if about to open it, and then with a hurried step ascended to his
dressing-room above. Caroline and Langton moved not; they seemed
to dread some coming event, and yet they had no definite ground
for fear. Several minutes elapsed: at length Langton smiled and
was about to speak, when they heard a heavy, lumbering fall upon
the floor above, followed by a long, low groan, the sound of which
was never afterwards forgotten.</p>

<p>We willingly draw a veil over the circumstances of this scene, and
have only now to detail the events to which it ultimately led.</p>

<p>The parting between Caroline and Langton on that dreadful night
was <em>final</em>: he made an attempt to see her once more during the period
of her suffering, but this she positively refused. The suicide of
her unhappy husband caused some little talk at the time; but as it
was proved, to the satisfaction of a coroner's jury, that his death took
place on a Wednesday, and that upon that day he had written a short
note which he had dated "Thursday," they without hesitation returned
a verdict of "Temporary Insanity," and the newspapers saw
no reason for departing from their usual plan, by attributing the rash
act to any other cause than the unsuccessful result of some speculations
on the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>The world, (that is to say, those immediate connexions who became
acquainted with the circumstances of the case,) upon a retrospect of
the affair, condemned Mr. Paine for his pride, Mr. Fraser for his politeness,
and Caroline and Langton for their indiscretion;&mdash;the only
persons mentioned in our story with whom the said "world" found
no fault were&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs!</p>

<p>Mr. Paine had made no alteration in his will, and a large portion
of his property was left to his widow during her life. Caroline passed
some years in deep seclusion, devoting herself to the education of her
children, and seeking consolation in the exercises of religion, wherein
alone she could hope that it might be found. She died at the commencement
of the present year; and an extract from a letter addressed
to Langton, which was discovered among her papers, may
serve to conclude her history, and to impart a moral which may not
be altogether vain.</p>

<p>"You will perhaps be surprised at this request," (she had entreated
that he would undertake the guardianship of her children,) "but,
after all that I have suffered, I could not feel one moment's peace if
I thought it possible that in the course of events a similar fate might
attend upon them. Edward will require little care,&mdash;to the girls
my anxiety is directed: the destiny of women is too often fixed when
they possess little power of judging wisely for themselves; and, even
if they should possess this power, strength of character is required
to enable them to resist all other influences, and to abide firmly by
the judgment they have formed. Remembering that my fate was
thus rendered unhappy, you will not hesitate to guard my children
against the misery I have endured. Watch over them, I entreat you;
and let that love which, when it was bestowed upon me, could lead
only to sorrow, descend upon them with the consciousness of purity.
I know that you will do this; I know, above all, that in affairs of the
heart you will consult their feelings of affection rather than their
dreams of pride; and while, on the one hand, you prohibit a union
that might degrade them, you will, on the other, be equally cautious
never to <em>enforce</em> the acceptance of 'an excellent offer.'"</p>

<p>The diamond is precious from its scarcity, and, for the same
reason, a new thought is beyond all price. Unluckily for us moderns,
the ages who came before us have seized upon all the best thoughts,
and it is but rarely indeed that we can stumble upon a new one. In
the pride of superior knowledge, we sometimes imagine that we have
succeeded in coining a new thought in the mint of our own brain;
but, ten to one, if we make any researches into the matter, we shall
find our bran new thought in some musty volume whose author
lived a thousand years ago. This is exceedingly provoking, and has
often led me to imagine that the ancients (so miscalled) have been
guilty of the most atrocious plagiarisms from us, who are the real ancients
of the world. It seems as if by some unhallowed species of second-sight
they have been enabled to see down the dim vistas of futurity,
and have thus forestalled us in the possession of the choicest
thoughts and the most original ideas. This is especially the case
with regard to jokes; all the best of them are as old as the hills.
On rare occasions some commanding genius astonishes the world by
a new joke; but this is an event,&mdash;the event of the year in which
the grand thing is uttered. Hardly has it seen the light ere it
passes with the utmost celerity from mouth to mouth; it makes
the tour of all the tables in the kingdom, and is reproduced in newspapers
and magazines, until no corner of the land has been unhonoured
and ungladdened by its presence. Reader! it was once my
fortune to be the creator, the Ποιητὴς, of a witticism of surpassing
excellence,&mdash;of a joke which, as soon as it proceeded from my brain,
made a dozen professed wits ready to burst with envy at my superior
genius! Many a time since, has that bright scintillation of intellectual
light brought smiles into the faces, and gladness into the hearts
of millions! and many a joyous cachinnation has it caused, to the sensible
diminution of apothecaries' bills and undertakers' fees! If I had
been a diner-out, I might have provided myself with dinners for two
years upon the strength of it; but I was contented with the honour,
and left the profit to the smaller wits, who, by a process well known
to themselves, contrive to extract venison out of jests, and champagne
out of puns. For years I have reposed on my laurels as the inventor
of a new thought; and, but for the hope that there were still
more worlds to conquer, I would have folded my arms in dignified resignation,
and acknowledged to myself that I had not lived in vain.
About a month ago, however, my complacent pride in my production
received a severe check; and circumstances ensued which have led
me to doubt whether in these degenerate days it is possible for a
man to imagine any new thought. I was in the society of half a
dozen men of real wit, but of no pretension,&mdash;men of too joyous a nature
to be envious of my achievement,&mdash;when one of them actually
uttered my joke,&mdash;the joke upon which I pride myself,&mdash;coolly looking
me in the face, and asserting that he was the author of it. I felt
at first indignant at so dishonest an act; but, convinced of my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
right, I smiled contemptuously, and said nothing. My friend noticed
the smile, and saw that it was not one of mirth but of scorn, and has
ever since treated me with the most marked coolness. When I returned
home I retired to my chamber, and throwing myself into my
comfortable arm-chair, I indulged in a melancholy reverie upon the
vanity of human exertion, and the disposition so common among
mankind to rob the great of their dearly-acquired glory. "Even
Homer," said I to myself, "did not escape the universal fate. Some
deny his very existence, and assert that his sublime epic was the
combined work of several ballad-mongers; others, again, generously
acknowledge his existence, but still assert that he was no poet, but
the mere singer of the verses that abler men composed! And, if
Homer has not escaped detraction and injustice, shall I?" These,
and similar thoughts, gradually growing more and more confused and
indistinct, occupied my attention for a full hour. A bottle of champagne,
corked up and untasted, stood upon the table before me. It
was just the dim faint dawn of early morning; and in the grey obscurity
I could plainly distinguish the black bottle as it stood between
me and the window. Notwithstanding the hour, I felt half-inclined
to take a draught of the generous juice it contained, and was stretching
forth my hand for that purpose, when, to my great surprise, the
bottle gave a sudden turn, and commenced dancing round the table.
Gradually two arms sprouted forth from its sides; and, giving them
a joyous twirl, the bottle skipped about more nimbly than before, and
to my eyes seemed endeavouring to dance a Highland fling. I
thought this very extraordinary behaviour on the part of the bottle.
I rubbed my eyes, but I was wide awake. I pinched myself, and
came to the same conclusion. As I continued to gaze, the mysterious
bottle grew larger and larger, and suddenly sprung up as tall as
myself. Immediately afterwards, the cork, which had become supernaturally
large and round, changed colour, and turned to a ruddy
hue; and I could by degrees distinguish a pair of sparkling eyes,
and a whole set of rubicund features smiling upon me with the most
benign expression. The forehead of this apparition was high and
bald, and marked with wrinkles,&mdash;not of decrepitude, but of a hale old
age,&mdash;while a few thin grey hairs hung straggling over his temples.
As soon as my astonishment was able to vent itself in words, I addressed
the apparition in a query, which has since become extremely
popular, and called out to it, "Who are you?"</p>

<div class="caption">The Autobiography of a Joke</div>
</div>

<p>Ere it had time to reply to this classical question, my eyes fell
upon a roll of parchment which it held in its hand, and on which
were inscribed the magic words of my joke.</p>

<p>"Do you not know me?" said this Eidolon of my wit, pointing
to the scroll. "I am the joke upon which you pride yourself, and,
although I say it myself, one of the best jokes that ever was uttered.
Don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"I can't say that I should have recognised you," said I, as I felt
my heart yearning with paternal kindness towards him; "but&mdash;Come
to my arms, my son, my progeny!"</p>

<p>"Aha! ha! ha!" said the Joke, looking at me with very unfilial
impertinence, and holding his sides with laughter.</p>

<p>"The contempt with which you treat me is exceedingly unbecoming,"
said I with much warmth, and with the air of an offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
parent; "and, what is more, sir, it is unfeeling and unnatural&mdash;'tis
past a joke, sir!"</p>

<p>"'Tis no joke!" said the Joke, still laughing with all his might,
and peering at me from the corners of his eyes, the only parts of those
orbits which mirth permitted to remain open; "really, my good
friend, the honour to which you lay claim is nowise yours. Lord
bless your foolish vanity! I was a patriarch before the days of your
great grandfather!"</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" said I, "it cannot be! You know that you are my
production;&mdash;you cannot be serious in denying it."</p>

<p>"I am not often serious," said the Joke, putting on a look of comic
gravity; "but there is no reason for so much solemnity in telling an
unimportant truth. However, we will not argue the point; I will
proceed at once to tell you my history, to convince you how little
claim you have to the honours of paternity in my case."</p>

<p>"I shall be very happy," said I, with more reverence than I had
yet assumed towards my mysterious visitor.</p>

<p>"For fear you should find me dry," said the Joke, "get a bottle of
wine."</p>

<p>I did as I was desired, drew the cork, filled two glasses, one of
which I handed to the Joke, who, nodding good-humouredly at me,
commenced the following narrative.</p>


<p class="center f90">THE JOKE'S STORY.</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest recollection of my progenitors; like the
great Pharaohs who built the pyramids, their names have sunk into
oblivion in the lapse of ages. They must, however, have lived more
than thirty centuries ago, as my reminiscences extend nearly as far
back as that period. I could, if I would, draw many curious pictures
of the state of society in those early ages, having mixed all my life
with persons of every rank and condition, and traversed many celebrated
regions. I say it with pride that I have always delighted to
follow in the track of civilization, and claim as a great honour to
myself and the other members of my fraternity, that we have in some
degree contributed to hasten the mighty march of human intelligence.
It is only savage nations who are too solemn and too stupid to appreciate
a joke, and upon these people I never condescended to
throw myself away. One of my earliest introductions to society took
place about two thousand five hundred years ago, among a company
of merchants who were traversing the great deserts of Arabia. Methinks
I see their faces now, and the very spot where they first made
acquaintance with me. It was towards sunset, under a palm-tree,
beside a fountain, where the caravan had stopped to drink the refreshing
waters. It has been often said that grave people love a joke,
and it was a grave old trader who showed me off on this occasion, to
the infinite delight of his companions, who laughed at my humour
till the tears ran down their cheeks. In this manner I traversed the
whole of civilized Asia, and visited at different periods the luxurious
tables of Sardanapalus and Ahasuerus, and brought smiles into the
faces of the queenly beauties of their courts. From Asia I passed
into Greece, and I remember that I used often to sit with the soldiers
round their watch-fires at the siege of Troy. At a much later
period I was introduced to Homer, and shall always remember with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
pleasure that I was the means of procuring him a supper when, but
for me, he would have gone without one. The poor peasants to whom
the still poorer bard applied for a supper and a lodging, had no relish
for poetry; but they understood a joke, and the bard brought me
forth for their entertainment; and, while my self-love was flattered by
their hearty laughter, his wants were supplied by their generous hospitality.
But I was not only acquainted with Homer, for Aristophanes
very happily introduced me into one of his lost comedies.
Anacreon and I were boon companions; and, while upon this part of
my career, you will permit me to give vent to a little honest pride,
by informing you in few words that I once brought a smile into the
grave face of the divine Plato; that I was introduced into an argument
by no less an orator than Demosthenes; that I was familiarly
known to Esop; that I supped with Socrates; and was equally well
received in the court of Philip of Macedon and the camp of his victorious
son. Still a humble follower in the train of civilization, I
passed over to Rome. I was not very well received by the stiff,
stern men of the republic; but in the age of Augustus I was universally
admired. The first time that I excited any attention was at
the table of Mecænas, when Horace was present. I may mention
by the way that it was Horace himself who, in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>, first made
known my merits to his illustrious patron, and the latter took the
first opportunity of showing me off. I was never in my life more flattered
than at the enthusiastic reception I met from the men of genius
there assembled, although I have since thought that I was somewhat
indebted for my success to the wealth and station of the illustrious
joker. However that may be, my success was certain; and so much
was I courted, that I was compelled to visit every house in Rome
where wit and good-humour stood any chance of being appreciated.
After living in this manner for about a hundred years, I took it into
my head to go to sleep; and I slept so long, that, when I awoke, I
found the victorious Hun in the streets of the city. This was no
time for me to show my face; and, seeing so little prospect of happy
times for me and my race, I thought I could not do better than go
to sleep again. I did so, and when I awoke this second time found
myself at the gay court of old king René of Provence. Among the
bright ladies and amorous troubadours who held their revels there, I
was much esteemed. There was, however, I am bound in candour to
admit, some falling-off in my glory about this period. I was admitted
to the tables of the great, it is true; but I was looked upon as a
humble dependent, and obliged to eat out of the same platter with
the hired jester. I could not tolerate this unworthy treatment for
ever, and it had such an effect upon me that I soon lost much of my
wonted spirit and humour. In fact, I was continually robbed of my
point by these professed wits, and often made to look uncommonly
stupid; so much so, that my friends sometimes doubted of my identity,
and denied that I was the same joke they had been accustomed to
laugh at. I contrived, however, to be revenged occasionally upon
the unlucky jesters who introduced me <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal-à-propos</i>. They used to
forget that their masters were not always in a humour to be tickled
by a joke, and a sound drubbing was very often the only reward of
their ill-timed merriment. This was some slight consolation to me;
but I could not tolerate long the low society of these hired buffoons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
and, as I did not feel sleepy, I was obliged to think of some scheme
by which I might escape the continual wear and tear, and loss of
polish, that I suffered at their hands. I at last resolved to shut myself
up in a monastery, and lead a life of tranquillity and seclusion.
You need not smile because so merry a personage as myself chose to
be immured within the walls of a monastery, for I assure you that in
the intellectual society of the monks,&mdash;the only intellectual society
that one could meet with in those days,&mdash;I was soon restored to my
original brightness. I lived so well and so luxuriously among these
good people, that I quickly grew sleek and lazy, and somehow or
other I fell into a doze, from which I was not awakened until a wit
in the reign of Elizabeth stumbled upon me, and again brought me
out into the busy world. I ran a splendid career in England."</p>

<p>"Did you?" said I, interrupting the Joke at this part of his narrative,
and appealing to him with considerable energy of manner,
for I began to be apprehensive that some of my friends, more learned
than myself, might have discovered the antiquity of my "joke," and
would quiz me on the subject. I restrained my impetuosity, however,
and, with some alarm depicted in my countenance, I asked him
in a trembling voice, "Did you&mdash;did you&mdash;ever&mdash;meet with&mdash;Joe
Miller?"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;Joe Miller!" said the Joke with much vivacity; "I suffered
more from the dread of that fellow than I ever suffered in my life.
I had the greatest difficulty in keeping out of his way, and I only
managed it by going to sleep again. You awoke me from that
slumber, when, like many others who came before you, you passed
me off as your own. You remember you got much credit for me,
as all ever have done who have good sense enough to introduce
me only at a proper time, and wit enough to launch me forth with all
my native grace and brilliancy about me."</p>

<p>"Then you are not a Joe?" said I, much relieved.</p>

<p>"A Joe!" said the Joke, reddening with anger. "Have I not told
you already that I am not? Do you mean to insult me by the vile
insinuation that I ever showed my face in such despicable company?
Do you think, sir, that I am a pun?"</p>

<p>"Oh, by no means," said I; "I assure you I meant no offence."</p>

<p>"You did, sir," replied the Joke, striking his fist upon the table
with great vehemence. Immediately afterwards I observed that his
face became dreadfully distorted, and he shook his head convulsively
from side to side. As I continued to gaze without the power of saying
a single word to calm the irritation I had so unintentionally raised,
I noticed that his neck grew every instant longer and longer, until
his chin seemed to be fully two feet from his shoulders. I was unable
to endure the sight, and rising up, half frantic with nervous excitement,
I put my hand convulsively upon his head, with the benevolent
intention of squeezing it down to its proper level. He glared
furiously at me with his swollen eyes, and, horrible to relate, just as
I came in contact with him, his head flew off with a tremendous explosion,
and bounced right through a chimney-glass that ornamented
my mantel-piece. The glass flew in shivers round me. In a dreadful
state of alarm I rang the bell for assistance, and sank down overpowered
upon the chair.</p>

<p>"Beggin' your honour's pardon for being so bould," said my tiger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
a good-natured Irish boy named Phelim, who had entered at the summons,
"I think your honour had better drink a bottle of soda-water
and go to bed."</p>

<p>"Where's his head, Phelim?" said I.</p>

<p>"Your own, or the bed's?" said Phelim.</p>

<p>"The Joke's," replied I.</p>

<p>"Och, you must mane your own; it's light enough, I dare say,"
said Phelim as he pulled my boots off. "You took a dhrop too much
last night, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Phelim," said I solemnly, "did you hear nothing?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I did," said Phelim. "Haven't you, like a drunken
baste as you are, (begging your pardon for my bouldness,) been trying
to broach that bottle of champagne at this early hour of the mornin',
and haven't you driven the cork through the lookin'-glass?"</p>

<p>I looked at the bottle; it was uncorked, and the champagne was
even at that moment sparkling over the neck of the bottle, and running
over my books and papers.</p>

<p>"A pretty piece of work you have made of it," said Phelim, picking
up the cork and pointing to the looking-glass.</p>

<p>"'Twas a good joke," said I, although my faith was somewhat
staggered by Phelim's explanation.</p>

<p>"Troth, an' I'm glad you take it so asy," said Phelim, ramming
the cork into the bottle; "you'll find it a dear one when the landlady
brings in her bill for the lookin'-glass. But never mind it, sir,
now. Go to bed and get sober."</p>

<p>I took Phelim's advice, and went to bed. To this day I am unable
positively to decide whether his explanation was the true one or not. I
incline, however, to the belief that I was <em>not</em> drunk, but that the illustrious
<span class="smcap">Joke</span> actually visited me in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">propriâ personâ</i>. I am the more
inclined to this belief from the remarkable coherency of his narrative,
which I now leave, without a word of comment, to the consideration
of the curious.</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="THE_SECRET" id="THE_SECRET"></a>THE SECRET.</h2>

<p class="center f90">TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF M. PAUL DE KOCK.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nathalie de Hauteville</span> at the age of twenty-two had been
for three years a widow. She was one of the most beautiful women
in Paris; a brunette, with large black eyes, and one of those
fascinating faces whose charm consists more in expression than in regularity
of features, and in which are portrayed at once all the elegance
of the Frenchwoman, all the vivacity of the Italian, and all the
fire of a daughter of Spain.</p>

<p>When she married, at eighteen, a man of nearly three times her
age, Nathalie, a mere child in character, had not bestowed a thought
on any thing beyond her wedding dresses, her marriage presents, and
the delight of being called Madame. Her husband was as generous
to her as he was rich. Twelve months had passed in a continued
round of gaiety and amusement, when M. de Hauteville was suddenly
attacked by a disease which carried him off in a few days,
and left his young widow to mourn for a husband as she would have
mourned for the loss of a friend and protector.</p>

<p>But, at eighteen, sorrow soon passes away; the heart is so new to
every feeling, to every illusion. Madame de Hauteville found that
she was courted by the world; that she was invited everywhere;
and that, by her fortune and her position, she was called upon to become
an ornament of society. Yet she felt that she was too young
to live without a mentor, and to go out alone; so she asked her uncle,
M. d'Ablaincourt, to come and live with her.</p>

<p>M. d'Ablaincourt was an old bachelor: one love only, had he ever
known, and the object of that was&mdash;himself. His love for himself
was paramount; and, if ever he went so far as to show any liking for
any other individual, he must have received from that individual such
attention as to make him a gainer by their intimacy. M. d'Ablaincourt
was an egotist; but, at the same time, a well-bred, a well-mannered
egotist. He had all the air of devoting himself to the wishes
of others, whilst he was exclusively occupied in compassing his own;
he would appear to be taking a lively interest in those around him,
whilst, in reality, he never felt any interest in anybody but himself.
Too thoughtless to do harm, he was as little disposed to do good, unless
it were for his own advantage. In short, he liked to be at his
ease, and to be surrounded with all the enjoyments which luxury
could invent. Such was the character of M. d'Ablaincourt, who
readily acceded to his niece's proposal, because Nathalie, though a
little giddy, had a good and affectionate heart, and would load him
with kindnesses and attentions.</p>

<p>M. d'Ablaincourt went out into the world with his niece, because
he had not yet lost his relish for its pleasures; but, if an invitation
came for any party which he thought held out no amusement for him,
he would turn to her, and say, "I am afraid, my dear, you will not
like this party; there will be nothing at all but play. I shall be
very happy to take you; you know I always do exactly as you wish,
but I think you will find it dull." And Nathalie, who was all confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
in her uncle, never failed to answer, "You are quite right,
uncle; it will be much better for us not to go."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 508px;">
<a id="SECRET"></a><img src="images/i383.jpg" width="508" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">The Secret</div>
</div>

<p>So it was with everything else. M. d'Ablaincourt, who, without
wishing to be thought so, was an excessive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gourmand</i>, said one day to
his niece, "You know, my dear, I am no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gourmand</i>; I care very little
myself how things are served up, and am always satisfied with what
is laid before me; but your cook puts too much salt in everything,
which is not wholesome for a young woman; and then, she sends up
her dishes in a careless, slovenly way, which is very annoying to me
on your account, as you often give dinners. The other day there
were six people at table, and the spinage was badly dressed. You
must consider what people will say of your management when they
see such neglect. They will say that Madame de Hauteville has
no idea of having things as they ought to be; and this may do you
harm, as there are persons who notice everything."</p>

<p>"What you say is very true, dear uncle; will you take the trouble
of looking out for a good cook for me?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, my love; you know I think nothing of trouble when
I can be of service to you."</p>

<p>"How lucky I am in having you always by me to tell me of all
these little things, which I should never think of!" said Nathalie, kissing
her uncle; and he, good old man, forthwith discharged the cook
who dressed the spinage badly, to make way for one who shone particularly
in all <em>his</em> favourite dishes.</p>

<p>Another time some improvements were to be made in the garden;
for instance, the trees in front of the old gentleman's windows were
to be felled, because they might occasion a dampness which would
be dangerous for Nathalie. And then, the elegant calash was to be
exchanged for a landau, as being a carriage in which a young lady
could be much more at her ease. So minutely attentive was M.
d'Ablaincourt to the comforts and enjoyments of his niece!</p>

<p>Nathalie was somewhat of a coquette: accustomed to conquest, she
used to listen with a smile to the numerous proposals which were
made to her, and sent off all suitors to her uncle, telling them, "Before
I can give you any hope, I must know what M. d'Ablaincourt
thinks of you."</p>

<p>Had her heart favoured any individual, it is probable that the answer
of Nathalie would have been different; but, as it was, she thought
nothing could be more agreeable than to please all, and be the slave
of none.</p>

<p>The old gentleman, for his part, being master in his niece's house,
was not at all anxious that she should marry again. A nephew might
be less inclined to give way, less indulgent to him than Nathalie, so
that he never failed to find some serious fault in every fresh aspirant
to the hand of the pretty widow, and, as in every other case, he
seemed to be thinking of nothing but her happiness.</p>

<p>In addition to his egotism, and his fondness for good living, M.
d'Ablaincourt had of late years been seized with a violent passion
for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>. His favourite pastime, his highest delight, was this
game; but, unfortunately for him, it was one very little played. The
ladies do not like it in a room, because it is noisy; the gentlemen
prefer <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillotte</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écarté</i>; so that the old gentleman very seldom
found an opportunity of indulging his propensity. If any of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
niece's visitors did happen to play, he seized upon them for the
whole evening;&mdash;there was no possibility of escape. But, as they
did not come to the pretty widow's for the sake of a game at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>
with the old uncle, many were the nights he sighed in vain for somebody
to play with.</p>

<p>To please her uncle, Nathalie attempted to learn; but in vain.
She was too giddy to give the necessary attention, and was continually
making mistakes: the uncle scolded; and at last, Nathalie,
throwing away dice and dice-box, said, "It is no use,&mdash;I never can
learn this game."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for it," answered M. d'Ablaincourt, "very sorry; it
would have given you so much pleasure. I only wished to teach it
you for your own amusement."</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs, when, at a very large party, where
Nathalie was allowed to stand unrivalled for personal beauty and elegance
of dress, was announced M. d'Apremont, a captain in the
navy.</p>

<p>Nathalie expected to see a blunt, gruff old sailor, with a wooden
leg, and a black patch on his eye. To her great astonishment there
entered a tall, handsome young man, with a graceful figure and
commanding air, and without either a wooden leg or a black patch.</p>

<p>Armand d'Apremont had entered the service very early in life;
his whole soul was in his profession; and, though only thirty, he had
risen to the rank of captain. His family property was considerable,
and he had increased his fortune by his own exertions. Under these
circumstances it is not surprising that, after fifteen years spent at
sea, he should have yielded to a longing for repose; yet he never
could be persuaded to listen to the solicitations of his friends, who
urged him to marry: hitherto he had only laughed at love as a
passion unworthy of a sailor.</p>

<p>The sight of Nathalie changed all his ideas,&mdash;the whole man
underwent a sudden revolution. He watched her dancing, and could
look nowhere else. All the other beauties in the room passed before
him but as vain shadows, so busy were his eyes in following
the graceful movements of the young widow.</p>

<p>"Who is that lovely creature who dances so beautifully?" at
last he exclaimed to a person next him.</p>

<p>"That is Madame de Hauteville, a young widow. You admire
her, captain?"</p>

<p>"I think her enchanting."</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful! And her mental qualifications are at
least equal to her personal charms. But you must ask her to dance,
and then you will be able to judge for yourself."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> ask her to dance! I never danced in my life!" and for the
first time Armand felt that this was a deficiency in his education.
However, he went and stood close to the beauty, watching an opportunity
of entering into conversation with her. Once he was on the
very point of succeeding, when a young man came up, and led her
away to the quadrille. Poor Armand bit his lips, and was obliged
again to content himself with admiring her dancing. This whole
evening he made no further advances, but he did not lose sight of
his enchantress for an instant.</p>

<p>The captain's behaviour did not pass unobserved by Nathalie,&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
soon do women see what effect they produce,&mdash;and, although she
did not appear to notice it, she felt secretly not a little flattered;
for D'Apremont had been described to her as a man who was far
from agreeable in the society of ladies, and who had never been
known to pay a single compliment. And Nathalie said to herself,
"What fun it would be to hear him make love!"</p>

<p>D'Apremont, who, before he had seen Nathalie, went very little
into society, particularly to balls, from henceforth never missed going
wherever he had a chance of meeting his fair widow. He had
succeeded in speaking to her, and had done his utmost to render
himself agreeable. His behaviour was entirely changed, and the
world was not more slow than usual in discovering the cause, or in
commenting upon the marked attention which he paid to Nathalie.</p>

<p>"Mind you are not caught, captain!" a good-natured friend would
say. "Madame de Hauteville is a coquette, who will but make a
toy of your love, and a joke of your sighs." And to Nathalie some
equally kind friend would say, "The captain is an original, a bear,
with every fault that a sailor can possess. He is passionate, he is
obstinate, he swears, he smokes. You will never make anything of
him."</p>

<p>In spite of these charitable warnings,&mdash;the result, perhaps, of envy
and jealousy,&mdash;the sailor and the coquette enjoyed a mutual pleasure
in each other's society. Whenever D'Apremont was on the point of
forgetting himself, and letting out an expression a little too nautical,
Nathalie looked at him with a slight frown. He stopped short, stammered,
and dared not finish his sentence, so afraid was he of seeing a
harsh look on that pretty face. Nor is it a slight proof of the mighty
power of love that it can thus implant fear in the breast of a sailor.</p>

<p>Some rumours of his niece's new conquest had reached the ears of
M. d'Ablaincourt; but he had paid but little attention to them, thinking
that this new admirer would share the fate of all the others, and
that it would be very easy to get him dismissed. Yet the report had
so far increased, that when Nathalie one day told her uncle that she
had asked the captain to her house, the old gentleman almost flew
into a passion, and said, with a vehemence quite uncommon to him,
"You have acted very wrong, Nathalie; you do not consult me as
you ought. I am told that Captain d'Apremont is a blunt, unpolished,
quarrelsome&mdash;&mdash;. He is always behind your chair, and he has never
even asked <em>me</em> how I did. There was no necessity at all for you to
ask him. You know, my dear," added he, softening his tone, "all I
say is for your good; but indeed you are too thoughtless."</p>

<p>Nathalie, quite afraid that she had acted very inconsiderately, was
going to put off the captain; but this the uncle did not require:&mdash;he
thought he should be able to prevent too frequent a repetition of his
visits.</p>

<p>It is a trite observation, that the most important events in life are
frequently the result of the most trivial incidents,&mdash;that on a mere
thread, which chance has flung in our way, may hang our whole future
destiny. Such was the case in the present instance: to the game of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i> it was owing that Madame de Hauteville became Madame
d'Apremont. The captain was an excellent player; and happening
in the course of conversation to broach the subject, M. d'Ablaincourt
caught at him immediately, and proposed a game. D'Apremont consented;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and, having understood that it was necessary to play the
agreeable to the old uncle, spent the whole evening at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>.</p>

<p>When everybody was gone, Nathalie complained of the captain's
want of gallantry,&mdash;that he had hardly paid her any attention at all.</p>

<p>"You were quite right," said she pettishly to her uncle; "sailors
are very disagreeable people. I am very sorry I ever asked M.
d'Apremont."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, my dear," replied the old bachelor, "we had
formed quite an erroneous opinion of M. d'Apremont. I found him
so agreeable and so well-bred, that I have asked him to come very
often to play with me,&mdash;I mean, to pay his court to you. He is a very
clever, gentlemanlike young man."</p>

<p>Nathalie, seeing that the captain had won the heart of her uncle,
pardoned his want of attention to her. Thanks to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>, and to his
being necessary to M. d'Ablaincourt's amusement, he came very often
to the house, and at last succeeded in winning the heart of the young
widow. One morning she came, her face covered with blushes, to
tell her uncle that M. d'Apremont had proposed to her, and to ask
his advice.</p>

<p>The old gentleman thought for a few minutes, and he said to himself,
"If she refuses him, there will be an end to his visits here; no
more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>. If she accepts him, he will be one of the family; I
shall always be able to nail him for a game;" and the answer was,
"You cannot do better than accept him."</p>

<p>The happiness of Nathalie was complete, for she really loved Armand;
but, as a woman never should seem to yield too easily, she
sent for the captain to dictate her conditions.</p>

<p>"If it is true that you love me," she began.</p>

<p>"<em>If</em> it is true! Oh, madame, I swear by all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Allow me to speak first. If you love me, you will not hesitate to
give me the proofs I demand."</p>

<p>"Whatever you ask, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the first place, you must no longer swear as you do occasionally;
it is a shocking habit before a lady: secondly,&mdash;and on this
point I insist more particularly,&mdash;you must give up smoking, for I
hate the smell of a pipe of tobacco; in short, I never will have a husband
who smokes."</p>

<p>Armand heaved a sigh, and answered, "To please you I will submit
to anything,&mdash;I will give up smoking."</p>

<p>Her conditions being thus acceded to, the fair widow could no
longer withhold her hand, and in a short time Armand and Nathalie
reappeared in the world as a newly-married and happy couple. Yet
the world was not satisfied. "How could that affected flirt marry a
sailor?" said one. "So, the rough captain has let himself be caught
by the pretty widow's coquetry," said another. "This is a couple
ill-matched enough."</p>

<p>Poor judges of the human heart are they who imagine a resemblance
of disposition to be essential to love! On the contrary, the
most happy effects are produced by contrast: mark but the union of
light and shade; and is not strength wanting to uphold weakness:&mdash;the
wild bursts of mirth to dispel melancholy? You join together two
kindred tempers, two similar organisations, and what is the result?
'Tis as the blind leading the blind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Our young couple passed the first few months after their marriage
in undisturbed happiness. Yet in the midst of the rapture he experienced
in the society of his lovely bride, Armand sometimes became
pensive, his brow was contracted, and his eyes betrayed a secret uneasiness:
but this lasted not; it was but as a fleeting cloud, which
passes without leaving a trace. Nathalie had not hitherto perceived
it. After some time, however, these moments of restlessness and
gloom recurred so frequently as no longer to escape her observation.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my love?" said she to her husband one day
when she saw him stamping his foot with impatience; "what makes
you so cross?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing at all!" answered the captain, as if ashamed of
having lost his self-possession. "With whom do you think I should
be cross?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear, I know not; but I have fancied several times
that I perceived a something impatient in your manner. If I have
unconsciously done anything to vex you, do tell me, that it may
never happen again."</p>

<p>The captain kissed his wife affectionately, and again assured her
that she was mistaken. For some days he manifested none of those
emotions which had so disturbed Nathalie; but at length the same
thing occurred again: Armand forgot himself once more, and she
racked her brain to guess what cause her husband could have for this
uneasiness. Not being satisfied with her own solution of the problem,
she communicated her thoughts to her uncle, who replied immediately,
"Yes, my dear, you are quite right; I am sure something must
be the matter with D'Apremont; for several times lately, at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>
he has looked round with an abstracted air, passed his hand across his
temples, and finished by making an egregious blunder."</p>

<p>"But, my good uncle, what can the mystery be? My husband
must have some secret which preys upon his mind, and he does not
choose to trust me with it."</p>

<p>"Very likely; there are many things which a man cannot tell his
wife."</p>

<p>"Which a man cannot tell his wife! That is a thing I do not understand.
I expect my husband to tell me everything, to have no
mysteries with me, as I have none with him. I can never be happy
so long as he on whom I have bestowed my heart, keeps any secret
from me."</p>

<p>M. d'Ablaincourt, to comfort his niece, or rather, perhaps, to cut
short a conversation which began to bore him, promised to do his
utmost to discover the cause of his nephew's uneasiness; but he went
no further than trying to make him play oftener at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>, as being
an excellent method of keeping him in good humour.</p>

<p>Early in the summer they left Paris for a beautiful property belonging
to the captain in the neighbourhood of Fontainebleau. He
appeared still as fond of his wife as ever; to afford her pleasure was
his delight, to anticipate her wishes his study; but, as she was not
fond of walking, he begged to be allowed to take a stroll into the
country every day after dinner. This was too natural a request to
be denied; and after dinner, whether they were alone or not, out went
Armand, and returned in the best humour imaginable. Still Nathalie
was far from being satisfied; her suspicions returned, and she said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
herself, "My husband has no longer the serious, gloomy look he used
to wear in Paris; but it is only since he has gone out every evening
after dinner. Sometimes he is away two hours,&mdash;where can he go?&mdash;and
he always likes to be alone. There is some mystery in his
conduct, and I shall never be happy until I have found it out."</p>

<p>Sometimes Nathalie thought of having her husband followed; but
this was a step too repugnant to her feelings. To take a servant into
her confidence, to place a spy on the path of a man the business of
whose life seemed to be to give her pleasure, she felt would be wrong,
and she gave up the idea. To her uncle alone she ventured to disclose
her anxiety, and he simply answered, "True, your husband
plays less at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>, but still he does play; and as to my following
him in his walks, it is out of the question, for he has very good legs,
and I have very bad ones;&mdash;I should be fatiguing myself to no purpose."</p>

<p>One day that Madame d'Apremont gave a party, a young man
present said, laughing, to the master of the house,</p>

<p>"What were you doing yesterday, Armand, in the disguise of a
peasant at the window of a little cottage about half a mile from
hence? If my horse had not started, I was coming to ask if you were
feeding your sheep."</p>

<p>"My husband in the disguise of a peasant!" exclaimed Nathalie,
fixing her eyes upon Armand in amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh! Edward has made a mistake," replied the captain, endeavouring
to conceal a visible embarrassment; "he must have taken somebody
else for me."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said the young man, hurt at the impression which
his words had made upon Nathalie, and perceiving that he had been
guilty of an indiscretion; "I must have been deceived."</p>

<p>"How was the man dressed?" asked Nathalie. "Where was the
cottage?"</p>

<p>"Really I know the country so little, I should have some difficulty
in finding the spot. As for the man, he had on a blue smock-frock,
with a sort of cap on his head. I don't know what could have put it
into my head that it was the captain, as it is not the carnival."</p>

<p>Madame d'Apremont said no more on the subject, but remained
persuaded that it <em>was</em> her husband. The assumption of a disguise
proved that he was engaged in some extraordinary intrigue, and in
a flood of tears poor Nathalie complained of the bitterness of her lot
in having married a man of mysteries.</p>

<p>Whether secrets of this nature are the only ones which women
can keep, far be it from me to decide; but certain it is that they
always connect some infidelity with those of our sex. Madame
d'Apremont did not form an exception to this general observation,
and in a fit of jealousy she begged to return to town. Her husband
consented immediately, and in a few days they were in Paris. Here
the captain again betrayed the same symptoms of discontent, until
one day he said to his wife, "My dear, a walk after dinner does
me a great deal of good. During the latter part of our stay in the
country I was quite well in consequence. You can easily conceive
that an old sailor wants exercise, and that he cannot remain cooped
up in a room or a theatre all the evening."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! very easily," replied Nathalie, biting her lips with spleen;
"go and take your walk, if it does you good."</p>

<p>"But, my love, if it annoys you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! not in the least; take your walk; I have no objection."</p>

<p>So the husband took his evening walk, returned in excellent spirits,
and again every sign of impatience had vanished.</p>

<p>"My husband is carrying on some intrigue: he loves another,
and cannot live without seeing her," said poor Nathalie to herself.
"This is the secret of his strange conduct, of his ill-humour, and of
his walks. I am very, very wretched; and the more so that when he
is with me he is all kindness, all attention! I know not how I can tell
him that he is a monster, a traitor! But tell him I must, or my
heart will burst! Yet if I could but get some undeniable proof of
his faithlessness. Oh! yes, I will have some proof." And with a
swelling heart, and eyes full of tears, she rushed into her uncle's
room, crying that "she was the most miserable woman alive!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said the old gentleman, burying himself in
his arm-chair. "What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Every day after dinner," answered his niece, sobbing, "my husband
goes out to walk, as he did in the country, and stays away two
hours. When he returns, he is always cheerful and gay, gives me a
thousand little marks of his attention, and swears that he adores me
as he did the day of our marriage. Oh! my good uncle, I can bear
it no longer!&mdash;You must see that this is all treachery and deceit.
Armand is playing me false."</p>

<p>"He plays less with me at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>," was the answer of the imperturbable
uncle; "but still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear uncle, if you do not help me to discover this mystery,
I shall die of grief&mdash;I shall commit some rash act&mdash;I shall get separated
from my husband. Oh! my good uncle, you who are so kind,
so ready to oblige, do render me this service,&mdash;do find out where my
husband goes every evening."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt about my readiness to oblige, seeing that
it has been the business of my life; but really I do not know how I
can serve you."</p>

<p>"Again I repeat, that, if this mystery is not cleared up, you will
lose your niece."</p>

<p>M. d'Ablaincourt had no wish to lose his niece, or, for the matter
of that, his nephew either. He felt that any rupture between the
young couple would disturb the quiet, easy life he was now enjoying,
and he therefore decided upon taking some steps to restore peace.
He pretended to follow the captain; but, finding this fatiguing, he
returned slowly home after a certain time, and said to his niece, "I
have followed your husband more than six times, and he walks very
quietly alone."</p>

<p>"Where, where, my dear uncle?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes one way, and sometimes another; so that all your
suspicions are entirely without foundation."</p>

<p>Nathalie was not duped by this answer, though she pretended to
place implicit confidence in her uncle's words. Determined on discovering
the truth, she sent for a little errand-boy, who stood always
at the corner of their house, and whom she had heard more than
once praised for his quickness and intelligence. Having ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
that he knew her husband by sight, she said to him, "M. d'Apremont
goes out every evening. To-morrow you must follow him,
watch where he goes, and bring me back word immediately. And
take care not to be seen."</p>

<p>The boy promised to execute her orders faithfully, and Nathalie
awaited the morrow with that impatience of which the jealous alone
can form any idea. At length the moment arrived, the captain went
out, and the little messenger was on his track. Trembling, and in a
fever of agitation, Nathalie sat counting the minutes and seconds as
they passed until the return of the boy. Three quarters of an hour
had elapsed when he made his appearance, covered with dust, and in
a violent perspiration.</p>

<p>"Well," said Nathalie in an altered tone of voice, "what have you
seen? Tell me everything."</p>

<p>"Why, ma'am, I followed the master, taking care he shouldn't see
me&mdash;and a long chase it was&mdash;to the Vieille Rue du Temple in the
Marais. There he went into a queer-looking sort of a house,&mdash;I forget
the number, but I should know it again,&mdash;in an alley, and there
was no porter."</p>

<p>"No porter!&mdash;in an alley!&mdash;Oh, the wretch!"</p>

<p>"As soon as the master had gone in," continued the boy, "I went
in too. He kept on going up stairs till he got to the third floor, and
then he took out a key and opened the door."</p>

<p>"The monster!&mdash;he opened the door himself,&mdash;he has a key,&mdash;and
my uncle to take his part! You are quite sure he opened the
door himself,&mdash;that he did not knock?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, ma'am; and, when I heard him shut the door, I went
up softly and peeped in at the keyhole: as there were only two
doors, I soon found the right one; and there I saw the master dragging
a great wooden chest across the room, and then he began to undress
himself."</p>

<p>"To undress himself!&mdash;O Heavens!&mdash;Go on."</p>

<p>"I couldn't see into the corner of the room where he was; but presently
he came out dressed in a grey smock, with a Greek cap on his
head. And so, ma'am, I thought you'd like to know all I'd seen, and
I ran with all my might to tell you."</p>

<p>"You are a very good boy. You must now go and fetch a coach
directly, get up with the coachman, and direct him to the house."</p>

<p>Nathalie, meanwhile, flew to her room, put on a bonnet and shawl,
rushed down to her uncle crying out, "My husband has betrayed me,&mdash;I
am going to catch him;" and before the old gentleman could extract
another word from her, she was out of the house, in the coach, and
gone. In the Vieille Rue du Temple the coach stopped; Nathalie got
out, pale, trembling, and scarcely able to support herself. The boy
showed her the entrance, and she declined his further attendance.
With the help of the hand-rail she ascended a dark narrow staircase
till she reached the third story, when she had just force enough left
to throw herself against the door, and cry out,</p>

<p>"Let me in, or I shall die!"</p>

<p>The door opened, the captain received her in his arms, and she saw
nothing but her husband alone, in a smock and a Greek cap, smoking
a superb Turkish pipe.</p>

<p>"My wife!" exclaimed Armand in utter amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Nathalie, resuming her self-command,&mdash;"your
injured wife, who has discovered your perfidy, and has been made
acquainted with your disguise, and who has come in person to unravel
the mystery of your conduct."</p>

<p>"What, Nathalie!&mdash;could you, then, suppose that I loved another?
You wish to fathom the mystery,&mdash;here it is;" and he showed her the
pipe. "Before our marriage you forbade me to smoke, and I promised
to obey. For some months I kept my promise most faithfully.
Oh! Nathalie, if you did but know what I suffered in consequence,&mdash;the
fretfulness, the depression of spirits under which I laboured for hours
together!&mdash;it was my old friend that I missed, my darling pipe that I
sighed for in vain! At last I could hold out no longer; and, when we
were in the country, happening to go into a cottage where an old
man was smoking, I asked him if he could afford me a place of refuge,
and at the same time lend me a smock and a hat; for I was afraid
that my clothes might betray me. Our arrangements were soon
made; and, thanks to this precaution, you had not the slightest suspicion
of the real cause of my daily absence. Shortly afterwards you
determined upon returning to Paris; and, being obliged to find a new
way of indulging myself with my pipe, I took this little garret, and
brought hither my old dress. You are now, my love, in possession of
the whole mystery, and I trust you will pardon my disobedience. You
see I have done everything in my power to conceal it from you."</p>

<p>Nathalie threw herself into her husband's arms, and cried out in an
ecstasy of delight,</p>

<p>"So this is really all!&mdash;how happy I am! From henceforth, dearest,
you shall smoke as much as you like at home; you shall not have
to hide yourself for that!" and away she went to her uncle with a
face all beaming with joy, to tell him that Armand loved her, adored
her still,&mdash;it was only that he smoked. "But now," added she, "I
am so happy, that he shall smoke as much as he likes."</p>

<p>"The best plan will be," said M. d'Ablaincourt, "for your husband
to smoke as he plays at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tric-trac</i>; and so," thought the old gentleman,
"I shall be sure of my game every evening."</p>

<p>"My dear Nathalie," said the captain, "though I shall take advantage
of the permission you so kindly give me, still I shall be equally
careful not to annoy you, and shall take the same precautions as
before."</p>

<p>"Oh! Armand, you are really too good; but I am so happy at being
undeceived in my suspicions, that I think now, I quite like the smell
of a pipe."</p>

<h3>MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.<br />
BOTTOM, THE WEAVER.</h3>


<p class="blockquot">"Some men are born with a silver spoon in their mouths, and others with a
wooden ladle."&mdash;<cite>Ancient Proverb.</cite><br />

"Then did the sun on dunghill shine."&mdash;<cite>Ancient Pistol.</cite></p>


<p>It has often been remarked that it is impossible to play the enchanted
scenes of Bottom with any effect. In reading the poem we
idealize the ass-head; we can conceive that it represents in some
grotesque sort the various passions and emotions of its wearer; that it
assumes a character of dull jocosity, or duller sapience, in his conversations
with Titania and the fairies; and when calling for the assistance
of Messrs. Peas-blossom and Mustard-seed to scratch his head,
or of the Queen to procure him a peck of provender or a bottle of
hay, it expresses some puzzled wonder of the new sensations its
wearer must experience in tinglings never felt before, and cravings for
food until then unsuited to his appetite. But on the stage this is impossible.
As the manager cannot procure for his fairies representatives
of such tiny dimensions as to be in danger of being overflown
by the bursting of the honey-bag of an humble-bee, so it is impossible
that the art of the property-man can furnish Bottom with an ass-head
capable of expressing the mixed feelings of humanity and
asinity which actuate the metamorphosed weaver. It is but a pasteboard
head, and that is all. The jest is over the first moment after
his appearance; and, having laughed at it once, we cannot laugh at it
any more. As in the case of a man who, at a masquerade, has
chosen a character depending for its attraction merely on costume,&mdash;we
may admire a Don Quixote, if properly bedecked in Mambrino's
helmet and the other habiliments of the Knight of La Mancha, at a
first glance, but we think him scarcely worthy of a second.</p>

<p>So it is with the Bottom of the stage; the Bottom of the poem is
a different person. Shakspeare in many parts of his plays drops hints,
"vocal to the intelligent," that he feels the difficulty of bringing his
ideas adequately before the minds of theatrical spectators. In the
opening address of the Chorus of Henry V. he asks pardon for having
dared</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</div>
<div class="verse">So great an object. Can this cockpit hold</div>
<div class="verse">The vasty fields of France? or, may we cram</div>
<div class="verse">Within this wooden O, the very casques</div>
<div class="verse">That did affright the air at Agincourt?"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and requests his audience to piece out the imperfections of the theatre
with their thoughts. This is an apology for the ordinary and physical
defects of any stage,&mdash;especially an ill-furnished one; and it requires
no great straining of our imaginary forces to submit to them.
Even Ducrow himself, with appliances and means to boot a hundred-fold
more magnificent and copious than any that were at the command
of Shakspeare, does not deceive us into the belief that his
fifty horses, trained and managed with surpassing skill, and mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
by agile and practised riders, dressed in splendid and carefully-considered
costumes, are actually fighting the battle of Waterloo, but we
willingly lend ourselves to the delusion. In like manner, we may be
sure that in the days of Queen Elizabeth the audience of the Globe
complied with the advice of Chorus, and,</p>

<p class="linequot">"Minding true things by what their mockeries be,"</p>

<p>were contented that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Four or five most vile and ragged foils</div>
<div class="verse">Right ill-disposed, in brawl ridiculous,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>should serve to represent to their imagination the name of Agincourt.</p>

<p>We consent to this just as we do to Greeks and Romans speaking
English on the stage of London, or French on that of Paris; or to
men of any country speaking in verse at all; or to all the other demands
made upon our belief in playing. We can dispense with the
assistance of such downright matter-of-fact interpreters as those who
volunteer their services to assure us that the lion in Pyramus and
Thisbe is not a lion in good earnest, but merely Snug the joiner.
But there are difficulties of a more subtle and metaphysical kind to
be got over, and to these, too, Shakspeare not unfrequently alludes.
In the play before us,&mdash;Midsummer Night's Dream,&mdash;for example,
when Hippolita speaks scornfully of the tragedy in which Bottom
holds so conspicuous a part, Theseus answers, that the best of this
kind (scenic performances) are but shadows, and the worst no worse
if imagination amend them. She answers that it must be <em>your</em> imagination
then, not <em>theirs</em>. He retorts with a joke on the vanity of
actors, and the conversation is immediately changed. The meaning
of the Duke is, that, however we may laugh at the silliness of Bottom
and his companions in their ridiculous play, the author labours
under no more than the common calamity of dramatists. They
are all but dealers in shadowy representations of life; and if the worst
among them can set the mind of the spectator at work, he is equal
to the best. The answer to Theseus is, that none but the best, or,
at all events, those who approach to excellence, can call with success
upon imagination to invest their shadows with substance. Such
playwrights as Quince the carpenter,&mdash;and they abound in every
literature and every theatre,&mdash;draw our attention so much to the absurdity
of the performance actually going on before us, that we have
no inclination to trouble ourselves with considering what substance in
the background their shadows should have represented. Shakspeare
intended the remark as a compliment or a consolation to less successful
wooers of the comic or the tragic Muse, and touches briefly on
the matter; but it was also intended as an excuse for the want of
effect upon the stage of some of the finer touches of such dramatists
as himself, and an appeal to all true judges of poetry to bring it
before the tribunal of their own imagination; making but a matter of
secondary inquiry how it appears in a theatre, as delivered by those
who, whatever others may think of them, would, if taken at their own
estimation, "pass for excellent men." His own magnificent creation
of fairy land in the Athenian wood must have been in his mind, and
he asks an indulgent play of fancy not more for Oberon and Titania,
the glittering rulers of the elements, who meet</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"&mdash;&mdash; on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,</div>
<div class="verse">By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,</div>
<div class="verse">Or on the beached margent of the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">To dance their ringlets to the whistling wind,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>than for the shrewd and knavish Robin Goodfellow, the lord of practical
jokes, or the dull and conceited Bottom, "the shallowest thickskin
of the barren sort," rapt so wondrously from his loom and
shuttle, his threads and thrums, to be the favoured lover of the
Queen of Faëry, fresh from the spiced Indian air, and lulled with
dances and delight amid the fragrance of the sweetest flowers, filling
with their luscious perfume a moonlighted forest.</p>

<p>One part of Bottom's character is easily understood, and is often
well acted. Amid his own companions he is the cock of the walk.
His genius is admitted without hesitation. When he is lost in the
wood, Quince gives up the play as marred. There is no man in
Athens able to take the first part in tragedy but himself. Flute declares
that he has the best wit of any handicraftman in the city.
This does not satisfy the still warmer admirer,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> who insists on the
goodliness of his person, and the fineness of his voice. When it seems
hopeless that he should appear, the cause of the stage is given up as
utterly lost. When he returns, it is hailed as the "courageous day,"
and the "happy hour," which is to restore the legitimate drama. It is
no wonder that this perpetual flattery fills him with a most inordinate
opinion of his own powers. There is not a part in the play which
he cannot perform. As a lover, he promises to make the audience
weep; but his talent is still more shining in the Herculean vein of a
tyrant. The manliness of his countenance, he admits, incapacitates
him from acting the part of a heroine; but, give him a mask, and
he is sure to captivate by the soft melody of his voice. But, lest it
should be thought this melodious softness was alone his characteristic,
he claims the part of the lion, which he is to discharge with so
terrific a roar as to call forth the marked approbation of the warlike
Duke; and yet, when the danger is suggested of frightening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
ladies, who all, Amazons as they were, must be daunted by sounds
so fear-inspiring, he professes himself gifted with a power of compass
capable of imitating, even in the character of a roaring lion, the gentleness
of the sucking dove, or the sweetness of the nightingale. He
is equally fit for all parts, and in all parts calculated to outshine the
rest. This is allowed; but, as it is impossible that he can perform
them all, he is restricted to the principal. It is with the softest compliments
that he is induced to abandon the parts of Thisbe and the
lion for that of Pyramus. Quince assures him that he can play none
other, because "Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man as one
shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely, gentlemanlike man; <em>therefore</em>
YOU must undertake it." What man of woman born could resist flattery
so unsparingly administered? the well-puffed performer consents,
and though he knows nothing of the play, and is unable to tell whether
the part for which he is cast is that of a lover or a tyrant, undertakes
to discharge it with a calm and heroic indifference as to the colour of
the beard he is to wear, being confident, under any circumstances, of
success, whether that most important part of the costume be straw-coloured
or orange-tawny, French crown or purple in grain. With
equal confidence he gets through his performance. The wit of the
courtiers, or the presence of the Duke, have no effect upon his
nerves. He alone speaks to the audience in his own character, not
for a moment sinking the personal consequence of Bottom in the assumed
part of Pyramus. He sets Theseus right on a point of the
play with cool importance; and replies to the jest of Demetrius
(which he does not understand) with the self-command of ignorant
indifference. We may be sure that he was abundantly contented with
his appearance, and retired to drink in, with ear well deserving of the
promotion it had attained under the patronage of Robin Goodfellow,
the applause of his companions. It is true that Oberon designates
him as a "hateful fool;" that Puck stigmatizes him as the greatest
blockhead of the set; that the audience of wits and courtiers before
whom he has performed vote him to be an ass: but what matter is
that? He mixes not with them; he hears not their sarcasms; he
could not understand their criticisms; and, in the congenial company
of the crew of patches and base mechanicals who admire him, lives
happy in the fame of being <em>the</em> Nicholas Bottom, who, by consent, to
him universal and world-encompassing, is voted to be <em>the</em> Pyramus,&mdash;<em>the</em>
prop of the stage,&mdash;<em>the</em> sole support of the drama.</p>

<p>Self-conceit, as great and undisguised as that of poor Bottom, is to
be found in all classes and in all circles, and is especially pardonable
in what it is considered genteel or learned to call "the histrionic profession."
The triumphs of the player are evanescent. In no other
department of intellect, real or simulated, does the applause bestowed
upon the living artist bear so melancholy a disproportion to the repute
awaiting him after the generation passes which has witnessed
his exertions. According to the poet himself, the poor player</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</div>
<div class="verse">And then is heard no more."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Shakspeare's own rank as a performer was not high, and his reflections
on the business of an actor are in general splenetic and discontented.
He might have said,&mdash;though indeed it would not have fitted with the
mood of mind of the despairing tyrant into whose mouth the reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
is put,&mdash;that the well-graced actor, who leaves the scene not
merely after strutting and fretting, but after exhibiting power and
genius to the utmost degree at which his art can aim, amid the thundering
applause,&mdash;or, what is a deeper tribute, the breathless silence
of excited and agitated thousands,&mdash;is destined ere long to an oblivion
as undisturbed as that of his humbler fellow-artist, whose prattle
is without contradiction voted to be tedious. Kemble is fading fast
from our view. The gossip connected with every thing about Johnson
keeps Garrick before us, but the interest concerning him daily
becomes less and less. Of Betterton, Booth, Quin, we remember little
more than the names. The Lowins and Burbages of the days of
Shakspeare are known only to the dramatic antiquary, or the poring
commentator, anxious to preserve every scrap of information that may
bear upon the elucidation of a text, or aid towards the history of the
author. With the sense of this transitory fame before them, it is
only natural that players should grasp at as much as comes within
their reach while they have power of doing so. It would be a curious
speculation to inquire which personally has the greater enjoyment,&mdash;the
author, neglected in life, and working for immortal renown,
or the actor living among huzzas, and consigned to forgetfulness the
moment that his hour is past. I suppose, on the usual principle of
compensation, each finds in himself springs of happiness and self-comfort.
The dim distance, in its shadowy and limitless grandeur, fills
with solemn musings the soul of the one; the gorgeous gilding of the
sunny scenery in the foreground kindles with rapturous joy the heart
of the other. Shenstone lays it down as a principle, that, if it were
left to our choice whether all persons should speak ill of us to our
faces, and with applause behind our backs, or, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>, that the
applause should be lavished upon ourselves, and the ill-speaking kept
for our absence, we should choose the latter; because, if we never
heard the evil report, we should know nothing about our bad reputation,
while, on the contrary, the good opinion others entertained
of us would be of no avail if nothing reached our ears but words of
anger or reproach. Since, after all, it is from within, and not from
without, the sources of joy or sorrow bubble up, it does not matter
so very much as the sensitive Lord of Leasowes imagines what the
opinions of others concerning us may be,&mdash;at least as compared with
those which, right or wrong, we form of ourselves. The question is
of no great practical importance; and yet it would be somewhat
curious to speculate in the manner of Hamlet, if we could do so, on
the feelings of Kean and Wordsworth in the zenith of the popularity
of the former, when he was worshipped as a demi-god by the unquestionable,
or, at least, the scarce-questioned dispensers of daily renown;
while the other by the recognised oracles of critical sagacity
was set down as a jackass more obtuse than that belaboured by his
own Peter Bell.</p>

<p>Pardon, therefore, the wearers of the sock and buskin for being
obnoxious to such criticism as that lavished by Quince upon Bottom.
We have no traces left us of what constituted the ordinary puffery of
the Elizabethan days; but, as human nature is the same in all ages,
we must suppose the trade to have been in its own way as vigorously
carried on then as now. And, without hinting at anything personal,
do we not week after week find attached to every performer making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
(whether with justice or not is no part of the consideration) pretensions
to the omnifarious abilities of Bottom, some Peter Quince, who
sticks to that Bottom with the tenacity of a leech, and is ready to
swear that <em>he</em>, the Bottom, is the only man in Athens; that his appearance
spreads an universal joy; his occultation involves the world
in dramatical eclipse; that his performance of the lover can only be
surpassed by his performance of the tyrant; and that it must puzzle
an impartial public to decide whether nature and art, genius and
study, designed him for a heroine couchant, or a rampant lion. To
this it is little wonder that the object of applause lets down his ears
too often donkey-like, and permits himself to be scratched by a Master
Cobweb, spun though he be by a bottle-bellied spider, or a Master
Peas-blossom, who can only claim Mistress Squash for his mother
and Master Peascod for his father. In Peter Quince, Shakspeare
shadowed forth, by anticipation, Sheridan's Puff. Quince is a fool,
and Puff a rogue; and yet I think the criticism of the elder reviewer
just as valuable. It is in the end as useful to the object of applause
to be told, in plain terms, that he alone can act Pyramus because he
is a sweet-faced man, a proper man, a most lovely, gentlemanlike
man, as to have the same flummery administered under the guise of
mock philosophy, with gabbling intonations about breadth, profoundness,
depth, length, thickness, and so forth; which, being interpreted,
signify, in many cases, "I know nothing about acting or writing, but
I do know that you can give me a box or a dinner, and therefore let
me play to your Bottom, Quince the carpenter, in an ass's head, intended
as a representation of Aristotle the Stagirite."</p>

<p>Alas! I am wandering far away from the forest. I can only plead
that my guide has led me into my own congenial land of newspaper
from his native soil of poetry. But he never long remains out of
his own domain, and the jokes and jests upon the unlucky company
who undertook to perform</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus</div>
<div class="verse">And his love Thisbe, very tragical mirth,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>are but intrusive matter amid the romantic loves, all chivalrous and
a little classical, of Theseus and Hippolita, and the jealousies unearthly,
and yet so earthly, of Fairy Land. The romance of early
Greece was sometimes strangely confused by the romance of the middle
ages. It would take a long essay on the mixture of legends derived
from all ages and countries to account for the production of such a
personage as the "Duke ycleped Theseus" and his following; and the
fairy mythology of the most authentic superstitions would be ransacked
in vain to discover exact authorities for the Shakspearian
Oberon and Titania. But, no matter whence derived, the author
knew well that in his hands the chivalrous and classical, the airy
and the imaginative, were safe. It was necessary for his drama to introduce
among his fairy party a creature of earth's mould, and he has
so done it as in the midst of his mirth to convey a picturesque satire
on the fortune which governs the world, and upon those passions
which elsewhere he had with agitating pathos to depict. As Romeo,
the gentleman, is <em>the</em> unlucky man of Shakspeare, so here does he exhibit
Bottom, the blockhead, as <em>the</em> lucky man, as him on whom Fortune
showers her favours beyond measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the part of the character which cannot be performed. It
is here that the greatest talent of the actor must fail in answering
the demand made by the author upon our imagination. The utmost
lavish of poetry, not only of high conception, but of the most elaborate
working in the musical construction of the verse, and a somewhat
recondite searching after all the topics favourable to the display
of poetic eloquence in the ornamental style, is employed in the description
of the fairy scenes and those who dwell therein. Language
more brilliantly bejewelled with whatever tropes and figures rhetoricians
catalogue in their books is not to be found than what is scattered
forth with copious hand in Midsummer Night's Dream. The
compliment to Queen Elizabeth,</p>

<p class="linequot">"In maiden meditation fancy-free,"</p>

<p>was of necessity sugared with all the sweets that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-bon</i> box of
the poet could supply; but it is not more ornamented than the passages
all around. The pastoral images of Corin</p>

<p>and so on, are ostentatiously contrasted with misfortunes more metaphorically

<div class="verse">An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</div>
<div class="verse">Is, as in mockery, set."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The mermaid chaunting on the back of her dolphin; the fair vestal
throned in the west; the bank blowing with wild thyme, and decked
with oxlip and nodding violet; the roundelay of the fairies singing
their queen to sleep; and a hundred images beside of aërial grace
and mythic beauty, are showered upon us; and in the midst of these
splendours is tumbled in Bottom the weaver, blockhead by original
formation, and rendered doubly ridiculous by his partial change into
a literal jackass. He, the most unfitted for the scene of all conceivable
personages, makes his appearance, not as one to be expelled with
loathing and derision, but to be instantly accepted as the chosen lover
of the Queen of the Fairies. The gallant train of Theseus traverse
the forest, but they are not the objects of such fortune. The lady,
under the oppression of the glamour cast upon her eyes by the juice
of love-in-idleness, reserves her raptures for an absurd clown. Such
are the tricks of Fortune.</p>

<p>Oberon himself, angry as he is with the caprices of his queen, does
not anticipate any such object for her charmed affections. He is determined
that she is to be captivated by "some vile thing," but he
thinks only of</p>

<p>animals suggesting ideas of spite or terror; but he does not dream
that, under the superintendence of Puck, spirit of mischief, she is to
be enamoured of the head of an ass surmounting the body of a weaver.
It is so nevertheless; and the love of the lady is as desperate
as the deformity of her choice. He is an angel that wakes her from
her flowery bed; a gentle mortal, whose enchanting note wins her
ear, while his beauteous shape enthralls her eye; one who is as wise
as he is beautiful; one for whom all the magic treasures of the fairy
kingdom are to be with surpassing profusion dispensed. For him she
gathers whatever wealth and delicacies the Land of Faëry can boast.
Her most airy spirits are ordered to be kind and courteous to this
<em>gentleman</em>,&mdash;for into that impossible character has the blindness of
her love transmuted the clumsy and conceited clown. Apricocks and
dewberries, purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries, are to feed his
coarse palate; the thighs of bees, kindled at the eyes of fiery glowworms,
are to light him to his flower-decked bed; wings plucked from
painted butterflies are to fan the moonbeams from him as he sleeps;
and in the very desperation of her intoxicating passion she feels that
there is nothing which should not be yielded to the strange idol of
her soul. She mourns over the restraints which separate her from
the object of her burning affection, and thinks that the moon and the
flowers participate in her sorrow.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Abstracting the poetry, we see the same thing every day in the plain
prose of the world. Many is the Titania driven by some unintelligible
magic so to waste her love. Some juice, potent as that of Puck,&mdash;the
true Cupid of such errant passions,&mdash;often converts in the eyes
of woman the grossest defects into resistless charms. The lady of
youth and beauty will pass by the attractions best calculated to captivate
the opposite sex, to fling herself at the feet of age or ugliness.
Another, decked with graces, accomplishments, and the gifts of genius,
and full of all the sensibilities of refinement, will squander her
affections on some good-for-nothing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roué</i>, whose degraded habits and
pursuits banish him far away from the polished scenes which she
adorns. The lady of sixteen quarters will languish for him who has
no arms but those which nature has bestowed; from the midst of the
gilded <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i> a soft sigh may be directed towards the thin-clad tenant
of a garret; and the heiress of millions may wish them sunken in the
sea if they form a barrier between her and the penniless lad toiling
for his livelihood,</p>

<p>Fielding has told us all this in his own way, in a distich, (put, I believe,
into the mouth of Lord Grizzle; but, as I have not the illustrious
tragedy in which it appears, before me, I am not certain, and
must therefore leave it to my readers to verify this important point.)
Love</p>

<p class="linequot">"Lords into cellars bears,<br />
And bids the brawny porter walk up stairs."</p>

<p>Tom Thumb and Midsummer Night's Dream preach the one doctrine.
It would be amusing to trace the courses of thought by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the heterogeneous minds of Fielding and Shakspeare came to the
same conclusion.</p>

<p>Ill-mated loves are generally but of short duration on the side of
the nobler party, and she awakes to lament her folly. The fate of
those who suffer like Titania is the hardest. The man who is deprived
of external graces of appearance may have the power of captivating
by those of the mind: wit, polish, fame, may compensate for the
want of youth or personal attractions. In poverty or lowly birth may
be found all that may worthily inspire devoted affection&mdash;</p>

<p>In the very dunghill of dissipation and disgrace will be raked up occasionally
a lurking pearl or two of honourable feeling, or kind emotion,
or irregular talent, which may be dwelt upon by the fond eye,
wilfully averting its gaze from the miserable mass in which they are
buried. But woe unto the unhappy lady who, like Titania, is obliged
to confess, when the enchantment has passed by, that she was "enamoured
of an <em>ass</em>!" She must indeed "loathe his visage," and the
memory of all connected with him is destined ever to be attended by
a strong sensation of disgust.</p>

<p>But the ass himself of whom she was enamoured has not been the
less a favourite of Fortune, less happy and self-complacent, because of
her late repentance. He proceeds onward as luckily as ever. Bottom,
during the time that he attracts the attentions of Titania, never
for a moment thinks there is anything extraordinary in the matter.
He takes the love of the Queen of the Fairies as a thing of course,
orders about her tiny attendants as if they were so many apprentices
at his loom, and dwells in Fairy Land unobservant of its wonders, as
quietly as if he were still in his workshop. Great is the courage and
self-possession of an ass-head. Theseus would have bent in reverent
awe before Titania. Bottom treats her as carelessly as if she were
the wench of the next-door tapster. Even Christopher Sly,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> when
he finds himself transmuted into a lord, shows some signs of astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
He does not accommodate himself to surrounding circumstances.
The first order he gives is for a pot of small ale; and after
all the elegant luxuries of his new situation have been placed ostentatiously
before him,&mdash;after he has smelt sweet savours, and felt soft
things,&mdash;after he begins to think he is</p>

<p class="linequot">"A lord indeed,<br />
And not a tinker nor Christopher[o] Sly;"</p>

<p>even then nature&mdash;or habit, which stands in the place of nature,&mdash;recurs
invincible, and once more he calls for a pot of the smallest ale.
(I may again cite Fielding in illustration of Shakspeare; for do we
not read, in the Covent Garden tragedy, of the consolation that</p>

<p class="linequot">"Cold small beer is to the waking drunkard;"</p>

<p>and do we not hear the voice of Christopher Sly praying, for God's
sake, in the midst of his lordly honours, for a draught of that unlordly
but long-accustomed beverage?) In the Arabian Nights' Entertainments
a similar trick is played by the Caliph Haroun Al-raschid
upon Abou Hassan, and he submits, with much reluctance, to believe
himself the Commander of the Faithful. But having in vain sought
how to explain the enigma, he yields to the belief, and then performs
all the parts assigned to him, whether of business or pleasure, of counsel
or gallantry, with the easy self-possession of a practised gentleman.
Bottom has none of the scruples of the tinker of Burton-heath, or the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon vivant</i> of Bagdad. He sits down amid the fairies as one of themselves
without any astonishment; but so far from assuming, like
Abou Hassan, the manners of the court where he has been so
strangely intruded, he brings the language and bearing of the booth
into the glittering circle of Queen Titania. He would have behaved
in the same manner on the throne of the caliph, or in the bedizened
chamber of the lord; and the ass-head would have victoriously carried
him through.</p>

<p>Shakspeare has not taken the trouble of working out the conclusion
of the adventure of Sly; and the manner in which it is finished in
the old play where he found him, is trifling and common-place. The
Arabian novelist repeats the jest upon his hero, and concludes by
placing him as a favourite in the court of the amused caliph. This
is the natural ending of such an adventure; but, as Bottom's was supernatural,
it was to conclude differently. He is therefore dismissed
to his ordinary course of life, unaffected by what has passed. He
admits at first that it is wonderful, but soon thinks it is nothing more
than a fit subject for a ballad in honour of his own name. He falls
at once to his old habit of dictating, boasting, and swaggering, and
makes no reference to what has happened to him in the forest. It
was no more than an ordinary passage in his daily life. Fortune knew
where to bestow her favours.</p>

<p>Adieu then, Bottom the weaver! and long may you go onward
prospering in your course! But the prayer is needless, for you carry
about you the infallible talisman of the ass-head. You will be always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
be sure of finding a Queen of the Fairies to heap her favours upon you,
while to brighter eyes and nobler natures she remains invisible or
averse. Be you ever the chosen representative of the romantic and
the tender before dukes and princesses; and if the judicious laugh at
your efforts, despise them in return, setting down their criticism to
envy. This you have a right to do. Have they, with all their wisdom
and wit, captivated the heart of a Titania as you have done? Not
they&mdash;nor will they ever. Prosper therefore, with undoubting heart
despising the rabble of the wise. Go on your path rejoicing; assert
loudly your claim to fill every character in life; and you may be quite
sure that as long as the noble race of the Bottoms continues to exist,
the chances of extraordinary good luck will fall to their lot, while in
the ordinary course of life they will never be unattended by the
plausive criticism of a Peter Quince.</p>

<span class="f75">TALE (THE SECOND) OF ST. LUKE'S.</span></h2>


<p>"You must know, sir, that our family is of very distinguished origin.
My father was descended from the ancient L&mdash;&mdash;s, of L&mdash;&mdash; Hall,
in Leicestershire; my mother is from the sole remaining branch
of the renowned family of <em>Maxwell</em>;&mdash;of course you must remember,
sir, what great actions have been achieved by the <em>Maxwells</em> in olden
time?"</p>

<p>"My memory is not very good in such particulars," said I, to the
elegant young man with whom I was speaking; "pray proceed with
your narration, and never mind your ancestors."</p>

<p>"Not mind my ancestors!" returned L&mdash;&mdash;, a little angrily; "but
perhaps you are right, sir, after all; the <em>living</em> ought to claim our attention
more than the dead. Well! we were left in the deepest distress,&mdash;my
excellent mother, and myself, her only child. I will not trouble you
in detailing how my poor father, by a hundred improvident and extravagant
ways contrived to dwindle down his property; too proud to
embark in any profession except the army, and afterwards too poor to
enter it. He died of&mdash;of&mdash;a broken heart when I was about twelve years
old. I did nothing but devise schemes after this event to retrieve our
wretched circumstances when I became old enough. A thousand
plans, wild and visionary, passed through my brain; I could not sleep
at night for projects and inventions. I became fevered, restless, taciturn,
irritable, and absent. One day, when I had arrived at the age
of fifteen, on returning from a solitary walk, weary and exhausted,
with a lump of clayey substance, wrapped up carefully, in my hands,
which I had extracted from the side of a canal at a great distance from
my home, believing it to contain some most precious qualities which
might lead to my making a rapid fortune, I was forcibly struck with
the extreme dejection of my mother, and the want of all preparation
in our little parlour. I could not understand it at first; but the truth
came home slowly, heavily upon my heart. She had no longer the
means of procuring her son and herself another meal!" Here L&mdash;&mdash; paused,
and looked for sympathy.</p>

<p>"Did not the distress of your mother rouse you, L&mdash;&mdash;, into immediate
action?" said I.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied my companion, with an emphasis that made me
start; "would you have had a son of the ancient house of L&mdash;&mdash; go
and work upon the highway? to degrade himself with trade? or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely this had been better than seeing a mother starve, young gentleman,"
said I mildly; "but I interrupt you. Tell me what effect
was produced upon your mind by the knowledge of your situation.
What did you do?"</p>

<p>"You shall hear, sir, in due time," continued he gloomily; "but
I suppose the relation will cause you some displeasure. We cannot
always be masters of ourselves, or of our own actions."</p>

<p>"But we <em>ought</em> to be so, Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;; there is no slavery so bad as
the slavery of the passions. Then are we slaves indeed," and I looked
full upon him.</p>

<p>L&mdash;&mdash; resumed: "You shall know the exact truth, sir; I will at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
any rate be strictly impartial. When I was convinced that we had
not a meal left in the world,&mdash;convinced by remembering the bareness
of the walls, and now missing several articles of furniture that had
disappeared without my before perceiving it,&mdash;I seized my hat, and,
totally disregarding the pathetic appeal of my mother's voice,&mdash;the
beseeching accents of her who had never yet spoken to me a reproachful
word from my earliest recollections,&mdash;'to be calm, and
hope that better times would come,' I darted out of the house like
an arrow from the bow, and, coward as I was, after wandering about
for hours to summon resolution for the act, rushed to the river
about a mile from the village, and threw myself into its rapid current.
There I soon lost all recollection of myself and my misery.
The last sound I heard was the gurgling of waters in my ears and
throat; the last sensation I experienced was that I should not now
die the languishing death of famine. My mother's image was before
me; then it grew indistinct, and all was darkness, vagueness, insensibility."
L&mdash;&mdash; again paused.</p>

<p>"Then you have actually committed the crime of suicide, young
man!" I exclaimed reproachfully; "I trust you have been repentant
for it. Your intention was to destroy yourself; the motive makes the
crime."</p>

<p>"My narrative, sir, is of events, not of my own feelings," replied
Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; proudly; "if you are already disgusted with my conduct
as a boy, perhaps it might be better that you knew not of it as a man.
Perhaps I had better stop here?"</p>

<p>"That is according to your own pleasure, my dear sir," said I, affecting
an indifference that I did not feel; but wishing to curb the
irritability of my young companion.</p>

<p>"Most strange were my emotions," continued he, after a pause and
a smile, "on life returning to my bosom,&mdash;that is active life; for I
suppose the principle itself was not absolutely extinct. What is
your opinion, sir, as a medical man? Can life be rekindled in the
human breast when once fairly extinguished? for my part I think it
can, and that mine is a renewed life. You smile, sir, but I should
wish an answer to my question;" and again that proud, yet beautiful,
lip of his, curled with impatience, whilst he took a stride across the
apartment.</p>

<p>"Can life ever be extinguished?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, looking at me as if he thought I
was insane, or jesting with him. "Are we not living in one great hospital,
amidst the dying and the dead? Are we sure of our existence
a single hour? Must we not all die at last?"</p>

<p>"Let each one speak for himself, Falkner L&mdash;&mdash;," said I impressively;
"I am sure of the perpetuity of mine own existence; it can
never perish."</p>

<p>"Oh! <em>that</em> is your meaning, is it?" sarcastically exclaimed my opponent.
"I am no divine, and my question related to that existence I
know of. I wished to learn whether I have been absolutely dead?
since, if so, I can account better for many of those thoughts and
sensations that now puzzle and perplex me exceedingly. But I
will not press my inquiry further on you; perhaps you know as little
about these things as myself;" and he pressed his hand upon his
forehead, whilst a sigh he sought to restrain would be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go on with your story, L&mdash;&mdash;," said I; "we will discuss this subject
about existence and a future state another time; what were
your sensations on recovering the use of your senses? for you must
have been brought to life, I conclude, somehow or other."</p>

<p>"I found myself lying on the grass," continued Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, "quite
wet, but with an agreeable warmth within, from some cordial that
had been administered to me. I gazed at first, unconsciously,
upon the clouds sailing by upon the blue ocean of immensity above
my head. I felt myself calm and composed as that depth of sky,
fathomless, unsearchable,&mdash;for memory was not yet awakened in me,&mdash;and
<em>the present</em> was to me peaceful, holy. Oh, that such moments
should be lost! I thought the moon some new and beautiful appearance
just rising from creation. I was roused into recollection thus:</p>

<p>"'Are you able, young man, now to walk?' said a hoarse unpleasing
voice near me; 'your mother, perchance, is uneasy at your absence;
and she should be spared from the bitter knowledge that her only,
her beloved son, intended to have deserted her in her moment of deep
affliction. Hide this from her; it will be a pious secret. Conceal
your intention of self-destruction from her.'</p>

<p>"During the whole of this speech my entire being seemed to be undergoing
a change, rapid and powerful. I awakened as from a trance.
I felt the enormity of my past conduct. My mother's tenderness!
her uncomplaining sufferings! the sacrifices she had made to procure
me the necessaries of life! her total absence of all selfishness! her
privations! her patience! all rose before me. And how had I requited
her?&mdash;by base desertion, by cruel ingratitude! My heart was
softened, and, boy-like, I burst into tears.</p>

<p>"'Showers should produce blossoms,&mdash;blossoms fruit!' said the
same croaking discordant voice close to my ear. '<em>Tears</em> are showers
for good resolutions; they should not be unproductive. Your mother,
young man! think of your mother!'</p>

<p>"I started upon my feet, and was going hastily home, when it
struck me that this man must have plucked me out of the water;
so I turned to thank him. I had not yet set my eyes upon him. A
short, squabby figure met my gaze, with a head of extraordinary
size, round which hung dark elfish locks; his eyes were immensely
large, and had a most melancholy expression, yet they were strongly
tinctured with benevolence, and had a most searching quality,&mdash;something
that seemed not of this earth. My reason still tottered on
its throne: the delusion again darted across my mind that I was
not in the same state of existence as formerly, and that this strange-looking
being was one of the inhabitants of the new one, in which
I found myself. I looked at him again curiously, inquiringly; and
found that, in addition to his uncouth globular form, enormous head,
and eyes with bushy brows, he had an excrescence on his shoulder
known commonly by the name of '<em>a hump</em>,' and had one short, distorted
<em>club-foot</em>!"</p>

<p>As Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; told me this, he turned unusually pale, and a
cold shudder passed like a blighting wind over him. I knew he had
been subject to all sorts of fancies and wild conjectures, the offspring
of a heated imagination; so I only coolly observed,</p>

<p>"Oh! your preserver, then, it seems, was a poor hunchback! I
wonder how he fished you out of the river?&mdash;how he had the
strength to do it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; answered me only with a most mysterious look, and
another shudder. I took out my watch, and struck the hour; it
had the desired effect, for he was sensitive in the highest degree.</p>

<p>"I will not detain you long," said he, in a deprecating tone,
"your time is precious;" and thus he continued:&mdash;"I stammered
out my thanks for the service he had done me; but my knees
knocked against each other, and my teeth chattered in my head. I
was on the point of falling."</p>

<p>"'You have caught a severe cold, I suppose,' exclaimed the man
with the club-foot; 'but it might have been worse. Here, take
another draught of this cordial, which has been the means already
of doing you some service. Hesitate not; you will find instant relief;
I composed it myself in the island of Ceylon, from the rarest
spices, and have often proved its efficacy.' He approached me; he
only reached my waist; and, what was most strange, I heard not the
slightest sound as he moved his feet! Feet!&mdash;shall I call them <em>feet</em>?&mdash;he
had but one; the other resembled the gnarled, disproportioned
fragment of the root of an old oak-tree; it had a sort of cradle, on
which it rested; it was tipped with brass, and of expensive workmanship.
I could draw you the exact pattern of this shoe."</p>

<p>"What matters the shape of a deformed man's shoe?" said I; "a
little larger, or a little smaller, makes all the difference, I suppose,
between them. They are very expert in manufacturing these <em>helps</em>
in Germany; we cannot approach them in such things. There is a
man now at Hambro', who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This shoe was never made in Germany!" interrupted Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;,
with a deep sepulchral tone of voice; and again he shuddered, whilst
a spasm shook his frame.</p>

<p>"Very likely not," said I, with a tone of perfect nonchalance;
"perhaps it was one of Sheldrake's shoes; but it is of little consequence:&mdash;you
and I will never want one of such construction; that
is one comfort, however."</p>

<p>"No," he replied musingly, "not for ourselves: but in my family
perchance it may be wanted. Tell me, sir, are these deformities hereditary?"
and his eyes seemed to penetrate my inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>"Did you mean the <em>shoe</em> or the <em>foot</em>, L&mdash;&mdash;?" I asked jestingly;
"one is as likely as the other; but shall we never get beyond or
above this piece of leather, or prunella? I declare we have been
standing in this man's shoes half an hour at least; they pinch me to
death."</p>

<p>"I would not stand in that man's shoes for a single moment, to gain
an entire world!" impressively pronounced poor L&mdash;&mdash;, casting up
his eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>"Yet," said I, "one of them might fit you better than the other;
for I suppose that brass-bitted piece of machinery must be rather uncomfortable
to walk with. It would make, too, such a devil of a
noise!" and I again had recourse to my watch.</p>

<p>"It made no noise at all, I tell you!" vehemently cried out poor
Falkner L&mdash;&mdash;; "no satin slipper of a lady ever trod so silently.
A rose-leaf dropping on the ground might have made a louder sound;
but you do not credit me."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" cried I; "the water was still in your ears; that was
the reason you could not hear the clatter of the mailed shoe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has the water been in my ears these ten&mdash;nay, more,&mdash;eleven
summers and winters since, nights and days?" inquired my companion
petulantly. "No one can, no one will, understand me,&mdash;nay, I
scarce can comprehend myself. That accursed cordial that he gave
me!"</p>

<p>"I should like to have a glass of it this moment, for I feel much
exhausted," said I.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I ought to have thought of it myself;" and
he rang the bell for a tray and wine. We partook of some potted
meats. I drank a couple of glasses of Madeira, my friend one of
water; the tray was removed, and I took up my hat.</p>

<p>"Will you not hear me to the end?" inquired L&mdash;&mdash;, fixing his
dejected eyes upon me with an expression so appealing, so touching,
that I could not resist them.</p>

<p>"When will that <em>end</em> arrive?" said I, playfully. "Did you drink the
cordial that this little rotundity offered to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I drained it to the bottom. So very delicious was its taste,
so grateful to my exhausted frame and spirits, that I left not a drop
in the globular vessel that contained it. I returned to him the flask."</p>

<p>"'Thou art not yet cured of <em>thy selfishness</em>, young man,' said the
man with the club-foot, in a severe tone which made his voice appear
more harsh and grating even than before. 'Couldst thou not
have spared a single drop out of that vessel for the next intended suicide
I may chance to meet with? Fortunately I have been more
provident than thou hast been considerate; I have not exhausted my
whole mine of wealth upon thee. Thy mother, boy, has spoiled thy
nature, I see, by indulgence. Go, and think of others as well as of
thyself.' With this, the strange being I had been speaking with,
shaking his coarse and wiry locks at me, trundled himself away,&mdash;for
walking it did not seem; and I again perceived <em>that not the slightest
sound came from his steps</em>!"</p>

<p>"On entering my mother's small but neat abode, she threw her
arms around my neck, and wept for joy at seeing me.</p>

<p>"'My beloved Falkner! I am so glad you are returned! I have
such delightful news to tell you;&mdash;but you are wet, pale, hungry
too I doubt not; but that shall not be for long. I have plenty of
every thing good in the house; food of every description, and ready
for eating, too,&mdash;so we will begin: but change your clothes first, Falkner.
Why, my dear, dear boy, you must have tumbled into the
river,&mdash;perhaps in trying to catch fish for your mother's supper;&mdash;but
we do not want fish now.'</p>

<p>"After changing my wet apparel for the only other suit I had, and
that none of the best, we sat down opposite to each other at the
clean-scowered deal table,&mdash;the others had been parted with previously.
We had no cloth,&mdash;they too had disappeared one by one
long before; but hunger is not over fastidious. A cold fowl was
placed upon the table: a tongue, and a bottle of wine, with plenty of
fine wheaten bread, cheese, and butter. The word '<em>selfishness</em>' rung
in my ears during dinner; I was resolved to pluck this abominable
vice from my bosom even to the very roots. When we had ate and
were filled, I began to question my mother how she had been able
to procure these dainties.</p>

<p>"'They were sent from the tavern, Falkner, by a <em>very old friend</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
of mine,&mdash;one I have not seen for many, many years. He has taken
our spare apartments at a price twenty times beyond their value, and
has given me a month's rent in advance. He is gone now to order
in furniture from C&mdash;&mdash; both for himself and us. We shall never
know want again! My darling son will now be provided for, according
to his birth;' and my mother shed tears of joy.</p>

<p>"All this appeared to me exceedingly strange; but, then, it was
delightful also. I complained, however, very soon of fatigue, when
my tender mother insisted on having my bed warmed, on account of
my '<em>tumble into the water</em>;' and, bringing me a glass of mulled spiced
wine, she kissed my forehead, and departed.</p>

<p>"I did not wake till noon. What a change had been effected
ere that time, in our white-washed cottage! New handsome carpets
were spread over the floors; chairs and tables placed in perfect order
against the walls, and of the best quality. Room was left on one side
our parlour for a grand piano, which my mother's friend would
procure for her use from London. He had already ransacked a considerable
market-town near us, and had contrived to get together tolerable
things, but not of the quality he wished: he had gone now to
London for the purpose of purchasing the piano, and many other luxuries
he thought she needed; but would return in the course of a
week, and take up his abode as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'And who is this friend of yours, my dear mother?' I inquired.
'You say you have known him long. Why has he not sooner attended
to your wants?'</p>

<p>"'For a simple reason, Falkner,' she replied; 'he knew not of
them; he is but just arrived in England.'</p>

<p>"'Is he a <em>relation</em>, mother? I trust he is, and a very near one too,
or&mdash;&mdash;' and I hesitated. 'I am but a young adviser, yet I feel that
a female,&mdash;a handsome one, too,&mdash;a descendant from the proud family
of the Maxwells, ought not to be obliged to any one who is
an alien in blood and name. I cannot suffer <em>my</em> mother to be degraded.
We may perish, but we will not be disgraced.'</p>

<p>"My mother heard me patiently to the end; then, smiling sweetly
on me, told me she admired me for my delicacy of feeling and regard
for her honour, but that I need be under no apprehension on her account,
as her dear and valued old friend was her very nearest relative;
also, 'We are sisters' children, Falkner, and in childhood were
most intimate. You should hear him on the organ, Falkner; he
would rival St. Cecilia herself on that celestial instrument. He
wishes now to know in what way he can benefit my son? Have
you ever thought of a profession?'</p>

<p>"'Thought of one! Oh, mother! Have I thought of anything
else? Who can look at those bright orbs moving above us without
longing to be acquainted with their relative positions, their bearings
on each other. Let me be an astronomer, I conjure you, but let
me not learn of any common master; let me understand the wonders
of magnetic and electrical influence, the causes of universal gravitation;
whether the infinite expanse above and around me be an entire
void&mdash;a vacuum, or full of invisible ether, from which matter is
formed the subtle essence which, when called together by its Maker's
voice, thickens and hardens into worlds like this I tread on.'</p>

<p>"I was now mounted on the hobby that had for the last three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
years&mdash;nay, more, from my very infancy,&mdash;carried me on its back,
enjoying my day-dreams, and bearing me oft into dark labyrinths of
abstruse speculations. This was the first time I had ever ventured
to mount it, except in privacy; for there is a secret delight in keeping
these same ambling nags, you know, from the sight of others.
They are ready at all hours during the day, as well as night, saddled
and bridled for our use."</p>

<p>"And so is my Bucephalus, Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;," said I, interrupting him.
"I dare say the poor beast is wondering what his master is about
this length of time."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; I am a long time telling my story," said my
companion; "but I wished to show you how very soon the favourite
occupation of my mind, indulging in vain abstractions, put to flight
all my prudence, my high sense of honour, and delicacy to my mother's
fame. To have my ardent wishes gratified with regard to my
studies made me forget that perhaps it might be improper to purchase
them at such expense; but my <em>selfishness</em> was not wholly departed
from me.</p>

<p>"My mother seemed perfectly astonished at hearing what was my
desire for the future; but she wrote off that night to consult 'her friend,'
whose answer was most propitious. 'He knew a very learned man
in Germany, who could instruct me in all these matters, a Dr. Hettmann,
a great philosopher and astronomer,&mdash;something, too, of an astrologer
to boot,&mdash;who was certain to receive as a pupil any relative
of Mr. Maxwell's; and, as for the means, he begged my mother not
to consider about those, but to prepare my equipment, and he would
himself take me over to the doctor, by way of Rotterdam, to Vienna,
and settle every arrangement on my account.' And so the preparations
were begun immediately.</p>

<p>"With that inconsistency with which very young men generally act
and think, it struck me forcibly that I could not, ought not, to leave
my mother thus domesticated in the same house even with her near
relation, and I absent; so, with a very high air of importance, conceit,
as well as temper, I told her, 'I should <em>not</em> go to Germany after
all, for I should have enough to do to protect her against the evil
designs of this accursed relative of hers, who I wished heartily was
at the bottom of the Black Sea&mdash;the Red one was too good for him.'</p>

<p>"'Do not alarm yourself, my dear Falkner,' said she meekly, and
confusedly casting down her eyes; 'there shall be no impropriety on
my part. You shall never have cause to blush for your mother. The
morning previous to your setting off under the escort of my friend, I
intend giving him my hand at C&mdash;&mdash; church, and trust you will be
present at our nuptials.'</p>

<p>"I have no doubt, sir, I jumped from my chair a foot and a half at
hearing this proposition," said L&mdash;&mdash;. "I asked her if I had heard
aright? and felt that my lips quivered with emotion, and that a cold
damp was on my brow.</p>

<p>"'It is a long story, Falkner,' said my mother, 'and I have not
the heart to enter into it now; suffice it to say I was engaged to my
cousin, Mr. Maxwell, before I saw your father: <em>after</em> I had seen him,
I could not fulfil my prior engagement. With a generosity I could
not copy, I was relieved from it by him, and he went abroad. But
now, though late, I shall do my best to make my first affianced <em>lover</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
happy.' '<em>Lover!</em>' thought I. From my very soul I detested this
abominable Mr. Maxwell. Once or twice I contemplated shooting him,
as a kind of rival; at any rate to interpose my authority&mdash;to interdict
the ceremony, to me so loathsome; but then again I thought of our
former poverty, our threatened starvation, of my wretched prospects
without the aid of this odious father-in-law. In the end, after a fearful
tempest in my mind, and then a fit of gloom and ill-humour, I moodily
made up my mind <em>not</em> to prevent my mother's marriage with her
cousin; especially as a box of Dollond's best mathematical instruments,
with a quadrant and telescope, were sent down to me as a
present from this hated Mr. Maxwell. 'I will endeavour to behave decently
when he arrives, and give her to him, if I can, at the altar,'
thought I.</p>

<p>"Two days after, a plain travelling-carriage stopped at our garden
gate; my heart beat wildly&mdash;I looked at my mother; she was calm and
pale as usual, but her eyes were anxiously, deprecatingly, cast on me.
I understood the appealing glances that came from them. 'Mother,'
said I, 'fear not; I will behave magnificently!&mdash;you shall see how well I
will treat him.' I heard the carriage-door slap to; I expected to hear
the footsteps of the ardent, thriving bridegroom coming up the little
gravel-walk leading from the gate to the parlour; but all was quiet.
'Shall I go to meet him?' I inquired in the plenitude of my intended
patronage. There was no need; <em>the intended bridegroom stood before
me</em>,&mdash;the man to whom I was to give away my tender, my beloved,
my beautiful mother. There, in all his native deformity, with his
large head, enormous eyes, and dark elf looks, stood <em>the man with
the club-foot</em>!</p>

<p>"I will tell you the rest of my story another time&mdash;not now&mdash;not
now!" and Falkner L&mdash;&mdash; rushed from the apartment. I left the
house immediately.</p>

<p>As I rode home to my own house, half a dozen miles distant, I pondered
upon the narrative I had just heard. "Perchance," thought I,
"the root of this malady is left; it may grow again. I fear he is not
quite recovered. I will see him at any rate to-morrow."</p>

<p>L&mdash;&mdash; fully expected me, and smiled as I entered; but he looked
paler than usual, and his hand was feverish. I spoke cheerfully to
him; told him some little gossip I had picked up by the way; read
him a paragraph or two from a London paper&mdash;the crack article of
the day; descanted on the weather, as all Englishmen do, and prophesied
respecting it for the next four-and-twenty hours. It was his
turn next. After a moment's silence, and a sort of struggle with his
feelings, he took up the thread of his discourse, but not where he
had left off.</p>

<p>"You must have perceived, sir," began my young friend, "that I
am of a wayward temper, and have been spoiled by overweening indulgence.
My father&mdash;but he is in the grave; let me not disturb
his ashes more than necessary;&mdash;I told you he had died of a broken
heart. I am ashamed of the prevarication; his heart certainly was
broken, but <em>his own hand</em> assisted the slower operations of nature.
He would not brook delay; so ran a sword into that princely organ,
and made it stop."</p>

<p>So fearfully pale now looked poor Falkner, that I handed him a
glass of wine standing ready on the table, and made him drink it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
saying in as cheerful a tone as I could muster up, "Come, come, my
dear L&mdash;&mdash;, you have begun now at quite a different part of your
story; we must not retrograde. I want to know what you said or did
to this same extraordinary-looking being who wanted to be your
father-in-law,&mdash;this <em>man with the club-foot</em>; what did you say to
him?"</p>

<p>"Astonishment chained up my tongue," answered L&mdash;&mdash;, "and
disgust to his person turned me sick. On the other hand, gratitude
whispered to me that he had saved my life: and self-interest suggested
that without his aid, however revolting his person might be, there
was nothing left to us but penury and wretchedness. Suspended as
between two attractive powers did I stand, my eyes wildly gazing on
him, and my brain actually whirling amidst these conflicting emotions."</p>

<p>"'Falkner,' said my mother, 'speak to me!&mdash;you alarm me
greatly! Why do you look as if you saw a spirit? Randolph, has
my son ever beheld you before this moment, for there is recognition
in his gaze? He was an infant only when you saved his life thirteen
years ago.' 'He has seen me only for two minutes,' croaked out that
same harsh unmusical voice: 'he fell by some chance into the millstream
the other day, and I helped him out again. To judge by his
looks, he would not have done the same thing by me, if I had given
him the same chance;' and the monster laughed.</p>

<p>"I roused myself at length from the spell that bound me. 'Mother,'
cried I vehemently, 'I must speak to you alone;' the man
with the club-foot moved instantly and silently from the apartment.</p>

<p>"'This cannot be,' I exclaimed passionately, 'that you can call
this hideous wretch your husband! Nature herself must shudder only
at the thought. Deformed, stunted, odious, revolting!&mdash;Mother, the
very touch of his hand would be a profanation to the dead. My mother
sighed. 'And yet, Falkner, how much happier should I have
been had I not been dazzled from my plighted faith by exterior advantages
alone, and passed my life with one whose qualities are like
the fairest diamond placed in a rude shagreen casket. My son, you
have not yet looked upon the brilliancy <em>within</em>. Read that paper,
Falkner, and be just.' My mother quitted the room as she spoke.</p>

<p>"For the first time in my life I perceived a counteracting influence
in opposition to my own in the breast of my tender mother, and the
thought enraged me beyond all bounds. Again I meditated self-destruction;
again gloomily conceived the thought that I would immolate
this intruding wretch, and thus free us both from his persevering
attentions. 'It shall be done,' I exclaimed aloud, clenching my
hands together in a delirium of passion; 'I have learned a few secrets
from Nature in my wanderings alone with her, and one of them I will
prove this very evening on&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'<em>Your benefactor, Falkner!</em>' interrupted the raven-like croaking
of Randolph Maxwell, looking up into my face with those large melancholy
eyes of his, and laying his hand on mine. I was taken unawares,
and was surprised to find that this same hand of his was delicately
white, and soft as that of a woman's. It had on a ring of
surpassing brilliancy, which attracted my eyes even in the midst of
this exciting scene, so boyish and unfixed at that time was my mind.
Was it that the ring itself possessed some powerful spell over my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
wayward thoughts? or that the hand, looking like a <em>human one</em>,&mdash;nay,
even beautiful in its kind,&mdash;made the owner of it appear at that moment
like a being of the same nature as my own? By an impulse
I could not control, I extended my own towards him, and I
fancied I saw a moisture in those large melancholy eyes of his.
'Emma, my betrothed Emma,' called out that voice, made only for the
society of crocodiles and croaking birds of prey, 'come hither, Emma,
and behold thy Randolph and thy son <em>friends</em>.' She entered at the
call, and pressed our united hands between her own. Then all the
loathing and abhorrence of my nature against that inexplicable being
returned, and with as much violence as before. But I covered it
over with artifice, cloaked it with politeness, obscured it from observation
by taciturnity and sullenness. Like a martyr I submitted to
my fate; so, the next morning I accompanied this ill-matched pair to
the church of C&mdash;&mdash;, and saw them married, forcing myself to give
away my almost idolised parent to a thing resembling an ourang-outang.
How did I long to spurn the reptile I looked down upon,
with my foot! to crush him to pieces as I would a bloated toad!</p>

<p>"That very evening my new father-in-law and myself set off to
Germany, my mother having previously put into my hands once more,
that paper she had before wished me to read. I thrust it into my
pocket. Her blessing to us both, as we seated ourselves in the carriage
of the dwarf, still rings in my ears.</p>

<p>"'Farewell, dear Randolph! Farewell, beloved son! For my sake,
Randolph, be kind to this <em>unfortunate</em> boy!' Thus did the dwarf
answer: 'I swear to you by that faith which has been so powerfully
proved, to be careful and indulgent to your son. Write to me,
my&mdash;&mdash;' he would have added '<em>beloved wife</em>;' but catching, I suppose,
some strange and threatening expression in my eyes, he changed it
into 'my dear and earliest friend!' I felt choking, but would not
give way to the tenderness of nature;&mdash;I would not say, 'God bless
you, best and kindest of mothers!' I threw myself back into the
carriage, and, overpowered with various emotions, I wept like an
infant. But be it remembered, sir, I was not then sixteen years old.
At length a healing slumber closed up my senses. I know not how
long it lasted, for when I awoke I was alone; the carriage was standing
without horses in an inn-yard; my companion would not have me
disturbed, and was gone himself into the house to give orders for our
accommodation there that night.</p>

<p>"My mother had used a word in parting that became to me as a
constant goad; nay, it entered into my very soul. '<em>Her unfortunate
boy!</em>' Why should she use the word <em>unfortunate</em>? I had been told
from infancy, (and I firmly believed what had been so often asserted,)
that I was eminently handsome. Both my parents had been distinguished
for their great personal attractions, and I had been assured
that I possessed in a still higher degree than they did the exterior gifts
and graces of nature. Then, as to mental ones, had I not been born
a poet, philosopher, everything that was great and noble?&mdash;for so my
doting parents always said in my hearing. Why then did she now
call me <em>unfortunate</em>, especially when she had provided for me so august
a patron in her second husband? I have since fully known what she
meant by this term <em>unfortunate</em>."</p>

<p>Poor L&mdash;&mdash; at this time rose from his chair, and gazed up vacantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
into the clouds. I knew what he was thinking of, but the subject
was too delicate for me to touch on.</p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<p>"I forgot the paper I had thrust into my pocket when I left my
mother. We travelled on together wrapt up each in our own
thoughts, for I could not force myself to converse with him, although
sometimes I was astonished at the depth and genius of his observations.
They fell like brilliant gems around me, but I would not pick
them up, or even admire their lustre. At length wearied, I suppose,
with my obstinacy, he took a book out of the pocket of the carriage,
and began to read. This I considered an indignity, an insult, and
with marks of temper sought immediately for another. In this mood
we reached the house of the celebrated <em>Scheele</em>, in Vienna, where it
was agreed I should for some months reside, that I might learn
something of chemistry before I began my astronomical researches.</p>

<p>"Not a word was said to me on money matters; all this was arranged
without my knowledge. I found a pocket-book on my toilet,
containing most ample means for my private expenses, but it was unaccompanied
with a single line. No leave was taken of me; but
when I arose one morning I was told by the family of the Professor
Scheele that 'my friend' had departed at an early hour, leaving
me in charge of them, bespeaking their kindest attentions for me,
and paying most liberally for me in advance.</p>

<p>"'Tis <em>all beyond</em> my comprehension," said Falkner L&mdash;&mdash; after a
pause, and repeating to himself that line of Milton,</p>

<p class="linequot">"And found no end, in wandering mazes lost."</p>

<p class="no-indent">Then abruptly he continued thus:</p>

<p>"I learned all sorts of splendid nonsense from Professor Scheele,
for I know not its utility. I went from him to the renowned Berzelius,
and laid in a stock of more. I studied astronomy under a
relation of the famous Schiller, and alchemy from a nephew of Jang
Stilling. But what availed all these acquisitions? One fixed idea
was ever like an incubus upon my soul,&mdash;the thought of my mother's
marriage with this club-footed hunchback. Years passed on; and
though invited, implored, to return to England, yet I could not endure
the thought of seeing her <em>the wife</em> of so distorted a little wretch.
She wrote to me ever 'of his nobleness, his generosity:' I felt the
latter in the plenitude of his allowance to her son; but I was haunted
perpetually by his image, hovering like an imp of darkness over a
form moulded by the Graces. I hated my own country because it
contained him, and yet I could think of nothing else. I became melancholy,
morose, obstinate, taciturn, irritable to excess.</p>

<p>"One day, in clearing out my writing-desk, a paper came into my
hand that I had no recollection of; it turned out to be the very one
my mother had put into my hands just before my departure. These
were the words. It was a letter from 'the Man with the club-foot'
to herself.</p>

<p>"'To Emma, the beloved of my heart,&mdash;Think you that I am blind
to my own imperfections?&mdash;that I am fool enough to suppose that
this warped and twisted person of mine is a thing to be beloved, to
be caressed? I have been conscious of my own deformities from a
very child; and then it was that you, many years my junior, and accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
to the sight of my exterior hideousness from your birth,
cared not for it, but gave me the blessing of your companionship, and
taught me to hope you could endure my presence through life. So
did I delude myself; so did you guilelessly assist me in the delusion.
I believed I should call you my own; you sanctioned this belief.
But when the fascinating L&mdash;&mdash; arrived, how soon did I perceive my
fatal mistake! I saw it long before my Emma even suspected it,
and&mdash;why should I pain you now by telling you what I then suffered?
enough, you know how I acted;&mdash;the hunchback preferred your
happiness to his own.</p>

<p>"'Emma, it is unnecessary now to tell you how I employed myself
during seventeen years, and how much I thought of those days when
my beautiful cousin would gaze fondly in my eyes, and call me 'her
dear Randolph!' Need I say what unexpected delight I experienced
when once I was enabled to save her child, then a very cherub, and
still beautiful as herself, from destruction? You know all this; and
how, after this transaction, blessed with her gratitude, I departed for
Ceylon. Was I not loaded also with the knowledge and the misery
that she, my beloved one, was not happy? I could not stay to witness
her regrets.</p>

<p>"'I went to Ceylon. It was with a miser's feeling that I hoarded
up riches in that island, which contains more riches than any other
part of the world. I trafficked in diamonds; I tried experiments
with spices; I found hidden treasure; and, as I amassed wealth almost
beyond calculation, I constantly said to myself, 'All this is for
her,&mdash;<em>she will need it</em>.'</p>

<p>"'And is it not thine own, thou idol of my heart?&mdash;and is it not
thy darling son's? But think not that Randolph Maxwell's love is
tainted by vile selfishness. I know, I feel my <em>person</em> must be abhorrent
to my lovely cousin now&mdash;it is not like her L&mdash;&mdash;'s; my mind
she has some knowledge of. Let our marriage, then, beloved one!
be only of the mind; let me live with you, gaze on you, hope that I
disgust you not, and you will make your faithful cousin happy. I
ask no more. Your child is mine; I have no other; he is the heir
of my possessions, and herewith I make over to him and you, wealth
enough to satisfy the most craving of our species;&mdash;everything, except
a small pittance in case you should wish my absence, is yours.
And now, Emma, we understand each other, and I think we ever
shall. If your son&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"But here the paper was skilfully divided; my mother would not
suffer me to know the opinion Randolph Maxwell had of her wayward
Falkner. Oh! that I had read this letter before!&mdash;it would have
saved me hundreds of hours of anguish; but, now that I had done so,
I formed an instant resolution of returning to England and my mother.
Having always the means by me, I put no curb to my inclinations;
I never had done so in my life, and, to my mother's astonishment,
arrived there without informing her she might expect me.
Enchantment seemed to have been used, for a palace had risen up close
to our former white-washed cottage. I forgot my mother had apprised
me. By an expensive process, full-grown trees of every kind had
been transplanted to the new abode; it was imbedded in the midst of
costly firs and flowering shrubs. I flew to her and tenderly embraced
her. I even inquired respectfully for <em>the man with the club-foot</em>. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
began myself to honour him. My mother's countenance changed as I
mentioned his name, and an unknown kind of dread came over me.
'Let me know the worst at once,' said I, 'for,'&mdash;in short, I thought
then, as now, that he had more than mortal agency.</p>

<p>"'<em>The worst</em> will soon be told you, Falkner,' said my mother
sadly. 'My cousin Randolph is dying: he has been in a declining
state for the last two years. He eats nothing, never sleeps, and I
shall soon lose a being of such exemplary worth, that I fear it will
break my heart. It is impossible to describe to you the nobleness,
the disinterested attachment of this creature, now at the very point
of death. But here comes Dr. E&mdash;&mdash;; he has been with my poor
Randolph for the last two hours; he will tell us what he thinks of his
malady;'&mdash;and you, sir, came into the room."</p>

<p>"Do you remember this circumstance, doctor?" said Falkner to
me, "do you remember coming in from the bedside of your patient to
the room where my mother and myself were sitting,&mdash;do you remember
how closely I questioned you?"</p>

<p>"<em>I do</em>," answered I dryly, "and also what passed in the sick man's
chamber. But proceed with your narration&mdash;I think you have not
much more to say."</p>

<p>"Is it then still a profound <em>secret</em> what that man, or devil,&mdash;I know
not which he is,&mdash;communicated to you at that time?" inquired poor
L&mdash;&mdash;, looking at me with eyes that seemed to search my very soul.
"You told us, doctor, he was dying, and I thought so too myself afterwards;
for I was prevailed on to visit him you both called <em>my benefactor</em>!&mdash;Oh
God! oh God! what is the reason that he did not die?&mdash;that
in a few days he&mdash;this hunchback&mdash;rose from that couch
where we all expected he would close for ever those melancholy
eyes? Instead of our carrying him to the churchyard, and burying
him deep, deep there, he broke his plighted faith to my ill-used mother,
and rose from his couch to <em>become the partner of hers</em>&mdash;her veritable
husband! Was it not this accursed knowledge that utterly destroyed
me? Did I not rave then, beat my breast, and become a
madman? Did I not attempt the life of her who gave me birth?
And was I not prevented from fulfilling my design by this same loathsome
being, who bound my hands together with a strength as if he
had been a giant; not the pigmy that he is?&mdash;He overcame me&mdash;I
remember this, now, full well."</p>

<p>"All this is nothing new to me," said I, "for I attended you all the
time of your illness, <em>and you have been very bad indeed</em>. But what
then? These clouds will pass away, and the sun, the brilliant star of
your mind, will be much brighter than it has ever been. Can you
bear Falkner L&mdash;&mdash; to hear what passed in the sick chamber of him
you have called by such opprobrious names?"</p>

<p>"Before I answer you, doctor, you must resolve me one question,"
and the brow of the young man darkened:&mdash;"How long have I been
ill?" This was whispered rather than spoken.</p>

<p>"Exactly ten months," I replied. "Is that your question?" and I
smiled upon him, for I knew what was in his mind.</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "it is only the scaffolding about it. It shall
out," cried poor L&mdash;&mdash; furiously, "and on its reply depends whether I
will ever speak again to man or woman during my short remnant of
life. It is a question to me of vital importance indeed!" I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
reluctant to give it utterance, so much disgust do I feel with this whole
affair; yet I have a burning desire <em>to know</em>, and I will be satisfied."</p>

<p>"So had our first parents, L&mdash;&mdash;," said I; "but they found the
fruit of the tree of knowledge bitter and indigestive. <em>Wisdom</em> is always
preferable to <em>knowledge</em>; for it yields content, calmness, holiness.
But what is your question? I think I know its purport&mdash;out with it."</p>

<p>"Has my mother given birth to a child of that abominable man
with the club-foot?" cried poor L&mdash;&mdash; almost inaudibly, with a lip quivering,
an eye flaming; "is there <em>another</em> little wretch upon this earth
inheriting the deformities of that monster?&mdash;a creature doomed to
walk in shoes that give no sound, and therefore of magic and unlawful
make?"</p>

<p>"What nonsense you talk, L&mdash;&mdash;!" cried I. "Why, I took up
those very shoes and examined them curiously, when I visited the
sick chamber of their owner. I was struck with their strange make,
and was much pleased with the invention, which is a German one;
and I mean to write over for a pair or two of boots, made on this same
construction, as I dislike creaking appendages to my feet of all things;
for it sounds so <em>material</em>, you know. The soles of these are elastic and
hollow, filled, moreover, with gas, which makes the wearer light-footed.
We&mdash;that is, you and I&mdash;do not want such inventions to our <em>heads</em>,
you know," I said a little archly; "we are light-headed enough without
the assistance of German mechanists; but for their shoes we thank
them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they have helped us a little to be light-headed too, notwithstanding,"
retorted L&mdash;&mdash; with a spirit I was delighted to see.
"German philosophy may produce the same effects on the head as
German boots on the feet. But you astonish me by what you say!
Elastic hollow soles!&mdash;then there was no necromancy in them after
all! But still you have not answered my question, doctor."</p>

<p>"All in good time, L&mdash;&mdash;; let me first put one category to you.
What should make you have such a dreadful abhorrence to infants?&mdash;are
they not the most interesting beings in the universe?&mdash;does
not heaven lie about them then? As for inheriting a club-foot, that
is all stuff. The children of Socrates did not inherit his snub nose, nor
the mind either of him who chanced to have this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nez retroussé</i>."</p>

<p>"What am I to infer from this preamble?" demanded L&mdash;&mdash; with
a face as white as death.</p>

<p>"Why, that you have as lovely a little sister as ever opened a pair
of eyes upon this earthly scene&mdash;such a pair of eyes, too!&mdash;large,
dark, magnificent eyes,&mdash;much handsomer than yours, L&mdash;&mdash;, and they
are not much to be found fault with. In short, my little god-daughter
Emma is a perfect beauty, of about three weeks old,&mdash;and I am ready
to enter the lists with any one who is bold enough to deny the full
power of her infantine charms."</p>

<p>There was a long pause after this.</p>

<p>"And her feet?" inquired L&mdash;&mdash;, gasping for breath, "has she&mdash;club
feet?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! you never expected more than one; her father&mdash;&mdash;"
But he wildly interrupted me.</p>

<p>"Oh! name him not!&mdash;name him not!&mdash;Deceiver!&mdash;liar!&mdash;hypocrite!&mdash;I
knew it would come to this!&mdash;this is what has maddened
me&mdash;I knew it would be so!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you have been a seer and a prophet," replied I, "all along.
Allow me to bow to your superior wisdom. I never dreamed of such
a thing; yet would it not have been as it has turned out, but for my
advice, my judgment."</p>

<p>"What on earth could <em>you</em> have had to do with this wretched
business?" inquired L&mdash;&mdash;. "Pray, pray, do not confuse me more
than you can help."</p>

<p>"I am going rather to enlighten you, L&mdash;&mdash;," said I, "and must
beg you seriously to attend now to me. You know that I was summoned
to attend upon Mr. Randolph Maxwell, the first cousin of
your mother. Well, I found him in almost a dying state,&mdash;weak, exhausted,
dejected in the extreme, without a wish to live. I inquired
into the symptoms of his malady. I could gain no information from
his words; but those melancholy yet beautiful eyes of his gave me a
suspicion. Having obtained a clue, and <em>not</em> having the same contemptible
and erroneous opinion of my patient as yourself, I arrived
at length at the truth, and found that this '<em>demon</em>,' as you are
pleased to call him, was falling a sacrifice to his high sense of honour,
and delicacy to his idolised wife's feelings. He had adored her ever,
and believed firmly, when he wrote that last epistle to her which you
saw, that he was capable of keeping his word; that the society of his
Emma as a friend and sister only would fully satisfy every desire of
his heart. But in living with her, in receiving her smiles, and hearing
himself called 'Randolph,' 'dear Randolph,' by lips so lovely and beloved,
he found that he was human, and had human wishes to gratify.
Thus, like Tantalus, did he languish and droop, yet without a hope,
uttering a complaint, or making a single effort to draw her compassion,
or even to let his sufferings be understood by her. By heavens!
L&mdash;&mdash;, that man, small as he is in stature, deformed and unpleasant
to look upon, is one of the greatest heroes, ay, martyrs, let it be
added,&mdash;I speak as a medical man,&mdash;that history has to boast of!"&mdash;I
paused as I said this, and waited for some observation from my
young friend; but he merely leaned his cheek upon his hand, and cast
his eyes upon the ground.&mdash;"Shall I proceed?" asked I.</p>

<p>"I can finish the narrative myself," said he: "you communicated
the state of her friend, of course, to my mother, and she,&mdash;to save his
life,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Told me," cried I, "that she had now been so long accustomed
to his presence, so familiarised with his uncouth appearance, that she
scarcely noticed his deformities; that his attentions, his delicacy,
his devotedness to her for so long a time, had taken from her all repugnance
to his person; and that she could truly say, 'she loved him
even as he was.'" L&mdash;&mdash; groaned aloud. "Oh!" continued I, "I
wish I could describe to you the feelings of this man with the <em>club-foot</em>,&mdash;this
being so despised, so loathed by you,&mdash;when I repeated to
him, word for word, what his adored wife had imparted to me,&mdash;when
the delightful conviction stole into his mind that there was one woman
in the world, and that one the most valued and the most lovely, who
could look upon him, dwarf, hunchback as he was, with eyes of returning
affection,&mdash;that he was loved in some measure with a return.&mdash;After
all, L&mdash;&mdash;, what is there in the outside?"</p>

<p>"Is my mother happy?" at length inquired L&mdash;&mdash; with a burning
cheek, but a softening tone of voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>"The only drawback on her felicity is from the waywardness, the
morbid temper, and the cruel prejudices of her only son," said I.
"What is there in a mere form, the husk, the shell, the covering of
the immortal mind? Would you have treated Socrates as you have
treated Mr. Maxwell?&mdash;thus have despised Alexander Pope?"</p>

<p>"<em>Socrates had not a club-foot</em>," answered he; but I fancied that an
air of pleasantry accompanied the observation: "Pope had not this
deformity."</p>

<p>"But other great men had," I replied, "who were as inferior to
the gentleman we have been speaking of in <em>true heroism</em>, as they excelled
him in other mere personal attractions. Remember the adage,
L&mdash;&mdash;, 'Handsome is who handsome does.'"</p>

<p>"Doctor E&mdash;&mdash;" exclaimed Falkner L&mdash;&mdash;, after a pause of an
entire minute, for I noted it by my stop-watch,&mdash;"Doctor E&mdash;&mdash;, I
will see this infant sister of mine; I will see its&mdash;its father also; I
will be one of that happy family.&mdash;Oh, what a monster of prejudice
have I been until this very hour!"</p>

<p>"You say right, my dear L&mdash;&mdash;; prejudice does make monsters of
mankind,&mdash;<em>it has made you mad</em>,&mdash;but happily you are restored.
Look not in future on the outside of the cup and platter; for be
assured that the pearl beyond all price is to be found within. Prejudice
and pride are, according to my experience, the causes of more
lunacy even than the use of ardent spirits, or the goad of poverty, that
eateth into the very soul."</p>

<p>I had the great satisfaction of seeing that very evening a lovely
female infant, dressed in a white cassimere cloak and hood, trimmed
with swansdown and rich lace, in the arms of the young man, who caressed
the child with every mark of affection, and called her "his dear,
dear little sister!" I smiled to myself also at seeing this same young
man looking with pleased delight on its small perfect ivory feet, which
I took care to display; and much pleased was I in hearing him for
the first time in his life say with sincerity,</p>

<p>"<em>My dear Mr. Maxwell</em>, I thank you from my very heart for the
kindness you have shown to this beloved lady, your happy wife, and
the forbearance you have evinced towards her wayward and insulting
son.&mdash;Am I forgiven?"</p>

<p>"From my very soul!" said a voice, now heard without disgust, notwithstanding
its croaking and discordant tone. It was that of "The
Man with the Club-Foot."</p>

<span class="f75">FULL REPORT OF THE</span><br />
FIRST MEETING OF THE MUDFOG ASSOCIATION<br />
<span class="f75">FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF EVERYTHING</span>.</h2>


<p>We have made the most unparalleled and extraordinary exertions
to place before our readers a complete and accurate account
of the proceedings at the late grand meeting of the Mudfog
association, holden in the town of Mudfog; it affords us
great happiness to lay the result before them, in the shape of
various communications received from our able, talented, and
graphic correspondent, expressly sent down for the purpose,
who has immortalised us, himself, Mudfog, and the association,
all at one and the same time. We have been, indeed, for some
days unable to determine who will transmit the greatest name
to posterity; ourselves, who sent our correspondent down; our
correspondent, who wrote an account of the matter; or the association,
who gave our correspondent something to write about.
We rather incline to the opinion that we are the greatest man
of the party, inasmuch as the notion of an exclusive and authentic
report originated with us; this may be prejudice: it may
arise from a prepossession on our part in our own favour. Be
it so. We have no doubt that every gentleman concerned in
this mighty assemblage is troubled with the same complaint in a
greater or less degree; and it is a consolation to us to know
that we have at least this feeling in common with the great
scientific stars, the brilliant and extraordinary luminaries, whose
speculations we record.</p>

<p>We give our correspondent's letters in the order in which
they reached us. Any attempt at amalgamating them into one
beautiful whole, would only destroy that glowing tone, that dash
of wildness, and rich vein of picturesque interest, which pervade
them throughout.</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Mudfog, Monday night, seven o'clock.</em></p>

<p>"We are in a state of great excitement here. Nothing is
spoken of, but the approaching meeting of the association. The
inn-doors are thronged with waiters anxiously looking for the
expected arrivals; and the numerous bills which are wafered up
in the windows of private houses, intimating that there are beds
to let within, give the streets a very animated and cheerful appearance,
the wafers being of a great variety of colours, and the
monotony of printed inscriptions being relieved by every possible
size and style of hand-writing. It is confidently rumoured
that Professors Snore, Doze, and Wheezy have engaged three
beds and a sitting-room at the Pig and Tinder-box. I give
you the rumour as it has reached me; but I cannot, as yet,
vouch for its accuracy. The moment I have been enabled to
obtain any certain information upon this interesting point, you
may depend upon receiving it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p class="author">"<em>Half-past seven.</em></p>

<p>"I have just returned from a personal interview with the
landlord of the Pig and Tinder-box. He speaks confidently
of the probability of Professors Snore, Doze, and Wheezy
taking up their residence at his house during the sitting of the
association, but denies that the beds have been yet engaged; in
which representation he is confirmed by the chambermaid,&mdash;a
girl of artless manners, and interesting appearance. The boots
denies that it is at all likely that Professors Snore, Doze, and
Wheezy will put up here; but I have reason to believe that
this man has been suborned by the proprietor of the Original
Pig, which is the opposition hotel. Amidst such conflicting
testimony it is difficult to arrive at the real truth; but you may
depend upon receiving authentic information upon this point
the moment the fact is ascertained. The excitement still continues.
A boy fell through the window of the pastrycook's shop
at the corner of the High-street about half an hour ago, which
has occasioned much confusion. The general impression is, that
it was an accident. Pray Heaven it may prove so!"</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Tuesday, noon.</em></p>

<p>"At an early hour this morning the bells of all the churches
struck seven o'clock; the effect of which, in the present lively
state of the town, was extremely singular. While I was at
breakfast, a yellow gig, drawn by a dark grey horse, with a
patch of white over his right eyelid, proceeded at a rapid pace
in the direction of the Original Pig stables; it is currently reported
that this gentleman has arrived here for the purpose of
attending the association, and, from what I have heard, I consider
it extremely probable, although nothing decisive is yet
known regarding him. You may conceive the anxiety with
which we are all looking forward to the arrival of the four
o'clock coach this afternoon.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the excited state of the populace, no outrage
has yet been committed, owing to the admirable discipline
and discretion of the police, who are nowhere to be seen. A
barrel-organ is playing opposite my window, and groups of
people, offering fish and vegetables for sale, parade the streets.
With these exceptions everything is quiet, and I trust will continue
so."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Five o'clock.</em></p>

<p>"It is now ascertained beyond all doubt that Professors
Snore, Doze, and Wheezy will <em>not</em> repair to the Pig and Tinder-box,
but have actually engaged apartments at the Original
Pig. This intelligence is <em>exclusive</em>; and I leave you and your
readers to draw their own inferences from it. Why Professor
Wheezy, of all people in the world, should repair to the Original
Pig in preference to the Pig and Tinder-box, it is not easy
to conceive. The professor is a man who should be above all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
such petty feelings. Some people here, openly impute treachery
and a distinct breach of faith to Professors Snore and Doze;
while others, again, are disposed to acquit them of any culpability
in the transaction, and to insinuate that the blame rests
solely with Professor Wheezy. I own that I incline to the
latter opinion; and, although it gives me great pain to speak
in terms of censure or disapprobation of a man of such transcendent
genius and acquirements, still I am bound to say, that
if my suspicions be well founded, and if all the reports which
have reached my ears be true, I really do not well know what
to make of the matter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Slug, so celebrated for his statistical researches, arrived
this afternoon by the four o'clock stage. His complexion is a
dark purple, and he has a habit of sighing constantly. He
looked extremely well, and appeared in high health and spirits.
Mr. Woodensconse also came down in the same conveyance.
The distinguished gentleman was fast asleep on his arrival, and
I am informed by the guard that he had been so, the whole way.
He was, no doubt, preparing for his approaching fatigues; but
what gigantic visions must those be, that flit through the brain
of such a man, when his body is in a state of torpidity!</p>

<p>"The influx of visitors increases every moment. I am told
(I know not how truly) that two post-chaises have arrived at
the Original Pig within the last half-hour; and I myself observed
a wheelbarrow, containing three carpet-bags and a bundle,
entering the yard of the Pig and Tinder-box no longer ago
than five minutes since. The people are still quietly pursuing
their ordinary occupations; but there is a wildness in their
eyes, and an unwonted rigidity in the muscles of their countenances,
which shows to the observant spectator that their expectations
are strained to the very utmost pitch. I fear, unless
some very extraordinary arrivals take place to-night, that consequences
may arise from this popular ferment, which every man
of sense and feeling would deplore."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Twenty minutes past six.</em></p>

<p>"I have just heard that the boy who fell through the pastrycook's
window last night, has died of the fright. He was suddenly
called upon to pay three and sixpence for the damage
done, and his constitution, it seems, was not strong enough to
bear up against the shock. The inquest, it is said, will be held
to-morrow."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Three-quarters past seven.</em></p>

<p>"Professors Muff and Nogo have just driven up to the
hotel door; they at once ordered dinner with great condescension.
We are all very much delighted with the urbanity of
their manners, and the ease with which they adapt themselves
to the forms and ceremonies of ordinary life. Immediately on
their arrival they sent for the head-waiter, and privately requested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
him to purchase a live dog,&mdash;as cheap a one as he
could meet with,&mdash;and to send him up after dinner, with a pie-board,
a knife and fork, and a clean plate. It is conjectured
that some experiments will be tried upon the dog to-night; if
any particulars should transpire, I will forward them by express."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Half-past eight.</em></p>

<p>"The animal has been procured. He is a pug-dog, of rather
intelligent appearance, in good condition, and with very short
legs. He has been tied to a curtain-peg in a dark room, and
is howling dreadfully."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Ten minutes to nine.</em></p>

<p>"The dog has just been rung for. With an instinct which
would appear almost the result of reason, the sagacious animal
seized the waiter by the calf of the leg when he approached to
take him, and made a desperate, though ineffectual resistance.
I have not been able to procure admission to the apartment occupied
by the scientific gentlemen; but, judging from the
sounds which reached my ears when I stood upon the landing-place
outside the door, just now, I should be disposed to say that
the dog had retreated growling beneath some article of furniture,
and was keeping the professors at bay. This conjecture
is confirmed by the testimony of the ostler, who, after peeping
through the keyhole, assures me that he distinctly saw Professor
Nogo on his knees, holding forth a small bottle of prussic acid,
to which the animal, who was crouched beneath an arm-chair,
obstinately declined to smell. You cannot imagine the feverish
state of irritation we are in, lest the interests of science should
be sacrificed to the prejudices of a brute creature, who is not endowed
with sufficient sense to foresee the incalculable benefits
which the whole human race may derive from so very slight a
concession on his part."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Nine o'clock.</em></p>

<p>"The dog's tail and ears have been sent down stairs to be
washed; from which circumstance we infer that the animal is no
more. His forelegs have been delivered to the boots to be
brushed, which strengthens the supposition."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Half after ten.</em></p>

<p>"My feelings are so overpowered by what has taken place
in the course of the last hour and a half, that I have scarcely
strength to detail the rapid succession of events which have quite
bewildered all those who are cognizant of their occurrence. It
appears that the pug-dog mentioned in my last was surreptitiously
obtained,&mdash;stolen, in fact,&mdash;by some person attached to
the stable department, from an unmarried lady resident in this
town. Frantic on discovering the loss of her favourite, the
lady rushed distractedly into the street, calling in the most
heart-rending and pathetic manner upon the passengers to restore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
her, her Augustus,&mdash;for so the deceased was named, in affectionate
remembrance of a former lover of his mistress, to
whom he bore a striking personal resemblance, which renders
the circumstance additionally affecting. I am not yet in a condition
to inform you what circumstances induced the bereaved
lady to direct her steps to the hotel which had witnessed the
last struggles of her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protegé</i>. I can only state that she arrived
there, at the very instant when his detached members were
passing through the passage on a small tray. Her shrieks still
reverberate in my ears! I grieve to say that the expressive features
of Professor Muff were much scratched and lacerated by
the injured lady; and that Professor Nogo, besides sustaining
several severe bites, has lost some handfuls of hair from the
same cause. It must be some consolation to these gentlemen to
know that their ardent attachment to scientific pursuits has
alone occasioned these unpleasant consequences; for which the
sympathy of a grateful country will sufficiently reward them.
The unfortunate lady remains at the Pig and Tinder-box, and
up to this time is reported in a very precarious state.</p>

<p>"I need scarcely tell you that this unlooked-for catastrophe
has cast a damp and gloom upon us in the midst of our exhilaration;
natural in any case, but greatly enhanced in this, by the
amiable qualities of the deceased animal, who appears to have
been much and deservedly respected by the whole of his acquaintance."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Twelve o'clock.</em></p>

<p>"I take the last opportunity before sealing my parcel to inform
you that the boy who fell through the pastrycook's window is not
dead, as was universally believed, but alive and well. The report
appears to have had its origin in his mysterious disappearance.
He was found half an hour since on the premises of a sweet-stuff
maker, where a raffle had been announced for a second-hand
seal-skin cap and a tambourine; and where&mdash;a sufficient number
of members not having been obtained at first&mdash;he had patiently
waited until the list was completed. This fortunate discovery
has in some degree restored our gaiety and cheerfulness. It is
proposed to get up a subscription for him without delay.</p>

<p>"Everybody is nervously anxious to see what to-morrow will
bring forth. If any one should arrive in the course of the
night, I have left strict directions to be called immediately. I
should have sat up, indeed, but the agitating events of this day
have been too much for me.</p>

<p>"No news yet, of either of the Professors Snore, Doze, or
Wheezy. It is very strange!"</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Wednesday afternoon.</em></p>

<p>"All is now over; and, upon one point at least, I am at
length enabled to set the minds of your readers at rest. The three
professors arrived at ten minutes after two o'clock, and, instead
of taking up their quarters at the Original Pig, as it was universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
understood in the course of yesterday that they would
assuredly have done, drove straight to the Pig and Tinder-box,
where they threw off the mask at once, and openly announced
their intention of remaining. Professor Wheezy <em>may</em> reconcile this
very extraordinary conduct with <em>his</em> notions of fair and equitable
dealing, but I would recommend Professor Wheezy to be cautious
how he presumes too far upon his well-earned reputation. How
such a man as Professor Snore, or, which is still more extraordinary,
such an individual as Professor Doze, can quietly allow
himself to be mixed up with such proceedings as these, you will
naturally inquire. Upon this head, rumour is silent; I have
my speculations, but forbear to give utterance to them just
now."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Four o'clock.</em></p>

<p>"The town is filling fast; eighteenpence has been offered
for a bed, and refused. Several gentlemen were under the necessity
last night of sleeping in the brick-fields, and on the steps
of doors, for which they were taken before the magistrates in a
body this morning, and committed to prison as vagrants for
various terms. One of these persons I understand to be a highly-respectable
tinker, of great practical skill, who had forwarded
a paper to the president of Section D. Mechanical Science, on
the construction of pipkins with copper bottoms and safety-valves,
of which report speaks highly. The incarceration of this
gentleman is greatly to be regretted, as his absence will preclude
any discussion on the subject.</p>

<p>"The bills are being taken down in all directions, and lodgings
are being secured on almost any terms. I have heard of
fifteen shillings a week for two rooms, exclusive of coals and
attendance, but I can scarcely believe it. The excitement is
dreadful. I was informed this morning that the civil authorities,
apprehensive of some outbreak of popular feeling, had
commanded a recruiting sergeant and two corporals to be under
arms; and that, with the view of not irritating the people unnecessarily
by their presence, they had been requested to take
up their position before daybreak in a turnpike, distant about a
quarter of a mile from the town. The vigour and promptness
of these measures cannot be too highly extolled.</p>

<p>"Intelligence has just been brought me, that an elderly female,
in a state of inebriety, has declared in the open street her
intention to 'do' for Mr. Slug. Some statistical returns compiled
by that gentleman, relative to the consumption of raw
spirituous liquors in this place, are supposed to be the cause of
the wretch's animosity. It is added, that this declaration was
loudly cheered by a crowd of persons who had assembled on the
spot; and that one man had the boldness to designate Mr. Slug
aloud by the opprobrious epithet of 'Stick-in-the-mud!' It is
earnestly to be hoped that now, when the moment has arrived
for their interference, the magistrates will not shrink from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
exercise of that power which is vested in them by the constitution
of our common country."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Half-past ten.</em></p>

<p>"The disturbance, I am happy to inform you, has been completely
quelled, and the ringleader taken into custody. She had
a pail of cold water thrown over her, previous to being locked
up, and expresses great contrition and uneasiness. We are all
in a fever of anticipation about to-morrow; but, now that we
are within a few hours of the meeting of the association, and at
last enjoy the proud consciousness of having its illustrious members
amongst us, I trust and hope everything may go off peaceably.
I shall send you a full report of to-morrow's proceedings
by the night coach."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Eleven o'clock.</em></p>

<p>"I open my letter to say that nothing whatever has occurred
since I folded it up."</p>

<p class="author">"<em>Thursday.</em></p>

<p>"The sun rose this morning at the usual hour. I did not
observe anything particular in the aspect of the glorious planet,
except that he appeared to me (it might have been a delusion of
my heightened fancy) to shine with more than common brilliancy,
and to shed a refulgent lustre upon the town, such as I had
never observed before. This is the more extraordinary, as the
sky was perfectly cloudless, and the atmosphere peculiarly fine.
At half-past nine o'clock the general committee assembled, with
the last year's president in the chair. The report of the council
was read; and one passage, which stated that the council had
corresponded with no less than three thousand five hundred
and seventy-one persons, (all of whom paid their own postage,)
on no fewer than seven thousand two hundred and forty-three
topics, was received with a degree of enthusiasm which no
efforts could suppress. The various committees and sections
having been appointed, and the mere formal business transacted,
the great proceedings of the meeting commenced at eleven
o'clock precisely. I had the happiness of occupying a most
eligible position at that time, in</p>

<p class="center"><span class="f90">"SECTION A.&mdash;ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY.</span><br />
<span class="f75">"GREAT ROOM, PIG AND TINDER-BOX.<br />
"PRESIDENT&mdash;PROFESSOR SNORE. VICE-PRESIDENTS&mdash;PROFESSORS DOZE
AND WHEEZY.</span>
</p>

<p>"The scene at this moment was particularly striking. The
sun streamed through the windows of the apartments, and tinted
the whole scene with its brilliant rays, bringing out in strong
relief the noble visages of the professors and scientific gentlemen,
who, some with bald heads, some with red heads, some
with brown heads, some with grey heads, some with black
heads, some with block heads, presented a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-d'&oelig;il</i> which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
eye-witness will readily forget. In front of these gentlemen
were papers and inkstands; and round the room, on elevated
benches extending as far as the forms could reach, were assembled
a brilliant concourse of those lovely and elegant women
for which Mudfog is justly acknowledged to be without a
rival in the whole world. The contrast between their fair faces
and the dark coats and trousers of the scientific gentlemen I
shall never cease to remember while Memory holds her seat.</p>

<p>"Time having been allowed for a slight confusion, occasioned
by the falling down of the greater part of the platforms, to
subside, the president called on one of the secretaries to read
a communication entitled, 'Some remarks on the industrious
fleas, with considerations on the importance of establishing infant
schools among that numerous class of society; of directing
their industry to useful and practical ends; and of applying
the surplus fruits thereof, towards providing for them a comfortable
and respectable maintenance in their old age.'</p>

<p>"The Author stated, that, having long turned his attention to
the moral and social condition of these interesting animals, he
had been induced to visit an exhibition in Regent-street, London,
commonly known by the designation of 'The Industrious
Fleas.' He had there seen many fleas, occupied certainly in various
pursuits and avocations, but occupied, he was bound to
add, in a manner which no man of well-regulated mind could
fail to regard with sorrow and regret. One flea, reduced to the
level of a beast of burden, was drawing about a miniature gig,
containing a particularly small effigy of his Grace the Duke of
Wellington; while another was staggering beneath the weight of
a golden model of his great adversary Napoleon Bonaparte.
Some, brought up as mountebanks and ballet-dancers, were performing
a figure-dance (he regretted to observe, that, of the
fleas so employed, several were females); others were in training,
in a small card-board box, for pedestrians,&mdash;mere sporting characters&mdash;and
two were actually engaged in the cold-blooded and
barbarous occupation of duelling; a pursuit from which humanity
recoiled with horror and disgust. He suggested that
measures should be immediately taken to employ the labour of
these fleas as part and parcel of the productive power of the
country, which might easily be done by the establishment among
them of infant schools and houses of industry, in which a system
of virtuous education, based upon sound principles, should
be observed, and moral precepts strictly inculcated. He proposed
that every flea who presumed to exhibit, for hire, music or
dancing, or any species of theatrical entertainment, without a
licence, should be considered a vagabond, and treated accordingly;
in which respect he only placed him upon a level with
the rest of mankind. He would further suggest that their labour
should be placed under the control and regulation of the state,
who should set apart from the profits, a fund for the support of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
superannuated or disabled fleas, their widows and orphans.
With this view, he proposed that liberal premiums should be
offered for the three best designs for a general almshouse; from
which&mdash;as insect architecture was well known to be in a very
advanced and perfect state&mdash;we might possibly derive many valuable
hints for the improvement of our metropolitan universities,
national galleries, and other public edifices.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The President</span> wished to be informed how the ingenious
gentleman proposed to open a communication with fleas generally,
in the first instance, so that they might be thoroughly
imbued with a sense of the advantages they must necessarily
derive from changing their mode of life, and applying themselves
to honest labour. This appeared to him, the only difficulty.</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Author</span> submitted that this difficulty was easily overcome,
or rather that there was no difficulty at all in the case.
Obviously the course to be pursued, if her Majesty's government
could be prevailed upon to take up the plan, would be, to secure
at a remunerative salary the individual to whom he had alluded
as presiding over the exhibition in Regent-street at the period
of his visit. That gentleman would at once be able to put
himself in communication with the mass of the fleas, and to
instruct them in pursuance of some general plan of education,
to be sanctioned by Parliament, until such time as the more
intelligent among them were advanced enough to officiate as
teachers to the rest.</p>

<p>"The President and several members of the section highly
complimented the author of the paper last read, on his most ingenious
and important treatise. It was determined that the
subject should be recommended to the immediate consideration
of the council.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Wigsby</span> produced a cauliflower somewhat larger than
a chaise-umbrella, which had been raised by no other artificial
means than the simple application of highly carbonated soda-water
as manure. He explained that by scooping out the head,
which would afford a new and delicious species of nourishment
for the poor, a parachute, in principle something similar to that
constructed by M. Garnerin, was at once obtained: the stalk of
course being kept downwards. He added that he was perfectly
willing to make a descent from a height of not less than three
miles and a quarter; and had in fact already proposed the same
to the proprietors of Vauxhall Gardens, who in the handsomest
manner at once consented to his wishes, and appointed an early
day next summer for the undertaking; merely stipulating that
the rim of the cauliflower should be previously broken in three
or four places to ensure the safety of the descent.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The President</span> congratulated the public on the <em>grand gala</em>
in store for them, and warmly eulogised the proprietors of the
establishment alluded to, for their love of science, and regard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the safety of human life, both of which did them the highest
honour.</p>

<p>"A Member wished to know how many thousand additional
lamps the royal property would be illuminated with, on the
night after the descent.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Wigsby</span> replied that the point was not yet finally decided;
but he believed it was proposed, over and above the ordinary
illuminations, to exhibit in various devices eight millions
and a half of additional lamps.</p>

<p>"The Member expressed himself much gratified with this
announcement.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Blunderum</span> delighted the section with a most interesting
and valuable paper 'on the last moments of the learned
pig,' which produced a very strong impression upon the assembly,
the account being compiled from the personal recollections
of his favourite attendant. The account stated in the
most emphatic terms that the animal's name was not Toby, but
Solomon; and distinctly proved that he could have no near relatives
in the profession, as many designing persons had falsely
stated, inasmuch as his father, mother, brothers and sisters,
had all fallen victims to the butcher at different times. An
uncle of his, indeed, had with very great labour been traced to
a sty in Somers Town; but as he was in a very infirm state at
the time, being afflicted with measles, and shortly afterwards
disappeared, there appeared too much reason to conjecture that
he had been converted into sausages. The disorder of the
learned pig was originally a severe cold, which, being aggravated
by excessive trough indulgence, finally settled upon the
lungs, and terminated in a general decay of the constitution.
A melancholy instance of a presentiment entertained by the
animal of his approaching dissolution, was recorded. After
gratifying a numerous and fashionable company with his performances,
in which no falling-off whatever, was visible, he fixed
his eyes on the biographer, and, turning to the watch which
lay on the floor, and on which he was accustomed to point out
the hour, deliberately passed his snout twice round the dial.
In precisely four-and-twenty hours from that time he had
ceased to exist!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Professor Wheezy</span> inquired whether, previous to his demise,
the animal had expressed, by signs or otherwise, any
wishes regarding the disposal of his little property.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Blunderum</span> replied, that, when the biographer took up
the pack of cards at the conclusion of the performance, the
animal grunted several times in a significant manner, and nodded
his head as he was accustomed to do, when gratified. From
these gestures it was understood that he wished the attendant
to keep the cards, which he had ever since done. He had not
expressed any wish relative to his watch, which had accordingly
been pawned by the same individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">President</span> wished to know whether any member of
the section had ever seen or conversed with the pig-faced lady,
who was reported to have worn a black velvet mask, and to
have taken her meals from a golden trough.</p>

<p>"After some hesitation a Member replied that the pig-faced
lady was his mother-in-law, and that he trusted the president
would not violate the sanctity of private life.</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">President</span> begged pardon. He had considered the
pig-faced lady a public character. Would the honourable
member object to state, with a view to the advancement of
science, whether she was in any way connected with the learned
pig?</p>

<p>"The Member replied in the same low tone, that, as the question
appeared to involve a suspicion that the learned pig might
be his half-brother, he must decline answering it.</p>

"PRESIDENT&mdash;DR. TOORELL. VICE-PRESIDENTS&mdash;PROFESSORS MUFF AND NOGO.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. Kutankumagen</span> (of Moscow) read to the section a report
of a case which had occurred within his own practice,
strikingly illustrative of the power of medicine, as exemplified
in his successful treatment of a virulent disorder. He had been
called in to visit the patient on the 1st of April 1837. He was
then labouring under symptoms peculiarly alarming to any
medical man. His frame was stout and muscular, his step firm
and elastic, his cheeks plump and red, his voice loud, his appetite
good, his pulse full and round. He was in the constant
habit of eating three meals <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per diem</i>, and of drinking at least
one bottle of wine, and one glass of spirituous liquors diluted
with water, in the course of the four-and-twenty hours. He
laughed constantly, and in so hearty a manner that it was terrible
to hear him. By dint of powerful medicine, low diet, and
bleeding, the symptoms in the course of three days perceptibly
decreased. A rigid perseverance in the same course of treatment
for only one week, accompanied with small doses of water-gruel,
weak broth, and barley-water, led to their entire disappearance.
In the course of a month he was sufficiently recovered
to be carried down stairs by two nurses, and to enjoy an
airing in a close carriage, supported by soft pillows. At the
present moment he was restored so far as to walk about, with
the slight assistance of a crutch and a boy. It would perhaps be
gratifying to the section to learn that he ate little, drank little,
slept little, and was never heard to laugh by any accident whatever.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. W.R. Fee</span>, in complimenting the honourable member
upon the triumphant cure he had effected, begged to ask whether
the patient still bled freely?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. Kutankumagen</span> replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. W.R. Fee.</span>&mdash;And you found that he bled freely during
the whole course of the disorder?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. Kutankumagen.</span>&mdash;Oh dear, yes; most freely.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. Neeshawts</span> supposed, that if the patient had not submitted
to be bled with great readiness and perseverance, so extraordinary
a cure could never, in fact, have been accomplished.
Dr. Kutankumagen rejoined, certainly not.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Knight Bell</span> (M.R.C.S.) exhibited a wax preparation
of the interior of a gentleman who in early life had inadvertently
swallowed a door-key. It was a curious fact that a medical student
of dissipated habits, being present at the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i> examination,
found means to escape unobserved from the room, with that
portion of the coats of the stomach upon which an exact model
of the instrument was distinctly impressed, with which he hastened
to a locksmith of doubtful character, who made a new key
from the pattern so shown to him. With this key the medical
student entered the house of the deceased gentleman, and committed
a burglary to a large amount, for which he was subsequently
tried and executed.</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">President</span> wished to know what became of the original
key after the lapse of years. Mr. Knight Bell replied that the
gentleman was always much accustomed to punch, and it was
supposed the acid had gradually devoured it.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. Neeshawts</span> and several of the members were of opinion
that the key must have lain very cold and heavy upon the gentleman's
stomach.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Knight Bell</span> believed it did at first. It was worthy
of remark, perhaps, that for some years the gentleman was
troubled with a night-mare, under the influence of which, he
always imagined himself a wine-cellar door.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Professor Muff</span> related a very extraordinary and convincing
proof of the wonderful efficacy of the system of infinitesimal
doses, which the section were doubtless aware was based upon
the theory that the very minutest amount of any given drug,
properly dispersed through the human frame, would be productive
of precisely the same result as a very large dose administered
in the usual manner. Thus, the fortieth part of a grain
of calomel was supposed to be equal to a five-grain calomel pill,
and so on in proportion throughout the whole range of medicine.
He had tried the experiment in a curious manner upon a publican
who had been brought into the hospital with a broken
head, and was cured upon the infinitesimal system in the incredibly
short space of three months. This man was a hard
drinker. He (Professor Muff) had dispersed three drops of
rum through a bucket of water, and requested the man to drink
the whole. What was the result? Before he had drunk a
quart, he was in a state of beastly intoxication; and five other
men were made dead-drunk with the remainder.</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">President</span> wished to know whether an infinitesimal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
dose of soda-water would have recovered them? Professor
Muff replied that the twenty-fifth part of a tea-spoonful, properly
administered to each patient would have sobered him immediately.
The President remarked that this was a most important
discovery, and he hoped the Lord Mayor and Court of
Aldermen would patronise it immediately.</p>

<p>"A Member begged to be informed whether it would be possible
to administer&mdash;say, the twentieth part of a grain of bread
and cheese to all grown-up paupers, and the fortieth part to
children, with the same satisfying effect as their present allowance.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Professor Muff</span> was willing to stake his professional reputation
on the perfect adequacy of such a quantity of food to the
support of human life&mdash;in workhouses; the addition of the fifteenth
part of a grain of pudding twice a week, would render it
a high diet.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Professor Nogo</span> called the attention of the section to a very
extraordinary case of animal magnetism. A private watchman,
being merely looked at by the operator from the opposite side of
a wide street, was at once observed to be in a very drowsy and
languid state. He was followed to his box, and being once
slightly rubbed on the palms of the hands, fell into a sound
sleep, in which he continued without intermission for ten hours.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Slug</span> stated to the section the result of some calculations
he had made with great difficulty and labour, regarding
the state of infant education among the middle classes of London.
He found that, within a circle of three miles from the
Elephant and Castle, the following were the names and numbers
of children's books principally in circulation:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="booklist">

</table></div>

<p>"He found that the proportion of Robinson Crusoes to Philip
Quarlls was as four and a half to one; and that the preponderance
of Valentine and Orsons over Goody Two Shoeses was
as three and an eighth of the former to half a one of the latter:
a comparison of Seven Champions with Simple Simons gave the
same result. The ignorance that prevailed, was lamentable.
One child, on being asked whether he would rather be Saint
George of England or a respectable tallow-chandler, instantly
replied, 'Taint George of Ingling.' Another, a little boy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
eight years old, was found to be firmly impressed with a belief
in the existence of dragons, and openly stated that it was his intention
when he grew up, to rush forth sword in hand for the
deliverance of captive princesses, and the promiscuous slaughter
of giants. Not one child among the number interrogated had
ever heard of Mungo Park,&mdash;some inquiring whether he was at
all connected with the black man that swept the crossing; and
others whether he was in any way related to the Regent's Park.
They had not the slightest conception of the commonest principles
of mathematics, and considered Sinbad the Sailor the most
enterprising voyager that the world had ever produced.</p>

<p>"A Member strongly deprecating the use of all the other
books mentioned, suggested that Jack and Jill might perhaps
be exempted from the general censure, inasmuch as the hero
and heroine, in the very outset of the tale, were depicted as going
<em>up</em> a hill to fetch a pail of water, which was a laborious and
useful occupation,&mdash;supposing the family linen was being washed,
for instance.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Slug</span> feared that the moral effect of this passage was
more than counterbalanced by another in a subsequent part of
the poem, in which very gross allusion was made to the mode in
which the heroine was personally chastised by her mother</p>

<p class="linequot">"'For laughing at Jack's disaster;'</p>

<p>besides, the whole work had this one great fault, <em>it was not
true</em>.</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">President</span> complimented the honourable member on
the excellent distinction he had drawn. Several other members,
too, dwelt upon the immense and urgent necessity of storing the
minds of children with nothing but facts and figures; which process
the President very forcibly remarked, had made them (the
section) the men they were.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Slug</span> then stated some curious calculations respecting
the dogs'-meat barrows of London. He found that the total
number of small carts and barrows engaged in dispensing provision
to the cats and dogs of the metropolis, was one thousand
seven hundred and forty-three. The average number of skewers
delivered daily with the provender, by each dogs'-meat cart or
barrow was thirty-six. Now, multiplying the number of skewers
so delivered, by the number of barrows, a total of sixty-two
thousand seven hundred and forty-eight skewers daily would
be obtained. Allowing that, of these sixty-two thousand seven
hundred and forty-eight skewers, the odd two thousand seven
hundred and forty-eight were accidentally devoured with the
meat, by the most voracious of the animals supplied, it followed
that sixty thousand skewers per day, or the enormous number
of twenty-one millions nine hundred thousand skewers annually,
were wasted in the kennels and dust-holes of London; which,
if collected and warehoused, would in ten years' time afford a
mass of timber more than sufficient for the construction of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
first-rate vessel of war for the use of her Majesty's navy, to
be called 'The Royal Skewer,' and to become under that name
the terror of all the enemies of this island.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. X. Ledbrain</span> read a very ingenious communication,
from which it appeared that the total number of legs belonging
to the manufacturing population of one great town in Yorkshire
was, in round numbers, forty thousand, while the total number
of chair and stool legs in their houses was only thirty thousand,
which, upon the very favourable average of three legs to a seat,
yielded only ten thousand seats in all. From this calculation
it would appear,&mdash;not taking wooden or cork legs into the account,
but allowing two legs to every person,&mdash;that ten thousand
individuals (one-half of the whole population) were either
destitute of any rest for their legs at all, or passed the whole of
their leisure time in sitting upon boxes.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Professor Queerspeck</span> exhibited an elegant model of a portable
railway, neatly mounted in a green case, for the waistcoat
pocket. By attaching this beautiful instrument to his boots,
any Bank or public-office clerk could transport himself from
his place of residence to his place of business, at the easy rate
of sixty-five miles an hour, which, to gentlemen of sedentary
pursuits, would be an incalculable advantage.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The President</span> was desirous of knowing whether it was necessary
to have a level surface on which the gentleman was to
run.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Professor Queerspeck</span> explained that City gentlemen would
run in trains, being handcuffed together to prevent confusion or
unpleasantness. For instance, trains would start every morning
at eight, nine, and ten o'clock, from Camden Town, Islington,
Camberwell, Hackney, and various other places in which City
gentlemen are accustomed to reside. It would be necessary to
have a level, but he had provided for this difficulty by proposing
that the best line that the circumstances would admit of, should
be taken through the sewers which undermine the streets of the
metropolis, and which, well lighted by jets from the gas-pipes
which run immediately above them, would form a pleasant and
commodious arcade, especially in winter-time, when the inconvenient
custom of carrying umbrellas, now so general, could be
wholly dispensed with. In reply to another question, Professor
Queerspeck stated that no substitute for the purposes to which
these arcades were at present devoted had yet occurred to him,
but that he hoped no fanciful objection on this head would be
allowed to interfere with so great an undertaking.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Jobba</span> produced a forcing-machine on a novel plan, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
bringing joint-stock railway shares prematurely to a premium.
The instrument was in the form of an elegant gilt weather-glass
of most dazzling appearance, and was worked behind, by strings,
after the manner of a pantomime trick, the strings being always
pulled by the directors of the company to which the machine
belonged. The quicksilver was so ingeniously placed, that
when the acting directors held shares in their pockets, figures
denoting very small expenses and very large returns appeared
upon the glass; but the moment the directors parted with these
pieces of paper, the estimate of needful expenditure suddenly
increased itself to an immense extent, while the statements of
certain profits became reduced in the same proportion. Mr.
Jobba stated that the machine had been in constant requisition
for some months past, and he had never once known it to fail.</p>

<p>"A Member expressed his opinion that it was extremely neat
and pretty. He wished to know whether it was not liable to
accidental derangement? Mr. Jobba said that the whole machine
was undoubtedly liable to be blown up, but that was the
only objection to it.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Professor Nogo</span> arrived from the anatomical section to exhibit
a model of a safety fire-escape, which could be fixed at any
time, in less than half an hour, and by means of which, the
youngest or most infirm persons (successfully resisting the progress
of the flames until it was quite ready) could be preserved
if they merely balanced themselves for a few minutes on the sill
of their bed-room window, and got into the escape without falling
into the street. The Professor stated that the number of
boys who had been rescued in the day-time by this machine
from houses which were not on fire, was almost incredible. Not
a conflagration had occurred in the whole of London for many
months past to which the escape had not been carried on the
very next day, and put in action before a concourse of persons.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The President</span> inquired whether there was not some difficulty
in ascertaining which was the top of the machine, and
which the bottom, in cases of pressing emergency?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Professor Nogo</span> explained that of course it could not be
expected to act quite as well when there was a fire, as when
there was not a fire; but in the former case he thought it would
be of equal service whether the top were up or down."</p>

<p>With the last section, our correspondent concludes his most
able and faithful Report, which will never cease to reflect credit
upon him for his scientific attainments, and upon us for our enterprising
spirit. It is needless to take a review of the subjects
which have been discussed; of the mode in which they have been
examined; of the great truths which they have elicited. They
are now before the world, and we leave them to read, to consider,
and to profit.</p>

may again be present, and that we may be once more the means
of placing his communications before the world. Until that period
we have been prevailed upon to allow this number of our
Miscellany to be retailed to the public, or wholesaled to the
trade, without any advance upon our usual price.</p>

<p>We have only to add, that the committees are now broken up,
and that Mudfog is once again restored to its accustomed tranquillity,&mdash;that

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="MEMOIR_OF_BEAU_NASH" id="MEMOIR_OF_BEAU_NASH"></a>MEMOIR OF BEAU NASH.</h2>


<p>Richard Nash&mdash;or Beau Nash, as he is commonly called&mdash;was
born at Swansea, in the autumn of the year 1674. His father possessed
a moderate income, which he derived from a partnership in
a glass manufactory; and his mother was niece to Colonel Poyer, a
chivalrous old Cavalier, who was executed by order of Cromwell for
defending Pembroke Castle against the assaults of the Roundheads.
At the usual age young Nash was sent to a private school at Carmarthen,
whence in due time he was transferred to Jesus College,
Oxford, where he distinguished himself by an extraordinary and precocious
genius for intrigue and gallantry. Before he was seventeen,
he had got himself into at least a dozen delicate dilemmas; and, but
for the seasonable interference of his college tutor, would have married
a female of abandoned character, whose wit and beauty had completely
turned his brain.</p>

<p>Disheartened by such licentious conduct, his father abruptly
recalled him from the university, and purchased him a commission
in the army; a profession of which he soon grew weary, the
more especially as he had little besides the slender pay of an ensign
to support him. Finding, however, that it was necessary to
make some sort of exertion in order to obtain a decent livelihood,
our Beau entered himself as a law-student in the Temple, and for
some months applied himself assiduously to study. But his natural
volatility soon regained its usual ascendency over him, and, dismissing
all thoughts of acquiring fortune and reputation as a lawyer, he set
up for a man of wit and fashion about town, dressing, as one of his
biographers observes, "to the very edge of his finances," exhibiting
himself conspicuously in the side-boxes of the theatres, cultivating
the acquaintance of young men of rank and wealth, and practising
those arts of address and persuasion for which he was afterwards so
celebrated.</p>

<p>It was while he was a student in the Temple that a circumstance
occurred which gave a wondrous lift to his sense of self-importance,
and brought him before the gay world in the very way
he most preferred. It seems that it had been long the custom of the
different inns of court to entertain our sovereigns on their accession
to the crown with a dramatic pageant; and, on the accession of William
the Third, Nash was appointed to conduct this entertainment, a
task which he fulfilled so much to his Majesty's satisfaction, that he
made him an offer of knighthood. But he refused this honour, at the
same time hinting that he should have no objection to be made one
of the Poor Knights of Windsor, for then he should have a fortune
sufficient to maintain his new dignity. The King smiled, but took no
further notice of this broad hint, for he was not one to give pensions
without value received; and jokes, even of the first water, always
ranked low in his estimation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 506px;">
<a id="BNASH"></a><img src="images/i439.jpg" width="506" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">BEAU NASH</div>
</div>

<p>This affair of the pageant procured Nash many associates among the
rich and the titled, who were delighted by his good-humoured vivacity,
his easy assurance, his clever after-dinner stories, and his familiar
acquaintance with the habits of town life. Many characteristic
anecdotes are told of him at this gay period of his life. On one occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
when called on by the masters of the Temple for certain accounts,
among other items he made this odd charge, "For making
one man happy, ten pounds." "What is the meaning of this, sir?"
said one of the dignitaries in his gravest and most authoritative manner.
"Why, to tell you the truth," replied Nash, "I happened a
few days ago to overhear a poor man, who had a large family, say
that ten pounds would make him happy for life, and I could not resist
the opportunity of trying the experiment." The masters were so
much struck with the singularity of this explanation, that they not
only allowed the charge, but even insisted on doubling it, in testimony
of their approbation of Nash's benevolence. On another occasion,
having gone down on a sporting excursion to York, our thoughtless
Beau lost all his money at the gaming-table; and on applying
for assistance to a college friend whom he met with in the city, was
promised the loan of fifty pounds, provided he would stand at the
great door of the Minster in a blanket, just as the people were
coming out of church. Nash unhesitatingly agreed to do so, but had
not stood there long before he was discovered by the dean, who had
some slight acquaintance with him. "What!" exclaimed the divine,
"Mr. Nash in masquerade?" "Not so, reverend sir; I am merely
doing penance for keeping bad company;" saying which, he pointed
to his companion, who was not a little annoyed at finding the laugh
thus unexpectedly turned against him. A few days afterwards, Nash
won another wager by riding naked through a country village on a
cow, a freak which in those times was considered a clever practical
joke!</p>

<p>But the strangest of all his adventures is the following. He was
once invited by some convivial officers of the navy on board a frigate
that had just received sailing orders for the Mediterranean; and, after
spending some hours in revelry, found that during his debauch the
vessel had set sail, and that to return to land was wholly out of
the question. He accordingly, nothing loth, made the whole voyage
with his boon companions, and in the course of it was engaged in
action, and severely wounded in the leg, while one of his friends was
shot dead by his side. In after years Nash was singularly fond of
repeating this story; but as he was apt, like Foote's liar, to be occasionally
"poetical in his prose," his hearers always received it with a
wholesome distrust. "I don't believe one word about your having
been kidnapped on board ship," said a lady of distinction to him one
day in the Bath pump-room. "Fact, upon my honour," replied the
unabashed Beau; "and, if you will step with me into another room, I
shall be happy to show you my leg, which will convince you whether
I speak truth or not."</p>

<p>On his return from this naval trip, Nash, who had now reached the
age of thirty, and had neither fortune nor profession to rely on for
support, turned his whole attention to gambling. He encountered
the usual vicissitudes attendant on this course of life, sometimes winning,
but more frequently losing, but always bearing his reverses with
equanimity. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la bagatelle!</i> was his motto. He was not one to
sit down and despond because luck had gone against him. If it rained
one day, he felt sure it would clear up the next; so, shrugged his
shoulders, and waited patiently the approach of more sunny weather.</p>

<p>We now come to the great epoch in Nash's life,&mdash;his accession to
the throne of fashion! About the year 1705, a short visit paid by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
Queen Anne to Bath had the effect of directing the eyes of the gay
world to that city. Our Beau, among others, was attracted to it;
and, having amassed a large sum by gambling, soon made himself conspicuous
by the splendour of his equipage, his trim attire, courteous
manners, and invincible good-humour. In those primitive days Bath
was little better than an ordinary country town; but Nash, with the
prophetic eye of taste, discerned its capabilities as a fashionable watering-place,
and by adroitly flattering the local authorities, and worming
himself into the good graces of all the most influential inhabitants,
succeeded in obtaining the appointment of Master of the Ceremonies,
with sole and uncontrolled power to raise subscriptions for building
pump-rooms, laying out public walks, and making whatever improvements
he might think expedient. From this period down nearly to
the day of his death, Nash was, to all intents and purposes, sovereign
of the city. King George might rule at St. James's, but King
Richard ruled at Bath.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"The eagle he was lord above,</div>
<div class="verse">But Rob was lord below."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>One of the first reforms projected by the new monarch was in the
dress of his subjects. Previous to his accession to the throne it had
invariably been the custom for gentlemen to dance in boots. Nash
resolved to put a stop to this barbarism, and accordingly issued a
ukase ordering his people never henceforth to make their appearance
at the Assembly Rooms, save in pumps, silk stockings, and all the
finery of full dress. For some time this arbitrary mandate was resisted
by more than one Bath Hampden; but perseverance at length
gained the day, and the patriots surrendered at discretion. But not
only was Nash omnipotent at the city of Bladud, but he subdued also
Tunbridge Wells to his authority. In fact, he was as successful a
despot as Napoleon, with this difference in his favour,&mdash;that he ruled
by the force of address, while the other ruled solely by force of arms.
Napoleon tamed refractory subjects by threats of exile or imprisonment;
Nash, by threats of epigrams in the county newspapers.</p>

<p>Having crushed rebellion by the strong arm of power, and brought
to a successful issue the important question of boots, or no boots, our
Beau next proceeded to draw up a social code, which in the strictness
with which it was enforced, and the benefits it conferred on the community
for whose use it was intended, may vie with the famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Code
Napoléon</i>. "I shall go down to posterity," said the French emperor,
"with my code in my hand." Nash has come down to posterity
with his code also in his hand. We have diligently perused this celebrated
document, which, although it contains as many violations of
grammar as a king's speech, is remarkable for the good sense and
simplicity of its directions. On the conduct, in particular, to be observed
by both sexes at public assemblies, it is shrewd and explicit
to a degree. Here Nash showed himself the very incarnation of
punctilious etiquette. Even royalty itself endeavoured in vain to
mitigate the severity of his decrees. The Princess Amelia having
one night humbly requested him to permit her to join in one more
country-dance after the hour of breaking up had arrived, Nash assured
her that the "established rules of Bath resembled the laws of
Lycurgus, which would admit of no alteration without an utter overthrow
of all legitimate authority." Of course, as a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
constitutional House of Brunswick, her Royal Highness succumbed
to the force of this logic.</p>

<p>One of Nash's special objects of dislike, and against which he
pointed the whole artillery of his sarcasm, was a white apron, then
much worn by ladies at public assemblies. To such an extent did
he carry his abhorrence of this article of female apparel, that he actually
stripped the Duchess of Queensberry one evening at a ball,
"and threw her apron," says his biographer, "upon the hinder benches
among the ladies' women;" a significant hint which had all the good
effect he could have desired. If Peter the Great has been universally
praised for his address in prevailing on his countrywomen to adopt
European costumes, surely Richard the Great deserves equal credit
for having been able to persuade his female subjects to lay aside
their darling prejudices in favour of aprons!</p>

<p>Nash had now been upwards of three years Master of the Ceremonies
at Bath; and such was the attention which he paid to its
amusements, and so numerous the improvements he made in the architecture
and public walks of the city, that it soon became the most
fashionable watering-place in the empire. But even this did not
satisfy his thirst for notoriety, and accordingly he founded another
kingdom at Tunbridge Wells, whither he was in the habit of travelling
once a year, in a post-chariot drawn by six greys, with out-riders,
French horns, and all the paraphernalia of royalty. His arrival at
this picturesque spot was always followed by that of the nobility and
gentry, who regarded him as their "Sir Oracle." Even the announcement,
"Nash is coming," was quite sufficient to raise the price of
lodgings, and set every adventurer on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i>.</p>

<p>And here it may be asked, how was it that Nash, who started on
his career without a sixpence in his pocket, and was generally unsuccessful
at play, contrived for so many years to maintain such a
splendid establishment? The answer is soon given. He was a sleeping
partner in one of the most thriving of the Bath gambling-houses.
Connected with his transactions in this line we give the following
curious anecdotes, which will show that whatever were the defects of
his head, his heart was always in the right place. The Earl of T&mdash;&mdash;,
when a young man, was inordinately addicted to gambling, and in
particular loved to have the King of Bath for his opponent. He was,
however, no match for his majesty, who, after winning several trifling
sums from him, resolved to attempt his cure, foreseeing that otherwise
he would fall a prey to adventurers who might not be so forbearing
as himself. Accordingly he engaged his lordship one evening
in play to a very serious amount, and won from him, first, all his
ready money, then the title-deeds of his estates, and, finally, the very
watch in his pocket and the rings on his fingers. When he had thus
sufficiently punished the young nobleman for his infatuation, Nash
read him a lecture on the flagrant impropriety of attempting to make
money by gambling, when poverty cannot be pleaded in justification
of such conduct; after which he returned him all his winnings, merely
exacting from him a promise that he would never play again! Not
less generously did he behave to an Oxford student who had come
to spend the long vacation at Bath. This greenhorn, who also affected
to be a gamester, was lucky enough to win a large sum of
money from our Beau, and after the game was ended, was invited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
him to supper. "Perhaps," said Nash, "you think I have asked you
for the purpose of securing my revenge; but I can assure you that
my sole motive in requesting your company is, to set you on your
guard, and to entreat you to be warned by my experience, and shun
play as you would the devil. This is strange advice for one like me
to give; but I feel for your youth and inexperience, and am convinced
that if you do not stop where you now are, you will infallibly
be ruined." Nash was right. A few nights afterwards, having lost
his entire fortune at the gaming-table, the young man blew his brains
out!</p>

<p>Though it was one of Nash's foibles to be thought "a lady-killer,"
yet this did not prevent him from befriending the fair sex whenever
opportunity offered. He was the means of exposing many a scheming
libertine, and more than one heiress owed to him her escape from the
snares of penniless adventurers. About the time of the treaty of
Utrecht, a certain Colonel M&mdash;&mdash;, a gallant, handsome officer of dragoons,
was in great favour with all the Bath ladies. As, however, he
had nothing to depend on but his pay, it was an object with him to
marry for money; and accordingly he singled out a Miss L&mdash;&mdash;, a
wealthy heiress, whose father was desirous that she should espouse
a nobleman of distinction. But the colonel had gained her affections;
whereupon Nash, who was well acquainted with his circumstances,
wrote to the young lady's parents, advising them strongly to put an
end to the connexion, which they did, by abruptly removing her from
Bath. The disappointed suitor, enraged at the Beau's interference,
instantly sent him a challenge, which was declined; for, among other
of his prejudices, Nash held the <i lang="it" xml:lang="fr">monomachia</i> or <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">duello</i> in the most unequivocal
abhorrence. Finding his only chance of retrieving his
finances thus cut off, the colonel quitted Bath, where his creditors
were become quite clamorous, and in a fit of desperation hurried over
to the Continent, and joined the Dutch army in Flanders. Here he
enlisted himself as a volunteer; while his friends, not hearing of or
from him for a considerable period, gave out that he had been killed
in battle. Meantime the nobleman, taking advantage of his rival's
absence, pushed his suit with ardour; but, before he could bring it to
a satisfactory conclusion, the young lady's father died, leaving her
property to the amount of fifteen hundred pounds <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i>! It
was at this crisis of her fate that Nash happened to hear that the
colonel had returned to England, but, fearful of being discovered by
his creditors, had changed his name, joined a company of strolling
actors, and was then playing at Peterborough. On learning these
particulars, our Beau thought that the time was come for him to make
reparation to the colonel, especially as the lady was now of age, and
fully competent to make her own choice of a husband. He invites
her accordingly to join him and some mutual friends in a short trip
to Peterborough, where they arrive early in the forenoon, and, by
way of passing the evening agreeably, pay a visit to the theatre.
Just as they are entering the box, the colonel appears on the stage.
The young lady recognises him in an instant, and is so much affected
by his altered circumstances, that she faints away. On regaining
consciousness, she finds him standing beside her. Nash has brought
him there. "You thought me your enemy," said the kind-hearted
monarch, "but I was no such thing; I merely thought one of you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
too extravagant, and the other too inexperienced, to be likely to
make a happy match of it. But the case is altered now; if, therefore,
you feel inclined to marry, do so in God's name, and d&mdash;n him,
say I, that would part you!" They were married within the month,
and Nash spent many a pleasant day at their villa in the neighbourhood
of Bristol.</p>

<p>Mr. Wood, the architect, of Bath, has left on record another anecdote
of Nash, which redounds equally to his credit. About the period
of his greatest popularity, there came to the city a young lady
well known by the name of Sylvia, who, as she was handsome, accomplished,
of "gentle blood," and possessed of a large fortune, soon became
one of the ruling belles of the day. Among the number of this
lady's admirers was a gentleman, nicknamed by his friends the "Good-natured
Man," from his easy and indolent temper. He was of sadly
improvident habits; and having contracted heavy debts, which he
was wholly unable to discharge, he was arrested and thrown into
prison, which coming to the ears of Sylvia, she went to consult Mr.
Nash upon the best means of freeing him from his embarrassments.
His majesty strongly endeavoured to persuade her from interfering in
the matter; observing that her interference would be sure to be misconstrued,
and that to evince such extreme interest in a young man
who had no claim on her consideration further than having occasionally
flirted with her in society, would expose her to the cruellest
calumnies; and, moreover, that she could do him no good, for that
her entire fortune, ample as it was, would be scarcely sufficient to
satisfy the demands of his creditors. The thoughtless and enamoured
girl listened to, but was not convinced by, Nash's arguments. She
expended a large portion of her property in defraying the "Good-natured
Man's" debts; but before she could accomplish his liberation
he died, and she had the mortification to discover that she had not
only lost the greatest part of her fortune, but, which was of more
value, her reputation also. In this forlorn condition, her spirits broken,
and her society avoided by those who had formerly been proud to
rank themselves among her flatterers, she accepted the offer of a
plausible old demirep, who kept one of the most splendid gaming
establishments at Bath, to pay an occasional visit to her rooms, for
the hag was shrewd enough to foresee that Sylvia's beauty would
prove a powerful magnet of attraction to the libertines who frequented
such places. Here Nash used often to meet her, and, believing that
she was still innocent, however thoughtless her conduct might be,
remonstrated with her in the kindest terms, and at length succeeded
in persuading her to take up her residence with Mr. Wood's family
in Queen Square. While here, Mr. Wood describes her as having
been most exemplary in her habits, seldom going out, but confining
herself to the solitude of her chamber, where she spent the greatest
portion of her time in reading. About a month after she had been
domesticated in his house, business of importance took her host to
London; and it was during his absence that Sylvia first meditated
the idea of suicide. One evening, after having been more than usually
cheerful, and amused herself by dandling one of Mr. Wood's
children in her arms, she ordered supper to be got ready in the library,
and, having spent some hours alone there, went up into her
bed-room. On her way, she had to pass through the chamber where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
her host's children lay asleep, and struck with their happy, innocent
countenances, and the consciousness of her own meditated guilt, she
burst into tears; but, recovering herself with an effort, hurried into
her own apartment, carefully locking the door behind her. She then
proceeded to dress herself in white like a bride's-maid, neatly arranged
her hair, and, having procured a pink silk girdle, which she lengthened
by means of another made of gold thread, placed it on the table, and,
throwing herself on the bed, spent some time in reading. About
midnight she rose, and, after kneeling for a few minutes in prayer,
mounted upon a chair, drove a large nail into the closet-door, and,
attaching one end of the girdle to it, fastened the other tightly about
her neck, and so hung suspended. Her weight, however, proving too
much for it, the girdle broke, and she fell to the floor with violence;
but, still resolute to destroy herself, she made a second attempt, in
which she unfortunately succeeded. Her death created an extraordinary
sensation throughout Bath; the coroner's jury brought in a
verdict of lunacy; and Nash, who, with Mr. Wood, was the only
friend the poor girl had left, attended her funeral, and did his best
to protect her memory from insult.</p>

<p>In the year 1734 Bath was honoured by a visit from the Prince of
Orange, and in 1738 by another from the Prince of Wales, both of
whom took particular notice of Nash; for which, in return, the grateful
Beau erected obelisks in their honour. He had now attained the
climax of his popularity. His word was law; his bow an honour; his
acquaintance a sure passport into the best circles. The Prince of
Wales having made him a present of a magnificent gold snuff-box,
the rest of the nobility thought it incumbent on them to follow the
example; and, accordingly, it soon became the fashion&mdash;a fashion
which he most disinterestedly encouraged&mdash;to give Nash snuff-boxes.
As if this were not sufficient distinction, the corporation, in a paroxysm
of gratitude for the benefits which he had conferred on their
city, determined on erecting a full-length statue of him in the Pump-room,
between the busts of Newton and Pope, which gave rise to one
of Lord Chesterfield's wittiest and most caustic epigrams. We subjoin
the closing stanza of this brilliant gem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'The statue, placed the busts between,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">Adds to the satire strength;</div>
<div class="verse">Wisdom and Wit are little seen,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">But Folly's at full length,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Poor Nash's brains were half-turned by such brilliant prosperity.
He had his levees, where he affected all the airs of a legitimate monarch;
his buffoons, his parasites, and even his poet-laureate. But,
so far was he from being satisfied with the flatteries constantly lavished
on him, that his appetite "grew by what it fed upon." If a
beggar in the street called him "Your honour," he always bowed low
to the compliment; but if he called him "Your lordship," he would
give him every farthing he had about him. He has even been known,
when in London, to stand a whole day at the window of the Smyrna
Coffee-house, merely in the hope of receiving a passing bow from the
Prince of Wales or the Duchess of Marlborough!</p>

<p>The numerous dedications to Nash are not the least curious proofs
of his universal celebrity. Some of these are such exquisite samples
of the servile, that we cannot resist the temptation of extracting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
sentence or two from them. One is from a noted highwayman, who
was taken up for attempting to rob and murder a Dr. Handcock.
This scamp, whose name was Baxter, published a book, dated from
Taunton jail, exposing the tricks of thieves and gamblers, which he
dedicated to Nash, as follows: "As your honour's wisdom, humanity,
and interest, are the friend of the virtuous, I make bold to lay at
your honour's feet the following work," &amp;c. Another dedication is
from a professor of cookery, who says, "As much as the oak exceeds
the bramble, so do you, honoured sir, exceed the rest of mankind in
benevolence, charity, and every other virtue that adorns, ennobles,
and refines the human species. I have, therefore, made bold to prefix
your name, though without your permission, to the following
volume, which stands in need of such a patron." We next find a
musical composer essaying the complimentary. "To whom," asks
this sycophantic dedicator, "could I presume to offer these, my first
attempts at musical composition, but to the great encourager of all polite
arts; for your generosity knows no bounds, nor are you more
famed for that dignity of mind which ennobles and gives a grace to
every part of your conduct, than for that humanity and beneficence,
which make you the friend and benefactor of all mankind!" These
dedications, and a hundred others of the same calibre, which might
have turned the stomach of an ostrich, Nash digested with uncommon
facility. But it was with the flatteries of the poets that he used to
be most tickled; and many a hungry browser on Parnassus has been
rescued by his thirst for praise from the fangs of an unimaginative
bailiff.</p>

<p>But the hour was at hand when this Wolsey of the fashionable
world was doomed to experience the caprice and neglect of those circles
whom he had so long ruled with despotic authority. His sun
had attained its meridian, and was already journeying westward. Intoxicated
with self-conceit, and firmly persuaded that he was the first
man of the age, he began to lay aside those magic arts of address to
which he owed all his success; became morose and fidgety; and
took a pleasure in speaking unpleasant truths, which he mistook for
wit. He was, besides, getting fast on in years; and age, which
brings wisdom to some, to men like Nash is apt to bring nothing but
petulance and imbecility. But he was not splenetic without reason;
for his fortune, which he had never husbanded, diminished rapidly,
and he had no earthly means left of recruiting it. His greatest
grievance, however, was the gradual dropping off of his old friends
the nobility, who, it is said, exerted all their influence with the corporation
of Bath to get him superannuated, and Quin, the actor, appointed
Master of the Ceremonies in his stead. This unparalleled ingratitude,
as he called it, stung Nash to the quick, and he threatened
to take his revenge of a degenerate aristocracy by writing his memoirs!
His intention, however, was never carried into effect; which
is a pity, for, judging by the few scraps of composition he left behind,
his book would have been a literary phænomenon of the first
water.</p>

<p>Nash was now become a confirmed old dotard; nevertheless, he still
aped the character of a young beau,&mdash;still continued to haunt like a
spectre the scenes of his departed glory. Though the snows of
eighty-six winters were whitening on his head, it was still his proudest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
ambition to "settle the fashion of a lady's cap," and assign her
her proper station in a country-dance. This, which, to say the worst
of it, was but harmless drivelling, roused against him the pious wrath
of the more straight-laced among the Somersetshire clergy, who
pelted him with the most minaceous pamphlets; exhorted him to quit
the assembly-room for the church, and to repent of those colossal
enormities of which they charitably took for granted he had been
guilty. One of these clerical pamphleteers addressed him in the following
indulgent terms: "Repent! repent! or wretched will you be,
silly, vain old man, to eternity! The blood of souls will be laid to
your charge; God's jealousy, like a consuming flame, will smoke
against you, as you yourself will see in that day when the mountains
shall quake, and the hills melt, and the earth be burned up at his
presence." Another says, "God will bring you to judgment. He
sees me now I write; he will observe you while you read. He
notes down my words; he will also note down your consequent procedure.
Not then upon me, not upon me, but upon your own soul
will the neglecting or despising my sayings turn." How different
these fanatical fulminations from the honied flatteries, in the shape of
poems and dedications, on which Nash's vanity had been so long
fed!</p>

<p>The poor old man was now hourly decaying; but this quite as
much from grief as age. The season of snuff-boxes was over; the
great had altogether forgotten him; and he was preserved from
utter penury solely by the munificence of the Bath corporation, who
granted him ten guineas the first Monday of every month. For some
weeks previous to his decease it was evident that his last hour was at
hand; but he himself would never admit it. He clung to life with all
the tenacity of a Johnson; and roundly asserted that he was in robust
health at the very moment when he was treading, with palsied head
and tottering limbs, on the threshold of the grave. At length his exhausted
powers wholly gave way, and he expired in the eighty-seventh
year of his age, at his house in St. John's Court, Bath, in the
spring of 1761.</p>

<p>No sooner was his death known than the press teemed with tributes
to his memory. The Muses were called on to lament the
eclipse of the brightest luminary of the age; and epitaphs were written
on him,&mdash;one in Latin, and another in English,&mdash;by two of the
most accomplished scholars in the kingdom. That in Latin, by Dr.
King, is a fine sample of mock-solemnity, comparing Nash, as a legislator,
with Solon and Lycurgus, and giving him the preference to
both. But, in his own capital, the sensation occasioned by our Beau's
decease was unexampled. The very day after, the corporation, with
the mayor at their head, met in full and solemn conclave, and voted
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nem. con.</i> fifty pounds towards defraying their monarch's funeral expenses.
The corpse lay four days in state; after which it was conveyed
to the Abbey Church, in the midst of one of the greatest
crowds that had ever assembled in Bath. The following week, the
principal local journal commented on the mournful event as follows:
"Sorrow sate on every face, and even children lisped that their sovereign
was no more. The peasant discontinued his toil; the ox
rested from the plough; all nature seemed to sympathise with our
loss; and&mdash;the muffled bells rung a peal of bob-major!" It must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
confessed, to our shame, that we have no such newspaper writing as
this now-a-days. We have become as unimaginative as steam-engines,
and no longer indulge in those astounding bursts of eloquence
and sensibility which used to electrify our grandfathers and grandmothers.</p>

<p>In person Nash was large and awkward, with harsh, strong, and irregular
features. Nevertheless, he was popular with women, and
not unsuccessful as a gallant; for he dressed showily, had some wit,
abundance of small talk, and was by no means encumbered with modesty.
He used frequently to say of himself, that he was, "like
Nestor, a man of three generations." The Beau of his youth, he
would observe, was stiff, solemn, and formal to a degree; visiting his
mistress, as Jupiter visited Semele, in state; toasting her on bended
knees; and languishing, a timid suppliant, at her feet, by the hour
together. The Beau of his manhood was just the reverse; being a
pert, grinning, lively chatterbox,&mdash;such as we meet with in Congreve's
comedies; ready for any absurd, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i> display of sentiment;
and deeming it an exalted proof of gallantry to eat "a pair of his
idol's shoes tossed up in a fricassee." The Beau of his old age was a
still more extraordinary character, for his whole secret in intrigue
consisted in perfect indifference. If his mistress honoured him with
her approbation, well; if not, she might let it alone. He had no notion
of breaking his heart for love. Women were as plentiful as
mushrooms, and always to be had for the asking. Nash was a great
theorist on all matters of sentiment. It was a favourite maxim with
him that good-humour and fine clothes were enough to ruin a nunnery;
but that "flummery," or the art of saying nothings, was worth
them both put together. Women, he used to say, dote upon lively
nonsense; always talk to them, therefore, in the language they best
understand. The instant you begin to converse rationally with them
the game is up, which is the reason why learned men make such indifferent
lovers.</p>

<p>Next to his powers of gallantry, Nash piqued himself on his wit.
But he was by no means remarkable for this quality, though never
did mortal man labour harder to say good things. His best jokes
were always cracked unawares. The majority of them are well known
to the world, for Smollett, with the coolest effrontery, has transferred
them, unacknowledged, into his own novels. We will, however, give
one or two of them. Meeting one morning, in the Pump-room, a
lady who was deformed, Nash asked her where she came from. Her
reply was, "Straight from London." "Then, madam," replied the
Beau, "you must have been confoundedly warped by the way." Doctor
Cheney, on some occasion having recommended to him a vegetable
diet, he tartly observed, "I suppose you would have me go
grazing and eating thistles like Nebuchadnezzar!" "No, no," said
the doctor, who was also a wag, "there needs no such metamorphosis;
your ears are quite long enough already." Being once confined
to his house by sickness, the same physician drew up a prescription
for him, and, calling on his patient next day, found him up and well.
"I'm glad you had the good sense to follow my prescription, Mr.
Nash," quoth the leech. "Follow it!" exclaimed the other. "Egad,
if I had, I should have broke my neck, for I flung it out of my bed-room
window." We are not without our suspicions that this last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
witticism is a regular Joe Miller, for we have detected it in at least
a dozen different publications. But this is not to be wondered at, for
your good joke is the greatest of travellers. The "facetiæ" of the
old Greek wag, Hierocles, have been naturalised in every language of
Europe.</p>

<p>Though convivial in his youth, yet, for the greatest portion of his
life, Nash was rigidly abstemious in his habits. He loved plain
dishes, seldom remained long at table, and usually contented himself
with two glasses of wine. But he liked to see his friends enjoy
themselves, and would encourage them in these elegant and emphatic
terms: "Eat, gentlemen,&mdash;eat and drink, in God's name; spare,
and the devil choke you!" His favourite meal was supper; and so
fond was he of potatoes, which he called the English pine-apple, that
he used to eat them, like fruit, after dinner. He was also remarkable
for his love of early rising, being seldom in bed after four in summer,
and five in winter. His generosity and benevolence were unbounded.
He gave away enormous sums in charity, and founded a
hospital at Bath, the expenses of which for a time almost beggared
him. Though he had a great respect for rank, yet he discouraged
anything like aristocratic assumption; and, whenever he heard a
young lord boasting of his family, never failed to put him down with
a sneer. In this respect he resembles the late John Kemble, of
whom it is recorded, that, when dining with the Dukes of Hamilton
and Gordon, who were boasting somewhat ostentatiously of the antiquity
of their blood, he lost all patience, and put an abrupt stop
to their egotism by exclaiming, "D&mdash;n both your bloods; pass the
bottle!" Owing to his frequent intercourse with small poets, Nash
fancied that he was a judge of the art. A volume of Pope, who
was his favourite writer, generally lay on his table, though we question
much whether he ever got beyond the "Rape of the Lock."
This, however, was a production every way calculated to please him;
and, accordingly,&mdash;a rich trait of character,&mdash;he was never weary of
repeating the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Sir Plume, of amber <em>snuff-box</em> justly vain,</div>
<div class="verse">And the nice conduct of a clouded cane."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Though he had mixed so much with the world, yet Nash was a
man of great simplicity of character. He imagined that others were
as frank and sincere as himself; and, in his connexion with the gambling
establishments at Bath and Tunbridge Wells, never kept an account,
but trusted entirely to the honour of his partners. He was
never married, though he once made proposals to a young lady, whose
parents favoured his suit, for he was then at the summit of his celebrity.
She, however, declined his addresses; but, apprehensive of
her father's indignation, went to Nash, and candidly told him that her
affections were fixed upon another. He immediately sent for his
rival; gave him the lady with his own hand; and reconciled her parents
to the match by settling on her a fortune equal to that which
they proposed to give her. Unfortunately, however, his generosity
was thrown away; for soon after her marriage she ran away with her
footman, and her husband died of grief.</p>

<p>Late in life Nash set up for a teller of good stories, which he would
repeat half-a-dozen times in the same day. As he seldom allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
truth to stand in the way of a point, his anecdotes were sometimes
amusing, despite the "says he's" and "says I's" with which he stuffed
them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usque ad nauseam</i>. The surest way to gain his favour,&mdash;next
to dedicating a work to him,&mdash;was to laugh, in the right place, at his
conceits, and call him an "odd fellow;" for, like the majority of mankind,
he looked upon eccentricity as a sure test of genius. But, indeed,
vanity was his ruling foible. He had numerous other weaknesses;
but this, "like Aaron's serpent, swallowed all the rest." He
considered his office to be the most important in the world, and himself
the greatest man in it. Yet he was not naturally devoid of good
sense; but, having been long accustomed to pursue trifles, his mind
insensibly shrunk to the size of the petty objects on which it was employed.
Even the most frivolous duties of his office he discharged
with the gravest punctiliousness; and, though overflowing with the
milk of human kindness, never forgave a breach of his regulations.
The man might relent; but the Master of the Ceremonies was inexorable!</p>

<p>The influence that Nash had on the social character of his age was
greater than has been generally supposed. Men of far more exalted
pretensions than he have not effected one half the good. He was
the first who promoted a taste for elegant amusements, and an ease of
address, among a people notorious for their anti-gregarious habits, and
reserved and awkward bearing. The disposition for familiar intercourse,
which&mdash;encouraged by his example&mdash;strangers acquired at
Bath and Tunbridge Wells, they carried with them to the metropolis,
and whatever other place they might visit; and thus the whole kingdom
became gradually more refined and social in its character. When
it is borne in mind that Nash laid the foundation of this wholesome
change without any help from birth, fortune, connexions, or superior
intellect; that, with nothing but his good-humour and his address to
support his claims, he reigned the undisputed monarch of the empire
of fashion for upwards of half a century; though we cannot affirm that
he was a great man, it is impossible to deny that he was an extraordinary
one.</p>

<p>Acres is made by Sheridan to say, "The best terms will grow
obsolete." This, every day's experience proves to be true. "What
a shocking bad hat!" "There he goes with his eye out!" and "Flare
up!" were doomed to make way for "Who are you?"&mdash;as "All round
my hat," with the public street vocalists, has been superseded by
"Jump, Jim Crow."</p>

<p>But it may be remarked that popular phrases founded on a well-known
fact have had a longer duration than those which cannot be
proved to have any such origin.</p>

<p>The cry of "<em>Nosey!</em>" at the theatres, when it was wished that the
music should play up, which arose about a century ago in honour of
Mr. Cervetto, whose nasal promontory used to adorn the Drury-lane
orchestra, survived till a very late period, and indeed has hardly yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
fallen into desuetude; and "<em>Grub-street news</em>" is still spoken of by
our elder <em>quidnuncs</em>, though probably they would be puzzled to tell,
not the meaning of the sentence, but how those words came to convey
the meaning they embody.</p>

<p>It has been said that they took their rise from the circumstance
of a set of needy scribblers having established themselves in Grub-street,
a mean narrow passage leading from Chiswell-street to Fore-street,
now dignified with the name of Milton-street, and thence
sending forth fabricated intelligence. This may be true; but still
there was a founder of this hopeful colony, whose name has not been
preserved. It is intended in this paper to fill up the <em>hiatus</em> in history
which has so long been deplored. George Iland appears to have
been the man.</p>

<p>In the early part of the reign of Charles the Second, some very
bold inventions were hazarded, and given to the world duly attested,
with as good a set of signatures appended as Morison's pills can
command now. They somehow attracted the notice of those in authority,
and one of the marvellous narratives launched in the year
1661 was thought worthy to be made the subject of an official investigation.
Some curiosity will be felt to know what sort of a narrative
it could be that received this singular honour. A verbatim copy is
therefore subjoined. The original filled six pages, and was adorned
with a grotesque engraving, which it is hardly worth while to transcribe.
The title-page ran thus:</p>

<span class="smcap">"True and perfect Relation of the terrible Earth-quake,
great Claps of Thunder, and mighty Hail-stones, which
hapned at Hereford, on Tuesday last, the first of this
present October, &amp;c.</span></p>

<p>"Before I mention any further concerning this strange and sudden
Accident, which hath so lately befaln at Hereford, and that this Real
and Authentique Truth may not seem doubtful, I shall put the
Reader hereof in minde to take notice and remember the several
Disasters that hath befaln, not long since, in and about London,
which I need not here to declare, yet none so wonderful or worthy
of observation as this; but let it not seem strange, for we know, and
often read, that the Lord doth sometimes manifest his will unto the
World in Wonders and Signes, thereby in some part to shew his
Omnipotency, and let them know that he is still the Almighty
God, and that he sees and knows all our ways, how slight soever we
make thereof. Then how can we praise him sufficiently, when we
hear of this strange Disaster that did so lately befal at Hereford, in
that he was pleased to keep the like from us here in London, we
being as sinful as any? But he that is all Mighty and all Powerful,
is also all Goodness and all Merciful, whereon depends the best hopes
of all good Christians.</p>

<p>"And now to descend to the subject I was before speaking of,
which was of the violent Tempest, and terrible Earth-quake, &amp;c. that
hapned at Hereford, be pleased to observe the true Relation thereof,
which is thus:</p>

<p>"On Tuesday last, being the first of this present October 1661,
about 2 of the clock after Noon, there hapned a great and violent
storm to arise, to the amazing and astonishing of all the inhabitants.
The first beginning was with a most terrible Winde, which continued
for the space of 2 hours, with such vehemency, that it forced the
Tiles off the Houses, insomuch that none durst come out at their
doors; in the midst of which storm was blown down the Steeple of a
Church, and many brave Houses, the falling whereof hath killed some
persons, but what they are, or whom, we yet know not.</p>

<p>"Then the Air began to be darkned, but, suddenly clearing again,
the people began to look abroad; and so continuing for a while, all
assuredly thought the storm to be over: but contrary to their hopes,
about 6 or 7 of the clock in the evening, their ears were solicited
with unwonted Claps of Thunder; and, more to augment their fear,
presently fell such Hail-stones, that the like was never seen in any
Age before, each Hail-stone being about the bigness of an Egge, which
several gentlemen of quality affirm, here present in London, who certifie
that they destroyed the Cattle in the Field, and did much other
harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then followed a terrible and fearful Earth-quake, which continued
almost for the space of half an hour, which so amazed the inhabitants,
that they thought the last Day had been come; and immediately
appeared a great brightness, as if it had been Noon-day, but
was presently overcast with a Black Cloud, out of which appeared a
perfect Armes and Hands; in the right-hand was grasped a great
broad Sword, and in the left a Cup, or Boul, as they conceived, full
of Blood.</p>

<p>"Having glutted their eyes with amazement, and filled their hearts
with great fear, with beholding these prodigious Apparitions, more to
astonish both them and us, appeared to their eyes a piece of Corn,
ground, ready to mow, and a Sythe lying by, from whence they heard
a most strange and loud voice, which said, 'Woe, woe to thee, and to
the inhabitants thereof, for he cometh that is to come, and ye shall
all see him!'</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of these words, the people made a grievous
cry, as indeed they might, and many Women that were with Child,
through extream fear, fel in travel; but none so wonderful to be
taken notice of, as Mrs. Margaret Pelmore, the Clerk's Wife of the
Town, who, for the space of twenty Weeks, wanting her bodily health,
had sought for cure of the Doctors: This Margaret Pelmore at that
very instant fell in travel, being exceedingly affrighted, and brought
forth 3 Male Children, who had all teeth, and spake as soon as they
were born. The first said, 'The Day is appointed which no Man
can shun.' The second demanded, 'Where would be found sufficient
alive to bury the Dead?' And the third said, 'Where will there
be Corn enough to satisfie the hungry and needy?'</p>

<p>"As soon as they had spoken these words, they all immediately
gave up the Ghost and died, to the great astonishing and amazement
of all present; and the Mother of the said Children doth at this moment
lie Distracted, and raging in such extream manner, that none
can tell, as yet, whether she will live or die!</p>

<p>Such was the experiment then made on public credulity. The
inquiry which has been mentioned is proved to have taken place by
a paper found some years ago in the State Paper Office, attached to
the pamphlet itself, which was marked, "Examina[~c]on of Jo. Jones,"
and dated "20th 8ber, 1661." The examination is reported as
follows:</p>

<p>"This Examinate saith that he had a share in the printing of the

<h3>CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH</h3>

<p class="center f90">RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED
BY NANCY.</p>

<p>The narrow streets and courts at length terminated in a large
open space, scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and
other indications of a cattle-market. Sikes slackened his pace
when they reached this spot, the girl being quite unable to support
any longer the rapid rate at which they had hitherto
walked; and, turning to Oliver, commanded him roughly to
take hold of Nancy's hand.</p>

<p>"Do you hear?" growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and
looked round.</p>

<p>They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers,
and Oliver saw but too plainly that resistance would
be of no avail. He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped
tight in hers.</p>

<p>"Give me the other," said Sikes, seizing Oliver's unoccupied
hand. "Here, Bull's-eye!"</p>

<p>The dog looked up, and growled.</p>

<p>"See here, boy!" said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver's
throat, and uttering a savage oath; "if he speaks ever so soft
a word, hold him! D'ye mind?"</p>

<p>The dog growled again, and, licking his lips, eyed Oliver as
if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without
any unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>"He's as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn't!"
said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious
approval. "Now you know what you've got to expect,
master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon
stop that game. Get on, young 'un!"</p>

<p>Bull's-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually
endearing form of speech, and, giving vent to another
admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.</p>

<p>It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might
have been Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the
contrary. The night was dark and foggy, and it was just beginning
to rain. The lights in the shops could scarcely struggle
through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment, and
shrouded the streets and houses in gloom, rendering the strange
place still stranger in Oliver's eyes, and making his uncertainty
the more dismal and depressing.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>
<p>They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell
struck the hour. With its first stroke his two conductors stopped,
and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound
proceeded.</p>

<p>"Eight o'clock, Bill," said Nancy, when the bell ceased.</p>

<p>"What's the good of telling me that; I can hear, can't I?"
replied Sikes.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether <em>they</em> can hear it," said Nancy.</p>

<p>"Of course they can," replied Sikes. "It was Bartlemy
time when I was shopped, and there warn't a penny trumpet in
the fair as I couldn't hear the squeaking on. Arter I was locked
up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering
old jail so silent, that I could almost have beat my brains out
against the iron plates of the door."</p>

<p>"Poor fellows!" said Nancy, who still had her face turned
towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded. "Oh, Bill,
such fine young chaps as them!"</p>

<p>"Yes; that's all you women think of," answered Sikes.
"Fine young chaps! Well, they're as good as dead; so it
don't much matter."</p>

<p>With this consolation Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising
tendency to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver's wrist more firmly,
told him to step out again.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said the girl: "I wouldn't hurry by, if it
was you that was coming out to be hung the next time eight
o'clock struck, Bill. I'd walk round and round the place till I
dropped, if the snow was on the ground, and I hadn't a shawl
to cover me."</p>

<p>"And what good would that do?" inquired the unsentimental
Mr. Sikes. "Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty
yards of good stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty
mile off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me.
Come on, will you, and don't stand preaching there."</p>

<p>The girl burst into a laugh, drew her shawl more closely
round her, and they walked away. But Oliver felt her hand
tremble; and, looking up in her face as they passed a gas-lamp,
saw that it had turned a deadly white.</p>

<p>They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a
full half-hour, meeting very few people, for it now rained heavily,
and those they did meet appearing from their looks to hold
much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself. At
length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full
of old-clothes shops; and the dog, running forward as if conscious
that there was now no further occasion for his keeping on
guard, stopped before the door of a shop which was closed and
apparently untenanted, for the house was in a ruinous condition,
and upon the door was nailed a board intimating that it was to
let, which looked as if it had hung there for many years.</p>

<p>"All right," said Sikes, looking cautiously about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the
sound of a bell. They crossed to the opposite side of the street,
and stood for a few moments under a lamp. A noise, as if a
sash-window were gently raised, was heard, and soon afterwards
the door softly opened; upon which Mr. Sikes seized the terrified
boy by the collar with very little ceremony, and all three
were quickly inside the house.</p>

<p>The passage was perfectly dark, and they waited while the
person who had let them in, chained and barred the door.</p>

<p>"Anybody here?" inquired Sikes.</p>

<p>"No," replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard
before.</p>

<p>"Is the old 'un here?" asked the robber.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the voice; "and precious down in the mouth
he has been. Won't he be glad to see you? Oh, no."</p>

<p>The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,
seemed familiar to Oliver's ears; but it was impossible to distinguish
even the form of the speaker in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Let's have a glim," said Sikes, "or we shall go breaking
our necks, or treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you
do, that's all."</p>

<p>"Stand still a moment, and I'll get you one," replied the
voice. The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard, and
in another minute the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the
artful Dodger, appeared, bearing in his right hand a tallow
candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick.</p>

<p>The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark
of recognition upon Oliver than a humorous grin; but, turning
away, beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs.
They crossed an empty kitchen, and, opening the door of a low
earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a
small back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, my wig, my wig!" cried Master Charles Bates, from
whose lungs the laughter had proceeded; "here he is! oh, cry,
here he is! Oh, Fagin, look at him; Fagin, do look at him!
I can't bear it; it is such a jolly game, I can't bear it. Hold
me, somebody, while I laugh it out."</p>

<p>With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid
himself flat on the floor, and kicked convulsively for five minutes
in an ecstasy of facetious joy. Then, jumping to his feet, he
snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger, and, advancing to
Oliver, viewed him round and round, while the Jew, taking off
his night-cap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered
boy; the Artful meantime, who was of a rather saturnine
disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered
with business, rifling his pockets with steady assiduity.</p>

<p>"Look at his togs, Fagin!" said Charley, putting the light so
close to Oliver's new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. "Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
at his togs!&mdash;superfine cloth, and the heavy-swell cut! Oh,
my eye, what a game! And his books, too;&mdash;nothing but a
gentleman, Fagin!"</p>

<p>"Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear," said the
Jew, bowing with mock humility. "The Artful shall give you
another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday
one. Why didn't you write, my dear, and say you were coming?&mdash;we'd
have got something warm for supper."</p>

<p>At this, Master Bates roared again, so loud that Fagin himself
relaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful
drew forth the five-pound note at that instant, it is doubtful
whether the sally or the discovery awakened his merriment.</p>

<p>"Hallo! what's that?" inquired Sikes, stepping forward as
the Jew seized the note. "That's mine, Fagin."</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear," said the Jew. "Mine, Bill, mine;
you shall have the books."</p>

<p>"If that ain't mine!" said Sikes, putting on his hat with a
determined air,&mdash;"mine and Nancy's, that is,&mdash;I'll take the
boy back again."</p>

<p>The Jew started, and Oliver started too, though from a very
different cause, for he hoped that the dispute might really end
in his being taken back.</p>

<p>"Come, hand it over, will you?" said Sikes.</p>

<p>"This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?" inquired
the Jew.</p>

<p>"Fair, or not fair," retorted Sikes, "hand it over, I tell you!
Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with
our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping
every young boy as gets grabbed through you? Give it
here, you avaricious old skeleton; give it here!"</p>

<p>With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note
from between the Jew's finger and thumb; and, looking the old
man coolly in the face, folded it up small, and tied it in his
neckerchief.</p>

<p>"That's for our share of the trouble," said Sikes; "and not
half enough, neither. You may keep the books, if you're fond
of reading; and if not, you can sell 'em."</p>

<p>"They're very pretty," said Charley Bates, who with sundry
grimaces had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question;
"beautiful writing, isn't it, Oliver?" and at sight of the
dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master
Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous,
fell into another ecstasy more boisterous than the first.</p>

<p>"They belong to the old gentleman," said Oliver, wringing
his hands,&mdash;"to the good, kind old gentleman who took me into
his house, and had me nursed when I was near dying of the
fever. Oh, pray send them back; send him back the books
and money! Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
send them back! He'll think I stole them;&mdash;the old lady, all of
them that were so kind to me, will think I stole them. Oh, do
have mercy upon me, and send them back!"</p>

<p>With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of
passionate grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew's feet,
and beat his hands together in perfect desperation.</p>

<p>"The boy's right," remarked Fagin, looking covertly round,
and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. "You're
right, Oliver, you're right; they <em>will</em> think you have stolen
'em. Ha! ha!" chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands; "it
couldn't have happened better if we had chosen our time!"</p>

<p>"Of course it couldn't," replied Sikes; "I know'd that, directly
I see him coming through Clerkenwell with the books
under his arm. It's all right enough. They're soft-hearted
psalm-singers, or they wouldn't have took him in at all, and
they'll ask no questions arter him, fear they should be obliged
to prosecute, and so get him lagged. He's safe enough."</p>

<p>Oliver had looked from one to the other while these words
were being spoken, as if he were bewildered and could scarcely
understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he
jumped suddenly to his feet, and tore wildly from the room,
uttering shrieks for help that made the bare old house echo to
the roof.</p>

<p>"Keep back the dog, Bill!" cried Nancy, springing before
the door, and closing it as the Jew and his two pupils darted
out in pursuit; "keep back the dog; he'll tear the boy to
pieces."</p>

<p>"Serve him right!" cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself
from the girl's grasp. "Stand off from me, or I'll split
your skull against the wall!"</p>

<p>"I don't care for that, Bill; I don't care for that," screamed
the girl, struggling violently with the man: "the child shan't
be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first."</p>

<p>"Shan't he!" said Sikes, setting his teeth fiercely. "I'll
soon do that, if you don't keep off."</p>

<p>The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end
of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging
Oliver among them.</p>

<p>"What's the matter here?" said the Jew, looking round.</p>

<p>"The girl's gone mad, I think," replied Sikes savagely.</p>

<p>"No, she hasn't," said Nancy, pale and breathless from the
scuffle; "no, she hasn't, Fagin: don't think it."</p>

<p>"Then keep quiet, will you?" said the Jew with a threatening
look.</p>

<p>"No, I won't do that either," replied Nancy, speaking very
loud. "Come, what do you think of that?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners
and customs of that particular species of humanity to which
Miss Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably certain that it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her at present.
With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he
turned to Oliver.</p>

<p>"So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?" said the
Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner
of the fire-place; "eh?"</p>

<p>Oliver made no reply, but he watched the Jew's motions and
breathed quickly.</p>

<p>"Wanted to get assistance,&mdash;called for the police, did you?"
sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. "We'll cure
you of that, my dear."</p>

<p>The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver's shoulders with the
club, and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing
forward, wrested it from his hand, and flung it into the fire with
a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into
the room.</p>

<p>"I won't stand by and see it done, Fagin," cried the girl.
"You've got the boy, and what more would you have? Let
him be&mdash;let him be, or I shall put that mark on some of you
that will bring me to the gallows before my time!"</p>

<p>The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented
this threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched,
looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber, her face
quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had
gradually worked herself.</p>

<p>"Why, Nancy!" said the Jew in a soothing tone, after a
pause, during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another
in a disconcerted manner, "you&mdash;you're more clever than ever
to-night. Ha! ha! my dear, you are acting beautifully."</p>

<p>"Am I!" said the girl. "Take care I don't overdo it: you
will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in
good time to keep clear of me."</p>

<p>There is something about a roused woman, especially if she
add to all her other strong passions the fierce impulses of recklessness
and despair, which few men like to provoke. The Jew
saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding
the reality of Miss Nancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily
back, a few paces, cast a glance, half-imploring and
half-cowardly, at Sikes, as if to hint that he was the fittest person
to pursue the dialogue.</p>

<p>Mr. Sikes thus mutely appealed to, and possibly feeling his
personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction
of Miss Nancy to reason, gave utterance to about a couple
of score of curses and threats, the rapid delivery of which reflected
great credit on the fertility of his invention. As they
produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were
discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible arguments.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by this?" said Sikes, backing the inquiry
with a very common imprecation concerning the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
beautiful of human features, which, if it were heard above, only
once out of every fifty thousand times it is uttered below, would
render blindness as common a disorder as measles; "what do
you mean by it? Burn my body! do you know who you are,
and what you are?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know all about it," replied the girl, laughing
hysterically, and shaking her head from side to side with a poor
assumption of indifference.</p>

<p>"Well, then, keep quiet," rejoined Sikes with a growl like
that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, "or
I'll quiet you for a good long time to come."</p>

<p>The girl laughed again, even less composedly than before,
and, darting a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and
bit her lip till the blood came.</p>

<p>"You're a nice one," added Sikes, as he surveyed her with
a contemptuous air, "to take up the humane and genteel side!
A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend
of!"</p>

<p>"God Almighty help me, I am!" cried the girl passionately;
"and I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or changed
places with them we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a
hand in bringing him here. He's a thief, a liar, a devil, all
that's bad, from this night forth; isn't that enough for the old
wretch without blows?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Sikes," said the Jew, appealing to him in a
remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were
eagerly attentive to all that passed; "we must have civil words,&mdash;civil
words, Bill!"</p>

<p>"Civil words!" cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to
see. "Civil words, you villain! Yes; you deserve 'em from
me. I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as
this (pointing to Oliver). I have been in the same trade, and
in the same service, for twelve years since; don't you know it?
Speak out! don't you know it?"</p>

<p>"Well, well!" replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification;
"and, if you have, it's your living!"</p>

<p>"Ah, it is!" returned the girl, not speaking, but pouring out
the words in one continuous and vehement scream. "It is my
living, and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and
you're the wretch that drove me to them long ago, and that'll
keep me there day and night, day and night, till I die!"</p>

<p>"I shall do you a mischief!" interposed the Jew, goaded by
these reproaches; "a mischief worse than that, if you say much
more!"</p>

<p>The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress
in a transport of phrensy, made such a rush at the Jew as
would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him,
had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment;
upon which she made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's all right now," said Sikes, laying her down in a corner.
"She's uncommon strong in the arms when she's up in
this way."</p>

<p>The Jew wiped his forehead, and smiled, as if it were a relief
to have the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor
the dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light
than a common occurrence incidental to business.</p>

<p>"It's the worst of having to do with women," said the Jew,
replacing the club; "but they're clever, and we can't get on in
our line without 'em.&mdash;Charley, show Oliver to bed."</p>

<p>"I suppose he'd better not wear his best clothes to-morrow,
Fagin, had he?" inquired Charley Bates.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with
which Charley put the question.</p>

<p>Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission,
took the cleft stick, and led Oliver into an adjacent
kitchen, where there were two or three of the beds on which he
had slept before; and here, with many uncontrollable bursts of
laughter, he produced the identical old suit of clothes which
Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at
Mr. Brownlow's, and the accidental display of which to Fagin
by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue received
of his whereabout.</p>

<p>"Pull off the smart ones," said Charley, "and I'll give 'em
to Fagin to take care of. What fun it is!"</p>

<p>Poor Oliver unwillingly complied; and Master Bates, rolling
up the new clothes under his arm, departed from the room,
leaving Oliver in the dark, and locking the door behind him.</p>

<p>The noise of Charley's laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy,
who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and
perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery,
might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances
than those in which Oliver was placed; but he was sick
and weary, and soon fell sound asleep.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH.</h3>

<p class="center f90">OLIVER'S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO
LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION.</p>

<p>It is the custom on the stage in all good, murderous melodramas,
to present the tragic and the comic scenes in as regular
alternation as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky,
well-cured bacon. The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed
down by fetters and misfortunes; and, in the next scene, his
faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a
comic song. We behold with throbbing bosoms the heroine
in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron, her virtue and her
life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the
one at the cost of the other; and, just as our expectations are
wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
straightway transported to the great hall of the castle, where a
grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body
of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places from church vaults
to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.</p>

<p>Such changes appear absurd; but they are by no means unnatural.
The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to
death-beds, and from mourning weeds to holiday garments, are
not a whit less startling, only there we are busy actors instead
of passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference; the actors
in the mimic life of the theatre are blind to violent transitions
and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before
the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous
and preposterous.</p>

<p>As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time
and place, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but
are by many considered as the great art of authorship,&mdash;an
author's skill in his craft being by such critics chiefly estimated
with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters
at the end of almost every chapter,&mdash;this brief introduction to
the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary. But I
have set it in this place because I am anxious to disclaim at
once the slightest desire to tantalise my readers by leaving
young Oliver Twist in situations of doubt and difficulty, and
then flying off at a tangent to impertinent matters, which
have nothing to do with him. My sole desire is to proceed
straight through this history with all convenient despatch, carrying
my reader along with me if I can, and, if not, leaving
him to take some more pleasant route for a chapter or two,
and join me again afterwards if he will. Indeed, there is so
much to do, that I have no room for digressions, even if I
possessed the inclination; and I merely make this one in order
to set myself quite right with the reader, between whom and
the historian it is essentially necessary that perfect faith should
be kept, and a good understanding preserved. The advantage
of this amicable explanation is, that when I say, as I do now,
that I am going back directly to the town in which Oliver
Twist was born, the reader will at once take it for granted that
I have good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or
I would not ask him to accompany me on any account.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse
gate, and walked, with portly carriage and commanding steps,
up the High-street. He was in the full bloom and pride of
beadleism; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning
sun, and he clutched his cane with all the vigorous tenacity
of health and power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head
high, but this morning it was higher than usual; there was an
abstraction in his eye, and an elevation in his air, which might
have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing
in the beadle's mind, too great for utterance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers
and others who spoke to him deferentially as he passed
along. He merely returned their salutations with a wave of
his hand, and relaxed not in his dignified pace until he reached
the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with a
parish care.</p>

<p>"Drat that beadle!" said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known
impatient shaking at the garden gate. "If it isn't him at this
time in the morning!&mdash;Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its
being you! Well, dear me, it is a pleasure this is! Come into
the parlour, sir, please."</p>

<p>The first sentence was addressed to Susan, and the exclamations
of delight were spoken to Mr. Bumble as the good lady
unlocked the garden gate, and showed him with great attention
and respect into the house.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mann," said Mr. Bumble,&mdash;not sitting upon, or dropping
himself into a seat, as any common jackanapes would, but
letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair,&mdash;"Mrs.
Mann, ma'am, good morning!"</p>

<p>"Well, and good morning to you, sir," replied Mrs. Mann,
with many smiles; "and hoping you find yourself well, sir?"</p>

<p>"So-so, Mrs. Mann," replied the beadle. "A porochial life
is not a bed of roses, Mrs. Mann."</p>

<p>"Ah, that it isn't indeed, Mr. Bumble," rejoined the lady.
And all the infant paupers might have chorused the rejoinder
with great propriety if they had heard it.</p>

<p>"A porochial life, ma'am," continued Mr. Bumble, striking
the table with his cane, "is a life of worry, and vexation, and
hardihood; but all public characters, as I may say, must suffer
prosecution."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant,
raised her hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed.</p>

<p>"Ah! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!" said the beadle.</p>

<p>Finding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again, evidently
to the satisfaction of the public character, who, repressing
a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said,</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mann, I am a going to London."</p>

<p>"Lauk, Mr. Bumble!" said Mrs. Mann, starting back.</p>

<p>"To London, ma'am," resumed the inflexible beadle, "by
coach; I, and two paupers, Mrs. Mann. A legal action is
coming on about a settlement, and the board has appointed me&mdash;me,
Mrs. Mann&mdash;to depose to the matter before the quarter-sessions
at Clerkinwell; and I very much question," added Mr.
Bumble, drawing himself up, "whether the Clerkinwell Sessions
will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have
done with me."</p>

<p>"Oh! you mustn't be too hard upon them, sir," said Mrs.
Mann coaxingly.</p>

<p>"The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
ma'am," replied Mr. Bumble; "and if the Clerkinwell Sessions
find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the
Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank."</p>

<p>There was so much determination and depth of purpose about
the menacing manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself
of these words, that Mrs. Mann appeared quite awed by
them. At length she said,</p>

<p>"You're going by coach, sir? I thought it was always
usual to send them paupers in carts."</p>

<p>"That's when they're ill, Mrs. Mann," said the beadle.
"We put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather,
to prevent their taking cold."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Mann.</p>

<p>"The opposition coach contracts for these two, and takes
them cheap," said Mr. Bumble. "They are both in a very low
state, and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move
'em than to bury 'em,&mdash;that is, if we can throw 'em upon another
parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if they don't
die upon the road to spite us. Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes
again encountered the cocked hat, and he became grave.</p>

<p>"We are forgetting business, ma'am," said the beadle;&mdash;"here
is your porochial stipend for the month."</p>

<p>Wherewith Mr. Bumble produced some silver money, rolled
up in paper, from his pocket-book, and requested a receipt,
which Mrs. Mann wrote.</p>

<p>"It's very much blotted, sir," said the farmer of infants;
"but it's formal enough, I dare say. Thank you, Mr. Bumble,
sir; I am very much obliged to you, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble nodded blandly in acknowledgment of Mrs.
Mann's curtsey, and inquired how the children were.</p>

<p>"Bless their dear little hearts!" said Mrs. Mann with emotion,
"they're as well as can be, the dears! Of course, except
the two that died last week, and little Dick."</p>

<p>"Isn't that boy no better?" inquired Mr. Bumble. Mrs.
Mann shook her head.</p>

<p>"He's a ill-conditioned, vicious, bad-disposed porochial
child that," said Mr. Bumble angrily. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I'll bring him to you in one minute, sir," replied Mrs.
Mann. "Here, you Dick!"</p>

<p>After some calling, Dick was discovered; and having had his
face put under the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann's gown,
he was led into the awful presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.</p>

<p>The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken, and
his eyes large and bright. The scanty parish dress, the livery
of his misery, hung loosely upon his feeble body; and his
young limbs had wasted away like those of an old man.</p>

<p>Such was the little being that stood trembling beneath Mr.
Bumble's glance, not daring to lift his eyes from the floor, and
dreading even to hear the beadle's voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?" said
Mrs. Mann.</p>

<p>The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of
Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, porochial Dick?" inquired
Mr. Bumble with well-timed jocularity.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," replied the child faintly.</p>

<p>"I should think not," said Mrs. Mann, who had of course
laughed very much at Mr. Bumble's exquisite humour. "You
want for nothing, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"I should like&mdash;" faltered the child.</p>

<p>"Hey-day!" interposed Mrs. Mann, "I suppose you're going
to say that you <em>do</em> want for something, now? Why, you little
wretch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!" said the beadle, raising his hand
with a show of authority. "Like what, sir; eh?"</p>

<p>"I should like," faltered the child, "if somebody that can
write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper,
and fold it up, and seal it, and keep it for me after I am laid in
the ground."</p>

<p>"Why, what does the boy mean?" exclaimed Mr. Bumble,
on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had
made some impression, accustomed as he was to such things.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"I should like," said the child, "to leave my dear love to
poor Oliver Twist, and to let him know how often I have sat by
myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark
nights with nobody to help him; and I should like to tell him,"
said the child, pressing his small hands together, and speaking
with great fervour, "that I was glad to die when I was very
young; for, perhaps, if I lived to be a man, and grew old, my
little sister, who is in heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me;
and it would be so much happier if we were both children there
together."</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker from head to foot
with indescribable astonishment, and, turning to his companion,
said, "They're all in one story, Mrs. Mann. That out-dacious
Oliver has demoralised them all!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't have believed it, sir!" said Mrs. Mann, holding
up her hands, and looking malignantly at Dick. "I never see
such a hardened little wretch!"</p>

<p>"Take him away, ma'am!" said Mr. Bumble imperiously.
"This must be stated to the board, Mrs. Mann."</p>

<p>"I hope the gentlemen will understand that it isn't my fault,
sir?" said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.</p>

<p>"They shall understand that, ma'am; they shall be acquainted
with the true state of the case," said Mr. Bumble
pompously. "There; take him away. I can't bear the sight
of him."</p>

<p>Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
and Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself away
to prepare for his journey.</p>

<p>At six o'clock next morning, Mr. Bumble having exchanged
his cocked hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue
great-coat with a cape to it, took his place on the outside of the
coach, accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed,
with whom, in due course of time, he arrived in London,
having experienced no other crosses by the way than those which
originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who
persisted in shivering, and complaining of the cold in a manner
which, Mr. Bumble declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his
head, and made him feel quite uncomfortable, although he had
a great-coat on.</p>

<p>Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night,
Mr. Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach
stopped, and took a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster-sauce,
and porter; putting a glass of hot gin-and-water on the mantel-piece,
he drew his chair to the fire, and, with sundry moral
reflections on the too-prevalent sin of discontent and complaining,
he then composed himself comfortably to read the paper.</p>

<p>The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble's eyes
rested, was the following advertisement.</p>

<p class="center f90">"FIVE GUINEAS REWARD.</p>


<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Whereas</span> a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or
was enticed, on Thursday evening last, from his home at Pentonville,
and has not since been heard of; the above reward will
be paid to any person who will give such information as may
lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to throw
any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is
for many reasons warmly interested."</p>

<p>And then followed a full description of Oliver's dress, person,
appearance, and disappearance, with the name and address of
Mr. Brownlow at full length.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble opened his eyes, read the advertisement slowly
and carefully three several times, and in something more than
five minutes was on his way to Pentonville, having actually in
his excitement left the glass of hot gin-and-water untasted on
the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Brownlow at home?" inquired Mr. Bumble of the
girl who opened the door.</p>

<p>To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but
rather evasive reply of, "I don't know&mdash;where do you come
from?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver's name in explanation
of his errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the
parlour-door, hastened into the passage in a breathless state.</p>

<p>"Come in&mdash;come in," said the old lady: "I knew we should
hear of him. Poor dear! I knew we should,&mdash;I was certain of
it. Bless his heart! I said so all along."</p>

<p>Having said this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
parlour again, and, seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears.
The girl, who was not quite so susceptible, had run up-stairs
meanwhile, and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble
would follow her immediately, which he did.</p>

<p>He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr.
Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and
glasses before them: the latter gentleman eyed him closely, and
at once burst into the exclamation,</p>

<p>"A beadle&mdash;a parish beadle, or I'll eat my head!"</p>

<p>"Pray don't interrupt just now," said Mr. Brownlow. "Take
a seat, will you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble sat himself down, quite confounded by the
oddity of Mr. Grimwig's manner. Mr. Brownlow moved the
lamp so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle's countenance,
and said with a little impatience,</p>

<p>"Now, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?"&mdash;"Yes,
sir," said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>"And you <em>are</em> a beadle, are you not?" inquired Mr. Grimwig.</p>

<p>"I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen," rejoined Mr. Bumble
proudly.</p>

<p>"Of course," observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend. "I
knew he was. His great-coat is a parochial cut, and he looks
a beadle all over."</p>

<p>Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his
friend, and resumed:</p>

<p>"Do you know where this poor boy is now?"</p>

<p>"No more than nobody," replied Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>"Well, what <em>do</em> you know of him?" inquired the old gentleman.
"Speak out, my friend, if you have anything to say.
What do you know of him?"</p>

<p>"You don't happen to know any good of him, do you?" said
Mr. Grimwig caustically, after an attentive perusal of Mr.
Bumble's features.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble caught at the inquiry very quickly, and shook
his head with portentous solemnity.</p>

<p>"You see this?" said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at
Mr. Brownlow.</p>

<p>Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Bumble's pursed-up
countenance, and requested him to communicate what he
knew regarding Oliver, in as few words as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble put down his hat, unbuttoned his coat, folded
his arms, inclined his head in a retrospective manner, and, after
a few moments' reflection, commenced his story.</p>

<p>It would be tedious if given in the beadle's words, occupying
as it did some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and
substance of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low
and vicious parents, who had from his birth displayed no better
qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice, and who had
terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by making
a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
then running away in the night-time from his master's house.
In proof of his really being the person he represented himself,
Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to
town, and, folding his arms again, awaited Mr. Brownlow's observations.</p>

<p>"I fear it is all too true," said the old gentleman sorrowfully,
after looking over the papers. "This is not much for your intelligence;
but I would gladly have given you treble the money,
sir, if it had been favourable to the boy."</p>

<p>It is not at all improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed
with this information at an earlier period of the interview,
he might have imparted a very different colouring to his
little history. It was too late to do it now, however; so he shook
his head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.</p>

<p>Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes,
evidently so much disturbed by the beadle's tale, that even Mr.
Grimwig forbore to vex him further. At length he stopped,
and rang the bell violently.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bedwin," said Mr. Brownlow when the housekeeper
appeared, "that boy, Oliver, is an impostor."</p>

<p>"It can't be, sir; it cannot be," said the old lady energetically.</p>

<p>"I tell you he is," retorted the old gentleman sharply.
"What do you mean by 'can't be'? We have just heard a full
account of him from his birth; and he has been a thorough-paced
little villain all his life."</p>

<p>"I never will believe it, sir," replied the old lady, firmly.</p>

<p>"You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors
and lying story-books," growled Mr. Grimwig. "I knew it all
along. Why didn't you take my advice in the beginning; you
would, if he hadn't had a fever, I suppose,&mdash;eh? He was interesting,
wasn't he? Interesting! Bah!" and Mr. Grimwig
poked the fire with a flourish.</p>

<p>"He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir," retorted Mrs.
Bedwin indignantly. "I know what children are, sir, and have
done these forty years; and people who can't say the same
shouldn't say anything about them&mdash;that's my opinion."</p>

<p>This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor;
but as it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the
old lady tossed her head and smoothed down her apron, preparatory
to another speech, when she was stopped by Mr.
Brownlow.</p>

<p>"Silence!" said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was
far from feeling. "Never let me hear the boy's name again: I
rang to tell you that. Never&mdash;never, on any pretence, mind.
You may leave the room, Mrs. Bedwin. Remember; I am in
earnest."</p>

<p>There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow's that night. Oliver's
sank within him when he thought of his good, kind friends;
but it was well for him that he could not know what they had
heard, or it would have broken outright.</p>

<span class="f60">CONTAINING HIS LAST LOVE.</span></h2>

<p class="center f75">WITH AN ILLUSTRATION BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.</p>


<p>The Countess of Blessington need not be afraid that I shall
interfere with her work in the unhappy tale which I am about to
begin; my scene will be laid in a very different walk of life, and
the lady whose charms have wounded my heart bear no resemblance
whatever to the aristocratic beauties which grace the book of
the Countess. My arrangement ever goes upon an opposite principle
to hers; her elderly gentleman proceeds from first to last, getting
through his fates and fortunes in regular rotation, as if they were so
many letters of the alphabet, from A to Z: I read mine backward, in
the manner of Turks, Jews, and other infidels; for worse than Turk
or Jew have I been treated by the fair sex!</p>

<p>When I confess to being an elderly gentleman, I leave my readers
to their own conjectures as to the precise figure of my age. It is
sufficient to say that I have arrived at the shady side of fifty,&mdash;how
much further, it is unnecessary to add. I have been always what is
called a man in easy circumstances. My father worked hard in industrious
pursuits, and left me, his only son, a tolerably snug thing.
I started in life with some five or six thousand pounds, a good business
as a tobacconist, a large stock-in-trade, excellent credit and connexion,
not a farthing of debt, and no encumbrance in the world. In
fact, I had, one way or another, about a thousand a year, with no
great quantity of trouble. I liked business, and stuck to it; became
respected in my trade and my ward; and have frequently filled the
important office of common-councilman with considerable vigour and
popularity. As I never went into rash speculations, and put by
something every year, my means are now about double what they
were some thirty-five years ago, when Mr. Gayless, sen. departing this
life, left the firm of Gayless, Son, and Company, to my management.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at, that a man in such circumstances
should occasionally allow himself relaxation from his labours. I entered
heartily into all the civic festivities; and, at my snug bachelor's
country-house on Fortress Terrace, Kentish Town, did the thing genteelly
enough every now and then. Many an excursion have I made
up and down the river, to Greenwich, Richmond, Blackwall, &amp;c.;
have spent my summer at Margate, and once went to the Lakes of
Westmoreland. Some of that party proposed to me to go over to see
the Lakes of Killarney; but I had by that time come to years of discretion,
and was not such a fool as to trust myself among the Irish. I
however did go once to Paris, but, not understanding the language, I
did not take much interest in the conversation of the Frenchmen; and
as for talking to English people, why I can do that at home, without
distressing my purse or person.</p>

<p>The younger portion of my fair readers may be anxious to know
what is the personal appearance of him who takes the liberty of addressing
them. I have always noticed that young ladies are very curious
on this point; and it is difficult, if not impossible, to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
them how irrational is their anxiety. It is in vain to quote to them
the venerable maxims of antiquity, such as, "It is not handsome is,
but handsome does," or, "When Poverty enters the door, Love flies
out at the window," or, "All is not gold that glitters," or many more
adages of equal wisdom. It is generally of no avail to dilate upon the
merits of mind and intellect to persons whose thoughts run after
glossy locks and sparkling eyes, and to whose imagination a well-filled
ledger is of secondary importance to a well-tripped quadrille.
In my own knowledge, a young lady of our ward refused to accept
the hand of a thriving bill-broker in Spital-square,&mdash;a highly respectable
middle-aged man, who had made a mint of money by sharp application
to his business,&mdash;and chose a young barrister of the Inner Temple,
whose bill, to my certain knowledge, was refused discount by the
Spital-square broker at twenty-five per cent. I have been assured
by officers in the army that the case has sometimes occurred of girls
in garrison towns preferring an ensign to a major of many years' service;
and I have heard, on authority which I have reason to credit,
of a West-end lady rejecting an actual governor of a colony, on the
ground that he was a withered fellow as old and prosy as her grandfather,&mdash;as
if there was anything disgraceful in that,&mdash;and shortly afterwards
cocking her cap at a penniless dog, because he had romantic
eyes, and wrote rubbish in albums and pocket-books. I
really have no patience with such stuff. Middle-aged ladies are far
less fastidious.</p>

<p>If I must delineate myself, however, here goes. So far from deteriorating
by age, I think I have improved, like Madeira. A miniature
of me, taken in my twenty-first year by an eminent artist who
lived in Gutter-lane, and drew undeniable likenesses at an hour's sitting
for half-a-guinea, forms a great contrast to one by Chalon,
painted much more than twenty years afterward. You really would
never think them to represent the same man, and yet both are extremely
alike. I was in my youth a sallow-faced lad, with hollow
cheeks, immense staring eyes, and long thin sandy hair, plastered to
the side of my head. By the course of living which I have led in the
city, the sallow complexion has been replaced by a durable red, the
lean cheek is now comfortably plumped out, the eyes pursed round
and contracted by substantial layers of fat, and the long hair having
in general taken its departure has left the remainder considerably
improved by the substitution of a floating silver for the soapy red.
Then, my stature, which, like that of many celebrated men of ancient
and modern times, cannot be said to be lofty, gave me somewhat an
air of insignificance when I was thin-gutted and slim; but, when it is
taken in conjunction with the rotundity I have attained in the progress
of time, no one can say that I do not fill a respectable space in
the public eye. I have also conformed to modern fashions; and when
depicted by Chalon in a flowing mantle, with "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jour à gauche</i>" (whatever
that may mean) written under it, I am as grand as an officer of
hussars with his martial cloak about him, and quite as distinct a
thing from the effigy of Mr. M'Dawbs, of Gutter-lane, as the eau de
Portugal which now perfumes my person, is, from the smell of the tobacco
which filled my garments with the odour of the shop when first
I commenced my amorous adventures.</p>

<p>Such was I, and such am I; and I have now said, I think, enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
to introduce me to the public. My story is briefly this:&mdash;On the
23rd of last December, just before the snow, I had occasion to
go on some mercantile business to Edinburgh, and booked myself
at a certain hotel, which must be nameless, for the journey&mdash;then
rendered perilous by the weather. I bade adieu to my friends at
a genial dinner given, on the 22nd, in the coffee-room, where I
cheered their drooping spirits by perpetual bumpers of port, and all
the consolation that my oratory could supply. I urged that travelling
inside, even in Christmas week, in a stage-coach, was nothing nearly
so dangerous as flying in a balloon; that we were not to think of Napoleon's
army perishing in the snows of Russia, but rather of the bark that
carried the fortunes of Cæsar; that great occasions required more than
ordinary exertions; and that the last advices concerning the house of
Screw, Longcut, and Co. in the High-street, rendered it highly probable
that their acceptances would not be met unless I was personally
in Edinburgh within a week. These and other arguments I
urged with an eloquence which, to those who were swallowing my
wine, seemed resistless. Some of my own bagmen, who had for
years travelled in black rappee or Irish blackguard, shag, canaster,
or such commodities, treated the adventure as a matter of smoke;
others, not of such veteran experience, regarded my departure as an
act of rashness not far short of insanity. "To do such a thing," said
my old neighbour, Joe Grabble, candlestick-maker and deputy, "at
your time of life!"</p>

<p>I had swallowed perhaps too much port, and, feeling warmer than
usual, I did not much relish this observation. "At my time of life,
Joe," said I; "what of that? It is not years that make a man younger
or older; it is the spirits, Joe,&mdash;the life, the sprightliness, the air.
There is no such thing now, Joe, as an old man, an elderly man, to
be found anywhere but on the stage. Certainly, if people poke
themselves eternally upon a high stool behind a desk in a murky
counting-house in the city, and wear such an odd quiz of a dress as
you do, they must be accounted old."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Joe, "I am four years younger than you. Don't
you remember how we were together at school at old Muddlehead's,
at the back of Honey-lane-market, in the year seventeen hundred and
eighty-fou&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"There is no need," said I, interrupting him, "of quoting dates.
It is not considered genteel in good society. I do not admit your
statement to be correct."</p>

<p>"I'll prove it from the parish register," said Joe Grabble.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt, Joe," said I; "interrupting is not considered
genteel in good society. I neither admit nor deny your assertion;
but how does that affect my argument? I maintain that in every
particular I am as young as I was thirty years ago."</p>

<p>"And quite as ready to go philandering," said Joe, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Quite," replied I, "or more so. Nay, I venture to say that I
could at this moment make myself as acceptable to that pretty young
woman at the bar, as nine-tenths of the perfumed dandies of the
West-end."</p>

<p>"By your purse, no doubt," said Joe, "if even that would obtain
you common civility."</p>

<p>I was piqued at this; and, under the impulse of the moment and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
wine, I performed the rash act of betting a rump and dozen for the
present company, against five shillings, that she would acknowledge
that I was a man of gaiety and gallantry calculated to win a lady's
heart before I left London, short as was the remaining space. Joe
caught at the bet, and it was booked in a moment. The party broke
up about nine o'clock, and I could not help observing something like a
suppressed horselaugh on their countenances. I confess that, when I
was left alone, I began to repent of my precipitancy.</p>

<p>But faint heart never won fair lady; so, by a series of man&oelig;uvring
with which long practice had rendered me perfect, I fairly, in the
course of an hour, entrenched myself in the bar, and, at about ten
o'clock, was to be found diligently discussing a fragrant remnant of
broiled chicken and mushroom, and hobnobbing with the queen of the
pay department in sundry small glasses of brandy and water, extracted
from the grand reservoir of the tumbler placed before me. So far
all was propitious; but, as Old Nick would have it, in less than ten
minutes the party was joined by a mustachoed fellow, who had come
fresh from fighting&mdash;or pretending to fight&mdash;for Donna Isabella, or
Don Carlos,&mdash;Heaven knows which, (I dare say he didn't,)&mdash;and was
full of Bilboa, and San Sebastian, and Espartero, and Alaix pursuing
Gomez, and Zumalacarregui, and General Evans, and all that style of
talk, for which women have open ears. I am sure that I could have
bought the fellow body and soul&mdash;at least all his property real and
personal&mdash;for fifty pounds; but there he sate, crowing me down
whenever I ventured to edge in a word, by some story of a siege, or
a battle, or a march, ninety-nine hundred parts of his stories being
nothing more nor less than lies. I know I should have been sorry to
have bulled or beared in Spanish on the strength of them; but the
girl (her name is Sarah) swallowed them all with open mouth,
scarcely deigning to cast a look upon me. With mouth equally open,
he swallowed the supper and the brandy for which I was paying;
shutting mine every time I attempted to say a word by asking me
had I ever served abroad. I never was so provoked in my life;
and, when I saw him press her hand, I could have knocked him down,
only that I have no practice in that line, which is sometimes considered
to be doubly hazardous.</p>

<p>I saw little chance of winning my wager, and was in no slight degree
out of temper; but all things, smooth or rough, must have an
end, and at last it was time that we should retire. My Spanish hero
desired to be called at four,&mdash;I don't know why,&mdash;and Sarah said,
with a most fascinating smile,</p>

<p>"You may depend upon 't, sir; for, if there was no one else as
would call you, I'd call you myself."</p>

<p>"Never," said he, kissing her hand, "did Boots appear so beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Devil take you!" muttered I, as I moved up stairs with a rolling
motion; for the perils of the journey, the annoyance of the supper-table,
the anticipation of the lost dinner and unwon lady, aided, perhaps,
by what I had swallowed, tended somewhat to make my footsteps
unsteady.</p>

<p>My mustachoed companion and I were shown into adjacent rooms,
and I fell sulkily asleep. About four o'clock I was aroused by a
knocking, as I at first thought, at my own room, but which I soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
found to be at that of my neighbour. I immediately caught the silver
sound of the voice of Sarah summoning its tenant.</p>

<p>"It's just a-gone the three ke-waters, sir, and you ought to be up."</p>

<p>"I am up already, dear girl," responded a voice from inside, in
tones as soft as the potations at my expense of the preceding night
would permit; "I shall be ready to start in a jiffy."</p>

<p>The words were hardly spoken when I heard him emerging, luggage
in hand, which he seemed to carry with little difficulty.</p>

<p>"Good-b'ye, dear," said he; "forgive this trouble."</p>

<p>"It's none in the least in life, sir," said she.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;god of jealousy!&mdash;he kissed her.</p>

<p>"For shame, sir!" said Sarah. "You mustn't. I never permit it;
never!"</p>

<p>And he kissed her again; on which she, having, I suppose, exhausted
her stock of indignation in the speech already made, offered
no observation. He skipped down stairs, and I heard her say, with a
sigh, "What a nice man!"</p>

<p>The amorous thought rose softly over my mind. "Avaunt!" said I,
"thou green-eyed monster; make way for Cupid, little god of love.
Is my rump and my dozen yet lost? No. As the song says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"When should lovers breathe their vows?</div>
<div class="verse vi2">When should ladies hear them?</div>
<div class="verse">When the dew is on the boughs,</div>
<div class="verse vi2">When none else is near them."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Whether the dew was on the boughs, or not, I could not tell; but it
was certain that none else was near us. With the rapidity of thought
I jumped out of bed, upsetting a jug full of half-frozen water, which
splashed all over, every wretch of an icicle penetrating to my very
marrow, but not cooling the ardour of my love. After knocking my
head in the dark against every object in the room, and cutting my
shins in various places, I at last succeeded in finding my dressing-gown
knee smalls, and slippers, and, so clad, presented myself at the top of
the staircase before the barmaid. She was leaning over the balustrade,
looking down through the deep well after the departing stranger,
whose final exit was announced by the slamming of the gate after
him by the porter. I could not help thinking of Fanny Kemble in
the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet.</p>

<p>She sighed, and I stood forward.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she screamed. "Lor' have mercy upon us! what's this?"</p>

<p>"Be not afraid," said I, "Sarah; I am no ghost."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said she, recovering, "I didn't suppose you were; but I
thought you were a Guy Fawkes."</p>

<p>"No, angelic girl, I am not a Guy Fawkes; another flame is
mine!" and I caught her hand, endeavouring to apply it to my lips.</p>

<p>"Get along, you old&mdash;&mdash;" I am not quite certain what the angelic
Sarah called me; but I think it was a masculine sheep, or a goat.</p>

<p>"Sarah!" said I, "let me press this fair hand to my lips."</p>

<p>Sarah saved me the trouble. She gave me&mdash;not a lady's "slap,"
which we all know is rather an encouragement than otherwise,&mdash;but
a very vigorous, well-planted, scientific blow, which loosened my two
fore-teeth; and then skipped up stairs, shut herself in her room, and
locked the door.</p>

<p>I followed, stumbled up stairs, and approached in the dark towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
the keyhole, whence shone the beams of her candle. I was about
to explain that innocence had nothing to fear from me, when a somewhat
unintelligible scuffling up the stairs was followed by a very
intelligible barking. The house-dog, roused by the commotion,
was abroad,&mdash;an animal more horrid even than the schoolmaster,&mdash;and,
before I could convey a word as to the purity of my intentions,
he had caught me by the calf of the leg so as to make his cursed fangs
meet in my flesh, and bring the blood down into my slippers. I
do not pretend to be Alexander or Julius Cæsar, and I confess that
my first emotion, when the brute let me loose for a moment, and
prepared, with another fierce howl, for a fresh invasion of my personal
comforts, was to fly,&mdash;I had not time to reflect in what direction;
but, as my enemy came from below, it was natural that my flight
should be upwards. Accordingly, up stairs I stumbled as I could,
and the dog after me, barking and snapping every moment, fortunately
without inflicting any further wound. I soon reached the top of
the staircase, and, as further flight was hopeless, I was obliged to
throw myself astride across the balustrade, which was high enough to
prevent him from getting at me without giving himself more inconvenience
than it seems he thought the occasion called for.</p>

<p>Here was a situation for a respectable citizen, tobacconist, and
gallant! The darkness was intense; but I knew by an occasional
snappish bark whenever I ventured to stir, or to make the slightest
noise, that the dog was couching underneath me, ready for a spring.
The thermometer must have been several yards beneath the freezing
point, and I had nothing to guard me from the cold but a night-gown
and shirt. I was barelegged and barefooted, having lost my slippers
in the run. The uneasy seat on which I was perched was as hard
as iron, and colder than ice. I had received various bruises in the
adventures of the last few minutes, but I forgot them in the smarting
pain of my leg, rendered acute to the last degree by exposure to the
frost. And then I knew perfectly well, that, if I did not keep my seat
with the dexterity of a Ducrow, I was exposed by falling on one side
to be mangled by a beast of a dog watching my descent with a malignant
pleasure, and, on the other, to be dashed to pieces by tumbling
down from the top to the bottom of the house. The sufferings
of Mazeppa were nothing compared to mine. He was, at least, safe
from all danger of falling off his unruly steed. They had the humanity
to tie him on.</p>

<p>Here I remained, with my bedroom candle in my hand,&mdash;I don't
know how long, but it seemed an eternity,&mdash;until at length the dog
began to retire by degrees, backwards, like the champion's horse at
the coronation of George the Fourth, keeping his eyes fixed upon me
all the time. I watched him with intense interest as he slowly receded
down the stairs. He stopped a long time peeping over one
stair so that nothing of him was visible but his two great glaring
eyes, and then they disappeared. I listened. He had gone.</p>

<p>I gently descended; cold and wretched as I was, I actually smiled
as I gathered my dressing-gown about me, preparatory to returning
to bed. Hark! He was coming back again, tearing up the stairs
like a wild bull. I caught sight of his eyes. With a violent spring I
caught at and climbed to the top of an old press that stood on the
landing, just as the villanous animal reared himself against it, scratching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
and tearing to get at me, and gnashing his teeth in disappointment.
Such teeth too!</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter?" cried the beauteous Sarah, opening
her chamber door, and putting forth a candle and a nightcap.</p>

<p>"Sarah, my dear!" I exclaimed, "call off the dog, lovely vision!"</p>

<p>"Get along with you!" said Sarah; "and don't call me a lovely
vision, or I'll scream out of my window into the street. It serves
you right!"</p>

<p>"Serves me right, Sarah!" I exclaimed, in a voice which I am
quite certain was very touching. "You'll not leave me here, Sarah;
look, look at this dreadful animal!"</p>

<p>"You're a great deal safer there than anywhere else," said Sarah;
and she drew in her head again, and locked the door, leaving me and
the dog gazing at each other with looks of mutual hatred.</p>

<p>How long I continued in this position I feel it impossible to guess;
It appeared to me rather more than the duration of a whole life. I
was not even soothed by the deep snoring which penetrated from the
sleeping apartment of the fair cause of all my woes, and indicated
that she was in the oblivious land of dreams.</p>

<p>I suppose I should have been compelled to await the coming of daylight,
and the wakening of the household, before my release from my
melancholy situation, if fortune had not so far favoured me as to excite,
by way of diversion, a disturbance below stairs, which called off
my guardian fiend. I never heard a more cheerful sound than that
of his feet trotting down stairs; and, as soon as I ascertained that the
coast was clear, I descended, and tumbled at once into bed, much
annoyed both in mind and body. The genial heat of the blankets,
however, soon produced its natural effect, and I forgot my sorrows in
slumber. When I woke it was broad daylight,&mdash;as broad, I mean, as
daylight condescends to be in December,&mdash;an uneasy sensation
surprised me. Had I missed the coach? Devoting the waiters to
the infernal gods, I put my hand under my pillow for my watch; but
no watch was there. Sleep was completely banished from my eyes,
and I jumped out of bed to make the necessary inquiries; when, to
my additional horror and astonishment, I found my clothes also had
vanished. I rang the bell violently, and summoned the whole <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse
comitatûs</i> of the house, whom I accused, in the loftiest tones, of misdemeanors
of all descriptions. In return, I was asked who and what I
was, and what brought me there; and one of the waiters suggested
an instant search of the room, as he had shrewd suspicions that I was
the man with the carpet-bag, who went about robbing hotels. After
a scene of much tumult, the appearance of Boots at last cut the knot.
I was, it seems, "No. 12, wot was to ha' gone by the Edenbry coach
at six o'clock that morning, but wot had changed somehow into No.
11, wot went at four."</p>

<p>"And why," said I, "didn't you knock at No. 12?"</p>

<p>"So I did," said Boots; "I knocked fit to wake the dead, and, as
there warn't no answer, I didn't like to wake the living; I didn't
knock no more, 'specially as Sarah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What of Sarah?" I asked in haste.</p>

<p>"&mdash;'Specially as Sarah was going by at the time, and told me not
to disturb you, for she knowd you had been uneasy in the night, and
wanted a rest in the morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>"I waited for no further explanation, but rushed to my room, and
dressed myself as fast as I could, casting many a rueful glance on my
dilapidated countenance, and many a reflection equally rueful on the
adventures of the night.</p>

<p>My place was lost, and the money I paid for it; that was certain:
but going to Edinburgh was indispensable. I proceeded, therefore,
to book myself again; and, on doing so, found Joe Grabble in
the coffee-room talking to Sarah. He had returned, like Paul Pry,
in quest of his umbrella, or something else he had forgotten the night
before, and I arrived just in time to hear him ask if I was off. The
reply was by no means flattering to my vanity.</p>

<p>"I do not know nothink about him," said the indignant damsel,
"except that, whether he's off or on, he's a nasty old willin."</p>

<p>"Hey-day, Peter!" exclaimed Joe. "So you are not gone? What
is this Sarah says about you?"</p>

<p>"May I explain," said I, approaching her with a bow, "fair
Sarah?"</p>

<p>"I don't want your conversation at no price," was the reply.
"You're an old wretch as I wouldn't touch with a pair of tongs!"</p>

<p>"Hey-day!" cried Joe. "This is not precisely the character you
expected. The rump and dozen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the subject is too painful to be pursued. My misfortunes were,
however, not yet at an end. I started that evening by the mail.
We had not got twenty miles from town when the snow-storm began.
I was one of its victims. The mail stuck somewhere in Yorkshire,
where we were snowed up and half starved for four days, and succeeded
only after a thousand perils, the details of which may be read
most pathetically related in the newspapers of the period, in reaching
our destination. When there, I lost little time in repairing to our agent,&mdash;a
W.S. of the name of M'Cracken,&mdash;who has a handsome flat in
Nicholson-street, not far from the College. He welcomed me cordially;
but there was something dolorous in his tone, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Sit ye down, Master Gayless; sit ye down, and tak' a glass o'
wine; it wull do ye guid after yer lang and cauld journey. I hae
been looking for ye for some days."</p>

<p>"What about the house of Screw and Longcut?" I inquired, with
much anxiety.</p>

<p>"I am vera sorry to say, naething guid."</p>

<p>"Failed?"</p>

<p>"Why, jest that; they cam' down three days ago. They struggled
an' struggled, but it wad no do."</p>

<p>"What is the state of their affairs?"</p>

<p>"Oh! bad&mdash;bad&mdash;saxpence in the pund forby. But, why were
you no here by the cotch o' whilk ye advised me. That cotch
cam' in safe eneuch; and it puzzled me quite to see yer name bookit
in the waybill, an' ye no come. I did no ken what to do. I suppose
some accident detained you?"</p>

<p>"It was indeed an accident," replied I faintly, laying down my untasted
glass.</p>

<p>"I hope it's of nae consequence elsewhere," said M'Cracken,
"because it is unco unlucky <em>here</em>; for if ye had been in E'nbro' on
the Saturday, I think&mdash;indeed I am sure&mdash;that we wad hae squeezed
ten or twelve shillings in the pund out o' them,&mdash;for they were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
hopes o' remittances to keep up; but, when the Monday cam', they
saw the game was gane, and they are now clane dished. So you
see, Mr. Gayless, ye're after the fair."</p>

<p>"After the <em>fair</em>, indeed," said I; for men can pun even in misery.</p>

<p>What my man of business told me, proved to be true. The dividend
will not be sixpence in the pound, and it is more than six hundred
and fifty pounds odd out of my pocket. I had the expense
(including that of a lost place) of a journey to Edinburgh and back
for nothing. I was snowed up on the road, and frozen up on
the top of a staircase. I lost a pair of teeth, and paid the dentist
for another. I was bumped and bruised, bullied by a barmaid, and
hunted by a dog. I paid my rump and dozen amid the never-ending
jokes of those who were eating and drinking them; and
I cannot look forward to the next dog-days without having before
my eyes the horrors of hydrophobia.</p>

<p>Such was my last love!</p>

<h3>CANNON FAMILY.&mdash;JOURNEY TO BOULOGNE.</h3>


<p>When Alexander the Great was gazetted commander-in-chief of
the Macedonian forces, and was concocting the eighteen man&oelig;uvres
at the Horse-guards of that celebrated country; when he was about
fighting Darius, Xerxes, and Porus; when Cæsar was invading Gaul
and Britain; when the Benedictine monks were compiling "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Art de
verifier les dates</i>;" when Sterne was writing Tristram Shandy; when
Burton was anatomizing melancholy; when the companions of Columbus
were puzzling their brains to find out how an egg could stand
on end; when Mrs. Glass was concocting her cookery-book, and
Bayle his dictionary; their minds were as smooth and as calm as a
fish-pond, a milk-bowl, a butter-boat, an oil-cruet, compared with the
speculative and prospective anxieties of all the Cannons as they were
rattled on towards Dover, on their way to the land of promise, where
milk and honey were to be found flowing,&mdash;longevity in apothecaries'
shops,&mdash;modesty purchased at milliners' counters,&mdash;and decorum
taught by opera-dancers. In these Utopian dreams, England was
considered an uninhabitable region of fogs, mists, tyranny, corruption,
consumption, and chilblains; the fate of Nineveh was denounced
on London,&mdash;the modern Babylon; and, had it been burning
from Chelsea bun-house to Aldgate pump, and from the Elephant
and Castle to the Wheatsheaf at Paddington, the Cannons would
not have dared to cast "a lingering look behind them" without
dreading the lot of the Lots.</p>

<p>After their due share of impositions, thanks and curses, maledictions
or valedictions, as they had been "genteel" or "shabby"
with waiters, chambermaids, boots, porters, postilions, and hostlers
on the road, the party arrived at Dover, and of course "put up," or
rather, were "put down," at the Ship. But here fresh reasons
for abhorring England were in store. When the waiters saw the arms
of the Cannons on their panels, and the dragon, and the motto
"<em>Crepo</em>," they all crowded round the travellers; but, like many
apparently good things in this world, the inside of the fruit did
not appear as attractive as its external bloom; and as the Cannons
tumbled out, or jumped out, or rolled out, or staggered out of their
vehicles, with all sorts of parcels and bundles, in brown and whity-brown
paper, and pocket-handkerchiefs of silk and of cotton, without
any of those neat and elegant cases containing all sorts of necessary
articles for travellers in health or in sickness, and which form an
invariable part of fashionable travellers' luggage, the waiters and the
lookers-on seemed to consider the Cannons with looks that, without
much knowledge of physiognomy, might have been interpreted
"These people have no business here." They were reluctantly shown
into a parlour, and to bed-rooms at the top of the house, with the
usual formal apology, "Sorry, ma'am, we can't afford better accommodation;
our house is quite full: the Duke of Scratchenburg and his
suet is just come over from Germany, and the Prince of Hesse Humbuginstein
is hourly looked for. Coming&mdash;going&mdash;coming&mdash;oh, Lord,
what a life! going&mdash;going directly!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cannons were hungry; dinner was ordered <em>immediately</em>. Now
it was the height of presumption&mdash;nay, of impudence&mdash;on the part of
a hungry citizen, without courier or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de chambre</i>, or supporters
to his arms, to make use of such an aristocratic adverb. <em>Immediately</em>
implies servitude, slavery, servility, at the nod of a master,&mdash;ay, and
of an accidental master, an interloper in command. Is a free-born
Englishman to run helter-skelter up and down stairs at the risk of
breaking his neck, to hurry the cook, to expose himself to a forfeit of
one shilling (not being a gentleman) by swearing and cursing in the
teeth of the 19 Geo. 2. c. 21, when the cook tells the officious waiter
not to bother him, or, if the weather is hot and the fire is fierce, bids
him, by a natural association of ideas, to go to h&mdash;; and all this because
an ex-tallow-chandler is hungry, and wants an <em>immediate</em> dinner!
Forbid it, glorious constitution! forbid it, bill of rights!</p>

<p>Old Commodus Cannon pulled the bell until the rope remained in
his hand unconnected with its usual companion; for be it known for
the information of impatient voyagers, that in modest apartments the
said ropes are only attached by slender ties, which give way when
vigorously jerked, that servants may not be disturbed. At last a
waiter, bearing in his knitted brows the apprehension of a miserable
shilling "tip" on departure, came in to inform the party that dinner
would be served as soon as possible, but that the Duke of Scratchenburg
and Prince Hesse Humbuginstein's dinners busied every hand
in the house; but, if the gentlemen <em>chose</em>, there was a hot joint serving
up in the coffee-room.</p>

<p>Cannon was outrageous, and swore that he would go to another
hotel.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly welcome to do so, sir, if you like."</p>

<p>"I'll represent your behaviour to all our friends!" exclaimed Mrs.
Cannon.</p>

<p>"None of our acquaintance shall ever put up in this house," added
Miss Cannon.</p>

<p>"Then, ladies," replied the waiter, with a ludicrous heavy sigh,
"we shall be obliged to shut up shop!"</p>

<p>At last an apology for a dinner was served; beefsteaks, potatoes,
and a gooseberry tart. No oyster sauce!&mdash;the last oyster had been
served to his Grace! No fish!&mdash;the last turbot had been served to
his Serene Highness!</p>

<p>"Your port wine and your sherry are execrable!"</p>

<p>"His Grace thought them excellent."</p>

<p>Cannon was bubbling over, but he philosophized over a glass of
punch; and his family comforted themselves, over a cup of tea, with
the thoughts of their speedy departure from "horrible England."</p>

<p>Peter Cannon complained in the coffee-room of the treatment they
had experienced, and he felt not a little annoyed when his interlocutor,
a perfect stranger, observed that "they would have been much
more comfortable had they put up at a second or third-rate hotel."
They seemed created for wanton insult. Cornelius Cannon strolled
out to inquire if there was anything to be seen in Dover; an insolent
groom told him that, if he would go up to the Castle, he might see
"a <em>rum cannon</em>" that carried a ball to Calais. Had he been a gentleman,
Cornelius must have called him out, for he fancied that the
term "<em>rum cannon</em>" had been a personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning the packet was to sail. Here again fresh outrages
were heaped upon them. They were asked for the keys of
their trunks, to be examined at the custom-house!</p>

<p>"Why, what the deuce do they fancy I can have to export?" exclaimed
Commodus Cannon.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, perhaps it might be some machinery."</p>

<p>There was something wantonly offensive in the insinuation that
a man like Mr. Commodus Cannon should smuggle out a steam-engine,
an improved loom, or a paper-mill, in his luggage! What
could have been the cause of all these indignities? Simply this, as it
was subsequently discovered: Sam Surly, being hungry, and not over
nice, despite a brown and gold-laced red-collared livery, and military
cockade, had gone to the <em>tap</em> to enjoy a pull of half-and-half; and,
unaccustomed to travel, had gone into the kitchen for some "victuals,"
instead of joining the board of the other under-gentlemen in
the house. On the other hand, Sukey Simper, both for the sake of
comfort and economy, had brought with her a bottle of rum, and some
loaf-sugar wrapped up in brown paper, and, having been shown to her
attic quarters, forthwith prepared a potation to refresh herself after
her journey: neither being aware that it is part and parcel of a servant's
duty in a respectable family to run up a heavy score at their
master's expense. Now, Sam Surly had also picked up an old
Yorkshire acquaintance, with whom he repaired to another eating-house,
where, over a bowl of generous <em>humpty-dumpty</em>, Sam was
prevailed upon to take charge of a <em>small parcel</em> of little articles for a
present at Boulogne, and, to avoid paying <em>freight</em>, he was recommended
to conceal the said trifles in his capacious corduroy unmentionables.</p>

<p>As Messrs. Cannons were perambulating the streets of Dover, they
observed sundry gentlemen, some of them lords, wearing sailors'
jackets and hats, and they therefore determined to turn out in a marine
costume; for which purpose they hied to a Jew slop-seller for
their outfit. Mr. Cannon, senior, donned a pea-coatie, with a pair of
ample blue trousers, and a glazed hat with a jaunty riband; while his
sons soon strutted about the town in yacht-club uniforms, with their
hands knowingly thrust in the pockets of their jackets, resplendent
with anchored buttons. They felt satisfied that they had produced
"the desired effect," for every one stared at them as they stalked
along in "rank entire," Commodus Cannon leading the van, and the
ladies&mdash;enraptured at the appearance of the male part of the family&mdash;bringing
up the rear. They were certainly annoyed by the impertinent
observations of the vulgar people, boys and girls, who, with
the usual English bad taste, did not know better,&mdash;who would titter,
and exclaim, "I say, there goes the horse-marines!"</p>

<p>"No, no," cried another; "it's the famous Sea Cook and his sons
wot uncovered the Sandwich Islands!"</p>

<p>"I say, commodore, how are they all in the <em>Fleet</em>?" roared out a
costermonger.</p>

<p>"Poor old gentleman! his eyebrows are worn out, looking out for
squalls through a <em>grating</em>?" said a fourth.</p>

<p>While a boatswain sang out, and whistled in Cannon's ear,</p>

<p>"Yer, yer! man the sides! there's the flying Dutchman coming
on board!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sing out for Captain Yokell, cockswain!" bellowed an impertinent
sailor.</p>

<p>Now, strange to say, these observations, which might have offended
some sensitive persons, highly gratified our travellers. They had
already obtained what they so ardently desired&mdash;<em>notoriety</em>, and had
a chance of seeing their names in <em>print</em>; for, even when a man is
abused and ridiculed, if it is in <em>print</em>, the sting carries with it its own
antidote. He becomes public property; he is something; "There goes
that confounded ass, Mr. Such-a-one! there goes that rum cove, Mr.
What's-his-name!" Then, if he can but get himself caricatured,
he is a made man. Were it not for the gratification derived from
such publicity, would so many people walk, and talk, and dress, or undress,
in the absurd manner we daily witness in our lounges? A certain
lord was honoured with an hebdomadary flare-up by a certain
weekly paper as regularly as church-bells are rung on the sabbath.
It was expected that his lordship would have purchased the editor's
silence,&mdash;absurd expectation! One might as well expect that a jolly
prebend would decline sitting in half-a-dozen stalls at the same time.
No, no; the editor abused on until he was tired of abusing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratis</i>;
when his lordship was so much annoyed that he paid to have scurrilous
articles inserted, forwarded by himself.</p>

<p>Two packets were about starting, a French one and an English
one. The Cannons were resolved to punish their ungrateful countrymen,
and embarked under the colours of France. A numerous
French family were repairing on board; and, as the gentlemen wore
a red riband in their button-holes, our party concluded they were
noblemen. The two families were grouped near each other; and the
French, with their usual condescension, honoured the Cannons with
their countenance, conversing as well as persons scarcely acquainted
with each other's language can conveniently converse.</p>

<p>The morning was fine; but lowering clouds and a white sun would
have induced experienced mariners to expect a fresh breeze. With
great volubility of execrations the Gaul got under weigh, and paddled
on slowly, while the English packet shot by like a dart. The French
captain smiled at this swiftness, and, shrugging up his shoulders, exclaimed,</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ces Anglais! ça n'a pas d'expérience!&mdash;nous verrons tout à
l'heure!</i>" he added, rubbing his hands with delight.</p>

<p>The influence of dress is wonderful. A certain costume seems to
impart to the wearer, ideas pertaining to the class of society which
he then personates. A lawyer's wig and gown make a man fancy
that he could plead, and he regrets that he was not brought up to
the bar. A civilian, who attends a fancy ball in a splendid uniform,
is inspired with courageous ideas, which a free potation of <em>refreshment</em>
fans into a martial ardour. Now the Cannons did truly consider
themselves sailors. The young men walked up and down the
deck boldly, endeavouring to show how they could tread a plank or
a seam on "sea legs" without staggering, although there was no
more motion than under Kew-bridge; and then they would cast a
knowing eye at the compass as they passed the binnacle, to ascertain
if the helmsman steered judiciously, although the compass was as
little known to them as the Koran. Then they would suddenly stop,
and look at the sky; then suck their fingers, and hold them up, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
<em>see</em> which way the wind blew; and, when their cigars were out they
would whistle or hum "<em>Rule Britannia!</em>" or, "<em>You gentlemen of
England, who live at home at ease</em>," while they were lighting other
havannahs.</p>

<p>Old Cannon was equally busy; but he was seated amongst the
ladies, <em>encouraging</em> them against sea-sickness, which he said was all
nonsense, and, if they were <em>very</em> sick, recommended them most particularly
to turn their faces to the wind, and to keep their veils before
them not to <em>see</em> the <em>sea</em>. Then to the French gentlemen he endeavoured
to describe the battles of the Nile and of Trafalgar; and the
Frenchmen of course concluded from his age, language, and appearance,
that he was at least an admiral.</p>

<p>A "<em>cat's-paw</em>," as the sailors call it, had now ruffled the surface
of the water, and the vessel commenced heaving; ere
long, most of the passengers assisted the packet in conjugating the
verb "heave;" when, strange to say, the powers of the pea-jacket
and the anchor-buttons were exhausted, and all the Cannons were
drawn out,&mdash;a broadside of unutterable misery. Old Cannon
roared out "<em>he was a-dying</em>," and begged they would send for a
doctor; and while he was rolling, and twisting, and twining upon
the deck in agony, the cabin-boy was cleansing him with a wet
swab. As to the Miss Cannons, they were assisted below,&mdash;not by
their brothers, who, with dismay in their countenances, were "<em>holding
on</em>" at every thing and every one they could catch, until a sudden
regurgitation made them rush in desperation to the bulwark, with
closed eyes and extended arms. Strange to say, the French gentlemen
were not sick! possibly their red riband was more effectual
than blue jackets; but they indulged their mirth at the expense of
old Cannon, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais, voyez donc, ce pauvre Monsieur de Trafalgar!</i>"</p>

<p>It now was blowing fresh, and, to add to their misery, the paddles,
by some mismanagement of the engineer, got obstructed, and the vessel
was completely water-logged.</p>

<p>The French passengers got frightened, and began shaking old
Cannon, roaring out,</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Trafalgar, à la man&oelig;uvre! à la man&oelig;uvre!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh Lord! oh Lord!" exclaimed the old man in a piteous tone,
"are we arrived?"</p>

<p>"<em>No, sare! we sall all arriver down to de bottom. Mon Dieu!
mon Dieu!</em>"</p>

<p>"<em>Monsieur de Trafalgar, you do see! vat is de matter!</em>" exclaimed
a poor Frenchwoman, who had rolled over him.</p>

<p>The captain swore that it all arose from their having an English
steam-engine, which his owner had insisted upon. Fortunately for
the party, there happened to be an English sailor on board, who had
all the while been sleeping on the bows, and who started at the uproar
and the loud curses of the French crew: every one giving an advice
which no one followed and all contradicted. He jumped down
below, and in a few moments all was right again. When he returned
upon deck, the captain, with a smile of importance, observed,</p>

<p>"<em>I do suppose, sare, dat you have been vere long time in France; dat
is de metod of which we do make use in circonstances similar.</em>"</p>

<p>"<em>Circumstances similar!</em>" exclaimed Jack, as he thrust a quid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
his cheek, "then, why the h&mdash;didn't you do it yourself, you beggar?"
and off he went to roost, as the Frenchman, pale with rage,
muttered a "<em>sacré Godam!</em>"</p>

<p>Soon, however, the harbour of Boulogne was made, and the crowd
of its idle inhabitants were congregated as usual on the pier, to variegate
the sameness of their amusements by the arrival of fresh food
for curiosity and gossip regularly supplied by the packets. Unfortunately
it was low water, and the steamer could not get in; it therefore
became necessary that the passengers should be landed on the
backs of fisherwomen, who are always ready saddled on these occasions
for the carriage of voyagers. Great were the cries and the
shrieks of the Miss Cannons and their mamma when thus mounted;
but old Cannon, recovered from his sickness, seemed quite delighted.
He jumped upon the shoulders of a fat old woman, who staggered
under the weight, with a "'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cré chien, qu'il est lourd!</i>" But Mr. Cannon
was not satisfied with his natural weight, and, wishing to show
the natives that he could ride <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'Anglaise</i>, he stuck his knees in the
sides of his biped steed, and began rising in his saddle, despite the
tottering <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulonnaire</i>, who was roaring out, "'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cré Dieu, Monsieur
l'Anglais! est-ce que vous étes enragé! Nom d'un Dieu! vous
m'ereintes! Ah Jesus, je n'en puis plus!</i>" and, suiting the action
to the word, down she rolled in the mud, pitching her rider head
over heels, amidst convulsive roars of international laughter.</p>

<p>This accident did not halt the cavalcade, and Cannon's affectionate
spouse and children endeavoured in vain to rein in their chargers.
On they trotted until they landed them at the pier, leaving Cannon
in the hands of the fisherwoman, who not only insisted upon her fare
in the most vehement language, but on compensation for the damage
occasioned by her fall, which she justly attributed to his bad riding.</p>

<p>The old gentleman, soused to the skin, was most anxious to reach
some hotel where he could put on dry clothes; but he was in France,&mdash;and
plans of comfort are not of easy execution in that land of
freedom. He was stopped with his whole generation at the custom-house,
where fresh annoyances awaited them. It had never occurred
to him that in pacific times a passport was required, and he had
neglected this necessary measure. In vain he roared out that his
name was Cannon. "Were you the pope's park of artillery," replied
the insolent scrivener of the police, "you must be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en règle</i>." While
this warm discussion was going on, Commodus heard loud shrieks in
a room into which his wife and daughters had been politely pushed.
He asked for admittance in vain, bawling out that they were the
Miss Cannons. It was indeed his astonished young ladies, whom a
custom-house female official insisted upon searching. Another more
terrific alarm shook his nerves; a terrible <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fracas</i> took place at the
door, and he thought he heard the voice of Sam Surly cursing the
entire French nation in the most eloquent Yorkshire dialect. Alas!
it was he; but in what a degraded situation,&mdash;what a disgraceful
condition for a free-born British yeoman! and yet we are at peace
with the Gaul! Sam was stretched upon the ground, surrounded by
what appeared to Cannon to be soldiers, with drawn swords, threatening
his life, while he was emphatically denouncing their limbs. But, oh,
horror! another soldier was pulling off his corduroys in presence of the
multitude; while another, and another, and another were drawing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
of them about two hundred yards of bobbinet! This operation over,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douanier</i> proceeded to draw out a specification, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès verbal</i>,
not only regarding the seizure, but a black eye and a bloody nose that
Sam had inflicted on "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des soldats Français</i>," for which his life alone
could atone; but an English gentleman standing by, assured Cannon
that a napoleon would manage these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">braves</i>, if they had been half
kicked to death. Money settled the business, and all the party proceeded
toward the town, surrounded by a crowd of curious people in
roars of laughter; the male part of the family were swearing most
copiously, the ladies crying most piteously, and Sam Surly offering
to box any one for a pot of porter.</p>

<p>The name of Cannon had passed from mouth to mouth, and had
reached Stubb's corner before the party. This celebrated laboratory
of reputation and crucible of character is simply the front of a circulating
library,&mdash;a very emporium of works of fiction. A group of
idlers were, as usual, assembled at this saluting battery, who loaded
so soon as the approach of what a wag called the <em>battering train</em> was
announced.</p>

<p>This spot proved to the Cannon family a second baptismal fount,
for, as they passed by, they all received cognominations according to
their external appearance, which ever after have stuck to them.
Commodus Cannon, a short, plump, dapper man, was called the
Mortar; Mrs. Cannon, also of respectable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</i>, and of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tournure</i>
between an apple dumpling and a raspberry bolster-pudding,
was named the Howitzer; Miss Molly, a tall slight figure, was favoured
with the appellation of the Culverin; Biddy, a squat
cherub-looking girl, was basely named the Pateraro; Lucy, who
had rather a cast in each eye, which had induced the wits of Muckford
to christen her Miss Wednesday (as they pretended that she
looked both ways to Sunday,)&mdash;Miss Lucy, those pernicious sponsors
called the Swivel; Kitty, a stout, short, beautiful creature, in whose
form graceful undulations made up for length, they nicknamed the
Carronade. The senior of the junior Cannons was a Short Nine;
George, a Four Pounder; Cornelius, a Cohorn; Peter, a Long Six;
and Oliver, a Pétard, the most horrible and degrading patronymic
that could be bestowed upon any poor traveller in France.</p>

<p>At last, after passing under this volley from Fort Stubb, they all
arrived, more dead than alive, at a hotel. Here, to their additional
comfort, they were informed that half of the ladies' things that had
not been made up were seized, or, in other words, made over to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douaniers</i>. Exhausted and despairing, they asked for some soup,
expecting a bowl of mock-turtle or of gravy. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potage de vermicelle</i>
was served up, the sight of which was not very encouraging for digestive
organs just recovering from an inverted peristaltic motion.
Cannon tasted it, and swore it was nothing but "hot water and
worms." Miss Molly told him he ought to be ashamed of himself,
before strangers, not to know wermichelly. Cannon swore
lustily that they might swallow the wormy-jelly themselves, and
asked for some other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potage</i>. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupe maigre</i>, made of sorrel and
chervil, followed. Cannon had scarcely tasted the sour mixture,
when he swore he was poisoned with oxalic acid, and roared out for
a doctor, when he was informed to his utter dismay that all the doctors
in the town had struck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>Doctors strike!&mdash;never heard of such a thing. To be sure, they
may strike a death-blow now and then; but doctors striking was a
new sort of a conspiracy. The French waiters only shrugged up
their shoulders with a "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que voulez vous, monsieur!</i>" a most tantalizing
reply to a man who cannot get anything that he wants.</p>

<p>An English resident in the room explained matters. "We have,
sir," he said, "several British practitioners in this place: many of
them are men of considerable merit; but the learned body have just
been thrown into a revolution by a Scotch physician, a Dr. M'Crusoe.
The usual fee here, is a five-franc piece, or four shillings and twopence
English; a sum so very small that many English are ashamed to
tender it. M'Crusoe therefore proposed to his brethren that they
should claim a higher remuneration."</p>

<p>"Jantlemen," he said, "it's dero-gatory tul the deegnety of a
pheeseecian like huz, who hae received a leeberal eeducation, mare
aspeecially mysel', wha grauduated at Mo-dern Authens, tul accep' sic
a pautry fee as four an' tippence. No maun intertains mare contemp'
for siller than aw do; but the varry least we aught tul expec' is ten
fraunks for day veesits, an' eleven fraunks for nighet calls; fare from
the varry heegh price of oil and caundles, at the varry lowest caulculation,
it costs me mare than ten <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baubees per noctem</i> to keep my
noghcturnal lamp in pro-per trim. An' aw therefore houp in this
deceesion we wull support each eather ho-nestly and leeberally. Aw
need na remind jantlemen of yere erudeetion of the wee bit deformed
body Æsop's fable, o' the bundle o' stucks, or o' the faucees of the
Ro-man leectors, union cone-stitutes straingth. Therefore aw repeat
it, aw trust ye wull enforce this raigulation like men o' indepaindence,
an' conscious of the deegnity o' science."</p>

<p>All the doctors acquiesced in the expediency of his project, and to
that effect signed a resolution, with which M'Crusoe walked off, and
read the document with a loud and audible voice, as sternly as a magistrate
could read the riot act, at Stubb's corner. The indignation
of the community knew no bounds; their wrath foamed and bubbled
like the falls of Niagara; they swore by the heads of Galen and Esculapius
that they would rather die of the pip, expire in all the agonies
of hepatitis, gastritis, enteritis, and all the <em>itises</em> that were ever
known, than give one <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">centime</i> more than five francs; nay, in their
fury, they swore they would throw themselves into the hands of French
doctors, and swallow a gallon of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tisane</i> a day for a fifteen-pence fee;
and hundreds of letters were sent off to Scotland for cheap doctors.</p>

<p>This was what Dr. M'Crusoe wanted: he immediately circulated
himself in every hole and corner to inform the public that,</p>

<p>"In consequence of illeeberality o' ma breethren, under exusting
cercumstaunces, aw feel mysel' called upon by pheelauntropy and humaunity
to tak' whatever ma patients can afford to gie me."</p>

<p>Such was the state of the faculty of Boulogne when Cannon swore
he was poisoned. A French doctor came and ordered him four
grains of tartar emetic in a gallon of hot water; and as French doctors
are very kind and attentive to their patients, acting both as physicians
and nurses, Cannon's attendant had the extreme benevolence
to remain with him until he had not only swallowed, but restored,
every <em>minim</em> of this bounteous potation, which really amounted to the
full capacity that Cannon possessed of containing fluids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether there was anything deleterious or not in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupe à
l'oreille</i>, it is difficult to say; but the ladies were afflicted all night
with what physicians call <em>tormina</em>, and <em>tenesmus</em>, and <em>intus-susceptio</em>,
and <em>iliac passion</em>, and <em>borborygma</em> in their <em>epigastric</em> and their <em>hypochondriac</em>
regions; for all and several of which, the French doctor
duly irrigated them with hot water and syrup of gum, threatening
them with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuirasse de sangsues</i> if they were not better in the morning,
as he said that they all laboured under an <em>entero-epiplo-hydromphalo-gastrite</em>:
while poor Cannon, writhing under the effect of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'eau
émétisée</i> was denounced as being threatened with <em>entero-epiplomphale</em>,
<em>entero-merocèle</em>, <em>entero-sarcocèle</em>, and <em>entero-ischiocèle</em>. Sick as they all
were, they looked upon the native practitioner as a very learned man,
and gladly gave thirty sous <em>a head</em> for so much information, when an
impudent English quack would have asked them ten francs for merely
telling them that they had what is vulgarly called the mulligrubs.</p>

<p>After an intolerable night, Morpheus was shedding his poppies over
the exhausted travellers, when they were all roused by the most alarming
cries; and Miss Lucy Cannon and Molly Cannon were dragged
out of their beds by two French gentlemen, who had just jumped out
of theirs, and, clasped in their arms, were forthwith carried out into
the court-yard.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="linequot">"Tipsy dance and jollity."&mdash;<em>L'Allegro.</em>
</p>

<p>A full hour after Darby's departure I ventured to open the little
dog-eared volume which he had thrown upon my table. The title-page
was a curious specimen of that lingual learning which is so often
to be met with in the remotest districts of Ireland. Gentle
reader, a description of it would only spoil it; I therefore lay it before
you as it appeared to me then, with this slight difference,&mdash;that
the printer informs me he has no <em>letter</em> that can adequately express
or imitate the rustic simplicity, the careless elegance both of the character
and setting up. It was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center f120">THE DARBIAD!</p>

<p class="center f75">A BACCHI-SALTANT EPIC. IN ONE BOOK.<br />
AUCTORE CLAUDICANTE KELLIO.
</p>

<p class="no-indent">Containing an Account of a Great Festival given at "The Three
Blacks," by one Mr. Darby Ryan, on the occasion of his coming into
his Fortune, and all the Songs an' Dances as perform'd there in honor
to him.</p>

<p class="center">Dulce est desipere in loco.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Printed by Mary Brady, X<sup><em>her mark</em></sup>, at the sign of the Cross Quills in Monk's
Lane, opposit the Friary. Price sixpence; and to be had of all Flyin'
Stationers, and Dancin' Masthers.</p>
</div>

<p class="space-above2">I could not but admire the classical taste and ingenuity with which
Mr. Kelly, the author, had Latinized his name. He had read, no
doubt, that Ovid was called Naso from the excessive size of his nose;
and, with a delicacy peculiar to himself, had elegantly concealed
the vulgar cognomen of <em>Lame</em> Kelly,&mdash;by which he was known,&mdash;in
the more pompous-sounding Roman appellation of <em>Claudicante</em>!
<em>Kellio</em>, too, was another "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiosa felicitas</i>;" for, while it was in perfect
accordance with grammatical accuracy, it sounded like an ingenious
anagram of O'Kelly, an ancient Irish name. But, to the
poem itself.</p>


<p class="center f90">INVOCATION.</p>

<div class="verse vi1">Many were met; of sisters, brothers, cousins,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi1">First, Widow Higgins, with her daughters three,</div>

<div class="verse vi1">But (who can read the secret book of Fate?)</div>

<div class="verse">A startled pig&mdash;a young and timorous thing</div>
<div class="verse">That in a puddle had been weltering&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Woke from some rapturous dream, and in its fright</div>
<div class="verse">Rush'd 'tween the nag's forelegs, who, woful sight!</div>
<div class="verse">Employ'd his hinder ones so wondrous well,</div>
<div class="verse">That Widow Higgins, bed, and daughters, fell</div>
<div class="verse">(Alas, my muse!) into the porker's bath!</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, day turn'd night! oh, pleasure sour'd to wrath!</div>

<p>[I could not help laying the book down at this passage to reflect
whether the imputation of idleness can be justly thrown upon the Irish.
Men who year after year toil through the perils and privations of a
journey into another land for the sake of a few shillings, can scarcely
be termed lazy; and it is to be regretted that some mode of employment
at home is not devised by those in whose power it is to meliorate
and tranquillise their condition.]</p>

<p class="author"><em>Macbeth.</em></p>

<p>We left Lord Eustace Dash in his gallant frigate, with the prize in
company, running down into the gulf of Genoa, and a strange sail in
sight. His lordship swept the horizon with his glass till his keen
eye caught the desired object in the field, and in an instant he was as
fixed and stationary as a statue. The moon was rising, and her
glorious light shone upon the distant sails, which looked like a silver
speck on the dark zone of the horizon. Intense and eager was the
gaze of the noble captain, and breathless attention pervaded every
individual on the forecastle; even old Savage, the boatswain, suffered
his rattan to be motionless, and the tongue of Jack Sheavehole was
still. At length Lord Eustace raised himself from his recumbent
position; every ear was awaiting the announcement of the stranger's
character; the boatswain approached his commander rather nearer
than etiquette allowed, so eager was he to obtain the information.
"Mr. Sinnitt!" said his lordship, and old Savage opened his mouth
as well as his ears to catch all that would be uttered. "Mr. Sinnitt!"
repeated his lordship; and, that officer's response being heard, the important
communication would next be made. "Mr. Sinnitt, trim
sails in chase," said the captain, and walked aft to resume his station
near the taffrail.</p>

<p>"Now that's what I calls onprincipled," uttered the boatswain, in
a low tone, to his mate: "here we are, rambadgering right down
somewhere away to the back of November, in chase of the Flying
Dutchman, I supposes: but whether yon's she or not may I be
bamfoozled into a kettle-drummer if I know, and the skipper arn't
never got the politeness to inform us. Well, the sarvice is going
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trim sails!" shouted Mr. Sinnitt, from the quarter-deck; and
then was heard the twittering of Jack Sheavehole's pipe, and a rattling
of ropes as the braces were hauled in, the tacks and sheets arranged,
till every square inch of canvass performed its own especial
and proper duty. Lord Eustace hailed the Hippolito to continue her
course, though the Spankaway should do otherwise; and then rejoined
Citizen Captain Begaud, who still retained his position, apparently
abstracted from all that was passing around him.</p>

<p>"I have another hour to spare, Monsieur," said his lordship; "your
star, as you call it, is certainly none of the brightest to-night, and I
own I am desirous of hearing the finish of your narrative. Will you
favour me by proceeding?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will, my lord," returned the Frenchman; "and I am the more
inclined to do so, from a presentiment that hangs over me that my
days&mdash;ay, even my hours&mdash;are numbered. How, when, or where
the fatal blow may be given, or whether by friend or foe, I cannot
even conjecture; but still I am convinced of the fact, and wish to disburthen
my mind before my departure."</p>

<p>"Such presentiments are unworthy a brave man," said Lord Eustace.
"You shall dine with me in Plymouth, Captain Begaud. I
fancy you take the loss of your frigate too much to heart, though you
may be well excused doing so. You fought her nobly, and that rascally
first-lieutenant of yours, merits a hangman's noose, though I
have cause to thank him; but, there, d&mdash;it! a coward is my utter abhorrence.
Come, come, Monsieur! your nation is not proverbial for
despondency. You will marry the countess yet,&mdash;that is, if she be not
already your wife."</p>

<p>A thrilling shudder passed over the Frenchman's frame. "Never,
never!" exclaimed he, with startling vehemence, as he covered his
eyes with his hands, as if to shut out some terrific vision. "No, no,
my lord!&mdash;no,&mdash;it is past,&mdash;it is gone! Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;hell itself
lends me its laugh whenever I think of it!"</p>

<p>There was something so demoniac and unearthly in the agonised
chuckle of the Frenchman, that Lord Eustace turned a penetrating
look upon him, as if he actually expected to see the Prince of Evil by
his side.</p>

<p>"I had no intention of wounding your feelings, Monsieur, and regret
that I have done so," said the generous Englishman.</p>

<p>"I know it; I am well aware of it," responded Begaud. "You
will presently judge for yourself. But, to proceed. After my audience
with Louis the Sixteenth, the grandson of that wretch whose
misdeeds laid the foundation of the revolution; who, if he did not
sanction, at least did nothing to prevent the murder of his own son,
together with his princess; who broke the heart of his queen, and
revelled in abomination&mdash;&mdash;What was the Parc aux Cerfs?&mdash;I have
seen it, Monsieur; I know it all!&mdash;the receptacle for his victims,&mdash;mere
children, whom he taught to read, and write, and pray;&mdash;yet,
horrible depravity! he made them the companions of his disgusting
orgies! Yes; he would nightly kneel with them, and afterwards
carry round the crucifix that they might kiss it; and then selecting&mdash;&mdash;Bah!
my soul sickens at the thought of such a monster! my
heart swells almost to bursting! The daughter of Madame T&mdash;&mdash;
had been there! but I have had my full revenge! Revenge! revenge
on whom? Ay, that's the question; it is a hidden mystery! the
understanding cannot solve it! the innocent suffer for the guilty!</p>

<p>"After leaving the royal presence, fresh apparel was furnished to
me, a chamber and ante-room were set apart for my use, and, on
the morrow, I&mdash;the sworn enemy to the Bourbons! the outcast,
whose parents perished in the fête of 1770! the adorer of the young
Countess de M&mdash;&mdash;, who but a few hours before cherished his affection
in despair!&mdash;I became an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attaché</i> to the household of the
queen,&mdash;though in reality engaged in the confidential service of Monsieur
Calonne. Thus both were exposed to my secret scrutiny; my
star was in the ascendant! I felt the importance of the part I was
called upon to enact; and Fate seemed to be weaving for me a web<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
to catch the royal victims in its trammels!" He drew a convulsive
respiration. "I little thought then, that my own soul would be meshed
in the snares which were laid for others!</p>

<p>"There was something strange in the unusual reliance which M.
Calonne placed upon my fidelity. I was to watch the court party,
who flattered whilst they hated the queen; I was especially instructed
to notice those who had audience of the king: in fact, I engaged
to watch over the interests of my employer by every possible means,
fully convinced that by so doing I should be the better able to promote
my own. You will say this was a dishonourable occupation,
my lord. I grant it; but then, you must remember the bias of my
mind,&mdash;my oath to Madame T&mdash;&mdash;, (which I considered religiously
binding upon my conscience, though she was in all probability numbered
with the dead,)&mdash;and there was, also, the bewitching felicity
of being near to the young countess, whom my very soul ardently
adored.</p>

<p>"The courtiers had raised Calonne from comparative obscurity to
the high and important office which he held; but this they did to
suit their own purposes, not to forward his. But the wily minister
soon ascertained that his position would be scarcely tenable, unless
by some bold stroke the chances should turn in his favour; or else,
by rendering the profligacy of the aristocracy so odious to the people,&mdash;especially
the middle classes,&mdash;that he might fall back upon the
latter, and become their leader. Economy had been the object of his
predecessors, Neckar and Turgot; but Calonne started a new theory,
which he followed up with avidity,&mdash;namely, that profusion best contributed
to, and formed, the wealth of a state. Paradoxical as this
most certainly was, the courtiers could not, or would not, see through
it. They hailed the absurdity with the utmost applause, and henceforth
extravagant profusion became the order of the day, and soon
degenerated into the very extremes of profligacy. The aristocracy
delighted in this, for they bore none of the burthens; and history
will perhaps record that Calonne acted with self-conceit and ignorance.
He did no such thing, my lord; he saw that Neckar, by creating
provincial assemblies, had laid the first stone of a republican form
of government; that the middle classes, though by far the least in
numerical strength, had thereby acquired an influence it was impossible
to control; and therefore, as I said before, he endeavoured to take
advantage of events as they stood, so as to cajole one party whilst he
negociated with the other. Loans were raised to meet the expenditure,
and thus the burthens of the people were increased, the revenue of
four hundred millions of francs was exceeded by at least one hundred
and fifty millions. Complaints, though not loud, were deep. La
Fayette was the leader of the popular cause. He advocated the
rights of human nature, and he was looked up to, with reverence and
esteem. He demanded the convocation of a representative assembly,
and M. Calonne secretly encouraged this demand, that he might be
the better enabled to enforce his schemes upon the nobility for the
payment of the deficit.</p>

<p>"In this emergency, and the more securely to carry out his plans,
the minister proposed to assemble the chiefs of the privileged orders,&mdash;the
Notables: they met at Versailles; Calonne explained the
financial state of the nation, declared the amount of his deficit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
and suggested the necessity of equalising the taxes, and levying them
alike on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i> and the clergy, as well as on the commonalty.
Need I say how distasteful this was to the individuals he addressed?
Need I describe their violent opposition to the proposal, and their determination
to crush the man who had the hardihood to bring it before
them? His enemies were numerous. The pretended friends,
who had elevated him to power to suit their own nefarious arrangements,
now united with his avowed foes; whilst the defalcation
brought him into disrepute with the middle classes, and every engine
was set at work to effect his overthrow. The press, the clergy,
and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i> took the lead; and the fate of Calonne seemed to be
fully decided upon. But, under a show of ostentatious vanity and inflated
ambition, the minister concealed consummate penetration and
skilful tactics. If the Notables had acceded to his wishes, his end
would be answered, and himself continued in power; if they refused,
they involved themselves in an odium which would have due weight
with the adherents of La Fayette, and to them he hoped to be enabled
to look for support when the court should fail him.</p>

<p>"I have been minute, my lord, in these particulars, that you may
the better understand what has yet to come, for it was about this
time that I made my engagement to serve Calonne; and I was not
long in ascertaining that, though apparently the superficial prodigal,
and the frivolous man of fashion, there was yet an energetic boldness
about him that would, if thwarted in his views, urge him to some
deed of desperation. In most instances he behaved to me with the
utmost familiarity; but I strongly suspected that, through some secret
agency of which I was held in ignorance, he kept up a communication
with the disaffected amongst the middle orders; nor was it
long before the fact was fully revealed to me, for the individual who
had been the accustomed means of correspondence was seized with
sudden illness, and negociations were for a time suspended. It was
an anxious and trying period for the minister; he stood upon a pinnacle
from which a powerful party were concentrating all their force
to hurl him, whilst the illness of the agent had separated him from
those who, proud in their republicanism, would not of themselves
seek him, and yet it was from them alone that he now anticipated
succour.</p>

<p>"In his extremity Calonne fixed his attention upon me, and openly
and frankly did he communicate his wishes: his pleasing address
and fascinating manners were at first, however, vainly brought into
play; I suffered them to make but little impression on my mind. To
quit the court,&mdash;where I was in great favour with her majesty,&mdash;and
to leave the presence of her whom my soul so ardently worshipped,
seemed to be a sacrifice of such magnitude, that I felt I had not the
resolution to make it, and therefore I respectfully declined. 'Such,
then, is your resolve?' said the minister. I bowed acquiescence.
'I shall not ask your reasons,' continued he, with a smile of mingling
scorn and pride, 'they are well known to me; but it is right that
you should correctly know the situation in which you are placed. Who
has been the architect of your present prosperity? Mark, young man!
the hand that raised the structure can also prostrate it to the dust.
I have entrusted too much to your keeping, not to make the depository
safe. It is true, I have found you faithful; but, if it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
otherwise&mdash;&mdash;' He paused for a moment, and then rapidly added,
'Young man, there is such a place as the Bastille! there is such an
instrument of execution as the guillotine!' I smiled in defiance, for
threats never produced any other feeling in me. He observed it,
and added, 'It is well your personal courage prompts you to surmount
all apprehensions of either, and induces you to brave the worst; but
reflect!' and his keen eye was fixed upon me: 'the former would
prove a delightful bower for a love-sick youth; there you may in heavy
fetters deplore the harshness of fortune, and curse the hour that saw
you recklessly rend asunder the rosy bonds of Cupid for the iron safeguards
of a stern gailor.' He saw he had touched me, though I strove
to conceal all emotion; and he went on. 'But what will become of
the lovely being whom you worship? Amidst the gaiety and licentiousness
of a court she will soon forget the child of fortune&mdash;Jacques
Begaud! and, though I believe she is not altogether insensible to
your merits, yet the memory of ladies is as evanescent as a flower, it
soon fades away; and other arms will enfold that loveliness in their
embrace! some other head will be pillowed on that fair bosom!
another&mdash;&mdash;' 'Hold!' exclaimed I, affecting an indifference, from a
hope that the secret of my affection was still secure within my own
keeping; 'hold, Monsieur! you are coming to conclusions before you
are aware that you have the slightest ground for them. I am yet
free from&mdash;&mdash;' 'It is now my turn to cry 'hold!'' said he, interrupting
me, and that, too, in a voice and manner that betokened his
full sense of the advantage he had obtained; 'do you imagine, Jacques,
that one so well versed in the workings of human nature as myself
can be easily deceived? Your love for the young Countess de
M&mdash;&mdash;! Ay, that flush of the cheek becomes you! I have seen it
before, young man! Those flashing eyes are traitors to your confidence!
they revealed it to me from the first moment of your entering
the royal closet! Your wandering in the forest,&mdash;the eagerness
with which you complied with my request to attend me to the château,&mdash;the
delight you manifested when first within the walls of the
palace,&mdash;all these I knew must have some actuating motive; nor was
I long in discovering it. Subsequent occurrences have confirmed my
penetration, and&mdash;&mdash;' 'You have not been over-generously employed,
Monsieur,' said I, somewhat humbled.&mdash;'Young man,' 'returned
he, 'bear witness by your own feelings that self-interest is the governing
principle of our actions. Circumstanced as I was, I deemed
it necessary to ensure your services through a more powerful sentiment
than mere gratitude to Monsieur Calonne, and the sequel shows
that I am right. I might command,' continued he proudly, 'and
fear no denial; but I solicit,' he added mildly, and with a smile;
'will you refuse me, Jacques?'&mdash;'You do me too much honour, Monsieur,'
responded I, fully aware that further subterfuge would be
useless; 'I own I love the countess.'&mdash;'And what hope have
you of making her your own, Jacques Begaud?' inquired he eagerly,
but in a tone of mournful commiseration. 'What hope can you
have? Etiquette imposes an impassable barrier between you; what,
then, can break it down?' He paused, and a vague sense of his meaning
crossed my mind. 'What,' continued he,&mdash;'what I ask you is
to annihilate all obstacles, and unite two hearts that fervently affect
each other?' I remained silent. 'To show that I trust you, Jacques,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
I will answer my own question. Popular feeling,&mdash;the popular voice,&mdash;La
Fayette,&mdash;and the representative assembly,&mdash;liberty and equality!
do you understand me now?'&mdash;'I do,' returned I; and, oh! how
often have those very words 'liberty and equality' rung in my ears
since then! they seemed a prophetic intimation of events that afterwards
occurred. I own that I was not really inimical to his proposal,
for my pledge to my injured relative, and my inherent detestation
of monarchy, still retained a powerful influence over my
mind; but I wished, by withholding my acquiescence for a time, to
enhance the value of compliance. How hazardous it is for inexperience
to endeavour to cope with long-practised subtlety! Monsieur
Calonne had read my inmost heart, whilst I foolishly imagined it
was a sealed book! he played a skilful game, and at length, without
quitting the court, (which soon returned to Versailles,) I became
the creature of his will.</p>

<p>"My first attempt at negotiation was to be at the residence of
a celebrated fortune-teller at Paris,&mdash;one who would have been
crushed by the persecution of the clergy, many of her predictions
had been so singularly fulfilled that both the ecclesiastical
and the civil power were afraid to meddle with her; superstitious
awe held them in abeyance, and she triumphed in despite of both.
My embassy was to deliver a packet into her hands, and to receive a
secret communication in reply. I readily found the dwelling, for my
directions were too clear to be mistaken: it was enclosed within a capacious
court-yard, the walls of which were old, and in some parts
dilapidated, but, nevertheless, there was a frowning strength about
them that typified a stern resistance. The house itself was of ancient
structure, with small narrow windows, which seemed more like
loop-holes to a fortification than apertures to admit light and air,
but they were very numerous; and the exterior masonry had been
cut away at an angle of full fifty degrees on each side, so as to command
a tolerably wide range over every part of the court-yard, except
that which lay immediately beneath. There was not, altogether, an appearance
of actual poverty in the exterior; but it rather resembled the
habitation of an ancient family in decay, proud of splendour, yet without
the means of adequately sustaining it. An aged porter admitted me
on my giving a required signal; but, though his years appeared to be
many, there was a piercing keenness in his eyes, at variance with the
silvery whiteness of his hair. His scrutiny was peculiarly searching,
though scarcely more than momentary; and, having satisfied himself,
he preceded me through a long narrow passage, and then up a flight
of stairs, to an apartment rather meanly furnished, where he demanded
my business. I requested an interview with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la sorcière</i>, as it
was only with herself I could communicate. He hesitated; but at
length left me for about a quarter of an hour, and at his return bade
me follow him. I obeyed; and we passed through several rooms, of
no great pretensions as it regarded furniture,&mdash;there was, however,
sufficient in each for use, and every one seemed adapted to receive
different inmates.</p>

<p>"At length we reached the end of a long gallery, and stopped in a
small closet-like place, but well filled with light, and containing numerous
emblems of the divining art of the being who ruled as mistress
of the whole. There were globes of considerable magnitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
diagrams of the heavenly bodies, curious geometrical figures, two
enormous skulls on pedestals, a human skeleton in a glass-case, stuffed
snakes, mirrors that unnaturally enlarged the human features,&mdash;in
short, the place was literally crowded with strange things to attract,
or rather to distract, the attention. Here we lingered a few minutes,
and then a small door was thrown open, into an extremely dark passage
hung with black cloth, and lighted only by a diminutive lamp,
that scarcely sent its feeble rays from one extremity to the other;
the sombre appearance was well calculated to strike terror, and
bewilder the weak minds that traversed its gloom. 'Pass on,'
said my conductor; 'open the farther door! I quit you here.' I
obeyed without hesitation, though I must own that, when I heard the
portal close heavily behind me, and the key harshly grating in the
lock, a sickening sensation crept over my spirit, and I was almost
fainting with the closeness of the place. I pushed on with what haste
I could, and, throwing open the door at the extremity, burst at once
from darkness and gloom into a scene of resplendent brightness that
dazzled the eyes; and, before I could recover my senses, I felt myself
enclosed in the arms of some one who, by her dress, I concluded was
the sibyl herself. Such a greeting appalled me, from its being so totally
unexpected; but a well-remembered voice soon dispelled alarm.
I was in the embrace of my venerable relative,&mdash;she who had influenced
every action of my early life;&mdash;it was Madame T&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>"Need I tell you that I was at once thrown into the very centre of
the vortex of sedition? That this powerful woman, who had gained
an ascendency that was as extensive as it was astonishing, quickly introduced
me to the disaffected of the times, whom she actually ruled
with a despotism they could not counteract? Need I tell you that
my position at court, and the confidential favour of Calonne, were immediately
turned to her advantage, so as to render her more absolute?
She had unbounded wealth at her command, supplied from
the treasury of the Duke d'Orleans; for, whilst she held council with
La Fayette, Mirabeau, and others, the representatives of the middle
classes,&mdash;who, in humbling the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i>, had no idea of abolishing monarchy,&mdash;she
also secretly encouraged the leaders of the mob, several
of whom were sheltered in her house. I will not, however, weary
you with details of politics; suffice it to say that Calonne was thrown
down by those who had elevated him, whilst I retained my station
about the royal person, was gradually raised to honour and trust, and
became the companion, the favoured lover of the young countess.
But the utmost caution was requisite: in public a restrained distance
was preserved, for the purpose of concealment; in the hours
of stolen privacy our very souls were firmly knit together.</p>

<p>"Oh! my lord, it is not possible to tell the commotions which constantly
agitated my mind. I saw the relative whom I had revered
from infancy almost, incessantly engaged in overturning the throne,
and annihilating royalty. She held an unaccountable control over
my actions, and urged me on in the same career with herself; whilst
the innocence of the queen, and my affection for the countess, stirred
up the better feelings of my nature, and prompted me to fly from
Paris. But the noble young lady's attachment to her royal mistress
prevailed over every other sentiment, and she would not leave
the queen. Day by day the crisis gradually approached. I ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
to reason with Madame T&mdash;&mdash;, and was silenced by reproach; had
she used threats we might have been saved. From thenceforth I was
narrowly watched; my position with the countess became known;
and the sibyl of Paris, to my surprise, rather encouraged than opposed
it,&mdash;nay, she bade me look forward, as Calonne had done, to
popular supremacy as most conducive to the happiness I sought.</p>

<p>"The king, weak and fickle, one moment yielding, and the next
annulling his consent, destitute of bold and energetic persons to guide
or to defend him, and practised on by treacherous counsellors, became
little more than a cipher in authority, though a rallying-point
for conspiracy. Monsieur, the revolution had commenced! It called
into action, men of ardent passions and extensive talent. The court,
the Count d'Artois, the Polignacs, could not cope with them. Liberality
gained the ascendency. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i> and the clergy, after
making a show of resistance to popular demands, hurled themselves
into the revolutionary torrent, and were swept away. My detestation
of monarchy had been to my heart like the life-streams that supplied
the channels of existence; yet, when I saw the fated king in his
retirement, amidst his family, with his children on his knees, and the
beautiful white arms of the queen around his neck, compunctious visitings
would swell my breast; for I knew the national assembly which had
been convened was to be the destruction of Louis, and I, on whom
benefits had been showered, was sworn an accessory to his downfall!"</p>

<p>"Really, Citizen Captain," said his lordship, rather warmly, "you
worked the devil's traverse with a vengeance! Upon my word, you
have been a&mdash;ha, hem!&mdash;excuse my English blood. There's something
yet to come; pray proceed. One may gather a useful lesson
even from&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;proceed."</p>

<p>"An impulse I cannot counteract impels me to continue," returned
Begaud proudly, "or, otherwise, my tongue should be silent. If you
are an unwilling listener, my lord, have the politeness to say so; all
that I desire is a hearer, not a judge."</p>

<p>"True, true!" responded Lord Eustace. "I have to apologise for
my warmth. Believe me I am all attention."</p>

<p>"Step by step," continued the French captain, "the revolution
proceeded. The chambers became united,&mdash;not for the purpose of
resisting popular demands, but that by their embrace they might hug
each other, to the death of both. The royal sitting took place; the
assembly insisted on concessions, well knowing that the sceptre was
passing away from the royal grasp; and Louis menaced in return,
being, however, wholly destitute of influence or power to carry his
menaces into operation;&mdash;he was the braggart of the morning, the
shrinking imbecile of sun-set. It was shortly after this that the
Count d'Artois undertook to stop the revolutionary torrent. He
might as well have attempted to control the lightning's forked flash,
or tried to have silenced the rolling of the thunder. Arms were
seized; bloodshed followed. The Bastille&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;the Bastille
came down! the populace triumphed! the physical strength of the
lower orders had developed itself as superior to every other appliance,
and threatened to overwhelm the middle classes, who had stirred up
the ponderous and mighty engine to perpetrate devastation. The
joy of Madame T&mdash;&mdash; became unbounded; but her schemes had not
yet arrived at the full maturity she wished. Her idol, La Fayette, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
is true, was rising to the zenith; but she deceived even him. The
Duke d'Orleans was her prompter; his gold was scattered by her
amongst the mob with a profuse hand; and neither Bailly, (who had
been created mayor of Paris,) La Fayette, nor the leaders of true
liberty, were aware of the extent to which corruption was carried
to further revolutionary designs, and bribe the mob to renewed
sedition.</p>

<p>"Constant in my attendance upon the royal family, I was also assiduous
in my attention to the young countess. Monsieur, if ever
hearts truly loved, those hearts were ours! Yet, apart from each
other, how different were our actions! Hers was all-confiding, fond
attachment and devotion; whilst, at the same time, she persisted in
following and in sharing the fortunes of her royal mistress. I almost
idolized Amelie, and would cheerfully have sacrificed my life
to have preserved hers; but I still retained my deadly hatred to monarchy,
and had registered an oath to work its overthrow. Oh, Monsieur!
had Louis been born in a private station, his amiability would
have gained him the love, the estimation of all; but he was a king,
and it was against the crown the battery was levelled. Had the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i>, had the clergy acquiesced in the reasonable plans at first
proposed, and then stood firm by the throne, the middle classes must
have partially yielded; but they first abandoned their own position,
and then deserted their monarch.</p>

<p>"Mirabeau arose: La Fayette began to doubt his powers to allay
the revolutionary phrensy; he wished to preserve the monarchical
form of government, and opposed the insurrectionary movements
with an armed force; but Mirabeau died, and, according to his own
prediction, the faction soon tore the last shreds of monarchy asunder.
The king attempted to escape; I aided that attempt, Monsieur; and
glad should I have been, had the royal family attained a place of safety!
But the scheme was frustrated, and frustrated by whom? by
Madame T&mdash;&mdash;, whose intelligence, independent of myself, had
placed the fugitives within the power of the Orleanists. Amelie, at
the earnest request of the queen, remained behind, so that the numbers
might not attract notice; but she was at the earliest opportunity
to follow Marie Antoinette. That opportunity never offered itself.
The royal family were brought back to Paris. Petion and
Robespierre clamoured for a republic. In vain Bailly and La Fayette
dyed the Champ de Mars with the blood of democrats. The new
legislative assembly mocked and insulted the monarch. They began
their sitting in puerility; they terminated their decrees in blood!</p>

<p>"The Tuileries was soon afterwards invaded by the mob, and Louis's
head assumed the symbol of revolution; the crown was already crushed,
the red cap had taken its position even upon the monarch's brow;
royalty was no more, and my heart exulted in its annihilation. Still I
pitied the fate of the Bourbons. The people feared them; there seemed
something in the very name of king which stirred up feelings no earthly
power could subdue. The secrecy I had observed with Madame T&mdash;&mdash;
relative to the flight of the royal family had exposed me to suspicion,
and my condemnation would have been sealed but for the timely rescue
of my aged relative, who saved me from assassination; but I no
longer held influence with either party. I exhorted the countess to
fly with me; but the noble and heroic woman remained firm to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
duty, and I determined rather to perish with her than leave her to
the remorseless cruelty of the rabble.</p>

<p>"The northern armies were rapidly marching to the frontiers unresisted.
The prisons of Paris were crowded with royalists, and
such as were suspected of favouring their views; and, as circumstances
had excited a strong feeling against me, I was at length consigned
to the Abbaye; but an emissary of Madame T&mdash;&mdash; assured
me that it was more for security than punishment. Horrible were the
spectacles that daily succeeded each other. The stones of the court-yard
of the Abbaye reddened with the blood of victims till the day of
immolation crowned the demons of revolution with a wreath that hell
itself might envy. I had been called before Maillard, and questioned;
my replies appeared to be satisfactory; I was commanded to act as
secretary to this wholesale murderer. A table was placed in the
court-yard, at which Maillard took his seat, with a knife yet reeking
with blood before him. On either side were arranged about a dozen
of the lowest order of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans culottes</i>, to form the mockery of a tribunal,
whilst near the entrance stood a ruthless band of sanguinary assassins
armed with knives and mallets. The portal was thrown open,
a carriage drove in, and from it alighted an ecclesiastic, his robes
torn and soiled, his face the semblance of despair, his step, as he
descended, feeble,&mdash;for he was aged and weak. His feet touched
the ground, Maillard raised his bloody token, a blow from a mallet
felled him to the earth, the wretches closed upon their victim, and
beat and wounded him till his last convulsive shudder proclaimed that
life was extinct! Another presented himself; but he was young and
active, and he sprang at once into the midst of the assassins, and
stood proudly erect. For the moment the hired tools of vengeance
were appalled; but again the knife was raised, and rage returned
with redoubled energy for having suffered a recoil! Another and
another succeeded as the carriages drove in. Age and infirmity had
their brief career shortened! Youth and strength were cut off in
their prime! The sacred character of priest was no protection; and,
Monsieur, I registered the names of twenty-three ecclesiastics whose
mangled bodies were piled against the wall. There was yet another;
but he was saved almost by miracle, and his preservation is yet to
me unaccountable.</p>

<p>"I will not go over the events of that day. Every being within the
prison was massacred except the women, and one or two who were saved
by their intercession. Goblets of blood&mdash;the blood of aristocrats&mdash;were
handed to daughters and wives, as the test of safety to a parent
or a husband; and the disgusting draughts were swallowed with a
horrid eagerness lest it should be supposed they shrunk from the
task. Monsieur, my very soul sickened. I had hated monarchy;
but I had never contemplated the possibility of such enormities as I
was then compelled to witness. The infuriated beasts of the wildest
forest could not be compared to these hyenas in human form; for,
whereas instinct would lead the first to rend their prey for food
without the ingenuity of torture, the latter called in the aid of human
invention to prolong the sufferings of their victims, for the
purpose of glutting their worst and most baneful passions.</p>

<p>"I was released, and sought the residence of Madame T&mdash;&mdash;; but
I found that even her protection would not avail me. The torrent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
had reached even to her, and she feared being carried away by its
eddies. There was but one alternative,&mdash;a commission in the army
of the North. This was accepted; but, previous to my departure,
(though only a few hours were allowed,) I endeavoured to obtain intelligence
of Amelie. She was in the Temple with her fated mistress,
and I was hurried off to join the Duke de Chartres<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> on the frontiers.
La Fayette was induced to give himself up to the enemy, who erected
the finger of menace before they had power to execute. A manifesto
was published, summoning the Parisians to return to their allegiance,
and, in case of refusal, threatening to deliver them up to military
execution. Bah! Monsieur, it was gasconade! and by whom
was this precious document drawn up? By the very man who had
first set the revolutionary machine in motion, and who now imagined
that the Parisians, having plucked forth the sword and thrown away
the scabbard, were to be terrified by mere threats; it was my old
master, Monsieur Calonne. This act of his, brought the unfortunate
Louis more hurriedly to the scaffold.</p>

<p>"I was present under Dumouriez at Valmy, where the allies, as if
panic-stricken, showed the futility of their threats, for we were victorious.
Conquest succeeded to conquest. The battle of Jemmapes
was fought, and Belgium became ours. It was whilst prosecuting a
hazardous march that intelligence reached me that Louis was no
more. Madame T&mdash;&mdash;'s revenge was satiated; but she herself perished
near the guillotine, an awful instance of fearful retribution.
She had hurried in disguise to the place of slaughter, and obtained a
near approach to the fatal instrument. Her joy at seeing the axe
fall was unbounded; she shrieked with delight, and, being recognised,
was raised upon the shoulders of the women, and in
the madness of the moment was worshipped with enthusiastic fervour:
they bore her along through the swelling crowds, and, amidst
their awe and homage, she cried for fresh victims,&mdash;'The queen! the
queen!' Her shout was reiterated by the mob, in whom the sight of
royal blood had quickened the tiger-like ferocity of their sanguinary
thirst for gore; and they were hurrying towards the prison of the bereaved
wife and wretched mother, when a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garde du corps</i>, in female
attire, fought his way to the head of the procession. He, too, had
witnessed the murder of his royal master; and, terror for his own fate
inspiring him with a desire to fall at once, he formed the determination
to have a companion in his exit. He stood before the shouting
mob, who were compelling every one to do obeisance to their idol;
he stooped down, as if in obedience to their mandate; but, making
a sudden spring, like the panther from his lair, or the snake from his
coil, he gripped the sibyl by the throat, dragged her to the earth,
and stabbed her to the heart! 'Twas the work of an instant; the
sound of her voice had scarcely died away in the distance as she
stirred up the vindictiveness of the populace, when she lay extended
on the frost-bound ground a lifeless corpse. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garde du corps</i> was
instantly seized, and in a short time his dissevered limbs were scattered
through the Place Louis Quinze. Thus terminated the life of
Madame T&mdash;&mdash;, and the queen was spared a little longer.</p>

<p>"Anxious for the security of Amelie, I requested leave of absence,
but it was refused me,&mdash;'my services were required with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
army.' Again, and again, at intervals, I renewed my application,
with no better success; till, goaded by agony, I threw up my commission,
and returned to Paris, where I found Robespierre the leader
of the day. The queen had shared the fate of her royal consort, and
the countess was under condemnation in a dungeon of the Conciergerie.
Maddened and desperate, I sought out Danton, and endeavoured
to enlist him on my side for the preservation of her I loved;
but he had argued himself into cold-blooded policy, and recommended
my abandoning Amelie to her fate. With difficulty I was allowed
an interview with the devoted lady; and, oh! Monsieur, language
cannot describe the bitterness of those moments! Her affection was
unchanged and unsubdued. She was calm and collected, though
there was the prospect of only a few hours' division between her and
eternity. Young and beautiful, though somewhat wasted by distress
and hunger, I could not look upon her resigned and heroic conduct
but as something too valuable for my possession, and only worthy of
that heaven to which she was hastening. We parted; and I left her
with the assurance that no means should be left untried to preserve
her life. I hurried to Robespierre, and met Danton coming out; a
cold sick shuddering rushed through my heart; nevertheless, I entered
the bureau of the tyrant, who commenced a rapid series of questions
relative to the defection of Dumouriez, (who had passed over to
the enemy,) and the state of the army of the North. Repeatedly did
I attempt to introduce the object of my visit, and as often did he
foil me. The insatiate monster! the consummate villain! At length
I obtained a hearing, described my services, promised the most implicit
compliance with every order he might give, provided the life of
the countess was granted me as a boon. 'Her attachment to the queen,'
said he, 'has rendered her conspicuous, and these are not times in
which to suffer the milk of human kindness to overflow the current of
a just retribution.'&mdash;'Her devotion to her mistress ought to excite admiration,
Monsieur Citizen,' returned I; 'but I will answer with my
own existence that henceforth she will cause no trouble, but bend to
the will of the nation.'&mdash;'You promise well,' said he, 'and, did it rest
with me, the pardon might be easily accomplished; but we want recruits
to meet the enemy, and they refuse to join our standard, lest,
during their absence, the aristocrats should again usurp the power,
and revenge themselves on the families and friends of those who are
in the field. Young man, I fear the case is hopeless.'&mdash;'You want
trusty servants, Citizen,' rejoined I,&mdash;'men on whom you can rely
with confidence that they will neither desert nor betray the interests
of the nation. Save the life of this innocent, and you bind me
yours for ever.' He held me for some time in conversation. I entreated,
I implored,&mdash;nay more, I wept! and the drops that were
wrung from my eyes were like boiling and scalding blood rushing
from my heart. He seemed moved to compassion; tears stole down
his cheeks! Bah! the wretch was mocking me! no soft distilment
of generous sympathy was ever wormed from out his breast! 'I
have an important duty for you to execute;' said he, 'perform it with
fidelity, and the pardon shall be granted,'&mdash;'But the time is short,'
remonstrated I; 'Citizen Danton&mdash;&mdash;!' 'You are right,' he answered,
and, hastily snatching a piece of paper, he hurriedly wrote a few
lines, which he presented to me. 'This will stay the execution,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
he added; 'Danton is not to be trusted.'&mdash;'The pardon, Monsieur
Citizen!' exhorted I; 'let me but see her released, and I am yours,
soul and body!'&mdash;'The populace, my friend,' returned he; 'the populace
and Danton! Has she not seduced a brave officer from the
defence of his country? Believe me, she is more safe within the
walls of the Conciergerie than if exposed to popular violence.'&mdash;'As
my wife, Monsieur,' responded I, 'she will immediately return with
me to the army. Grant me her pardon and her liberty, let the rest
fall upon my head.'&mdash;'You are wilful,' said he, somewhat sternly; 'but
take your wish.' Again he wrote, and once more I received a document,
that seemed like renewed light, and hope, and life to me. 'You
will return here,' continued he, 'when your mission is accomplished;
I have business for you. Use despatch now, but do not fail hereafter.'</p>

<p>"With a bold step and a bounding heart I hurried from his presence,
and ran toward the prison. In one of the streets I met a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacre</i> accompanied by the officers of justice, and I knew it was some
poor wretch whose hours were numbered; and, oh! how did my spirit
exult in the thought that Amelie&mdash;my own Amelie&mdash;would be rescued
from a similar fate! I stopped not to ascertain who the condemned
prisoner was; but with my quickest speed presented myself at the
prison gate. I showed my paper, the porter admitted me; and, oh!
Monsieur, what tongue can tell the joyous and eager delight that
held a sainted fête within my breast! In a few minutes I should
hold her within my arms, should clasp her in my embrace, and lead
her forth to freedom. And yet I trembled: the perspiration stood
in big drops upon my face. I felt a sickness steal over me; though
not a fear, not a doubt arose in my mind of Amelie's liberty. The
head gaoler was engaged; but in a time,&mdash;though short, it was an
age to me,&mdash;he came; I delivered the document into his hands; he
read it, shook his head, and, whilst a suffocating sensation almost
stifled every faculty, I heard him say, 'I fear you are too late. Amelie
de M&mdash;&mdash; has already departed for the place of execution!'"</p>

<p>Here vivid recollection appeared to overcome the Frenchman's
strength of mind; he paced the deck athwart-ships with impetuous
strides; the picture of desolation was probably present to his imagination
in all its horrors; and Lord Eustace could not behold his
apparent agony unmoved, but he did not speak, rather preferring to
leave nature to its own operations. In a few minutes the captive
grew more composed; he again placed himself by his lordship's side,
folded his arms, and proceeded.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, she had indeed departed, and was the inmate of
that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacre</i> I had passed on my hurried way to the prison. The truth
instantly flashed upon me; in my disregard for the sufferings of another,
I had consigned her to an ignominious end. I had the pardon
in my hand. I might be her murderer!&mdash;Might be? there was a
hope in that surmise; and, resuming the document, I flew rather than
ran towards the fatal spot. People stared at my headlong speed, and
gave way before me. I saw the guillotine, with the prostituted
figure of Liberty presiding over it. My breath began to fail; but
yet I shouted. There was a commotion in the crowd as I held up the
paper high above my head. I rushed forward. The few persons
who had collected opened a passage, and I reached the scaffold at
the very moment the axe fell, and the decapitated trunk of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
young and beautiful, sent forth its gush of blood to waste the
fountain of life! At first I stood speechless with horror and
amazement; but when the head was raised, and I saw those
tresses I had loved to weave amongst my fingers, stained with gore,&mdash;when
I beheld the cheek that had been pressed to mine still quivering
in the last death-pang,&mdash;phrensy drove reason from her seat.
I raved till the air rang with my maledictions. I cursed the Convention,
and denounced the monsters Robespierre and Danton. The
guard were about to seize my person, when a young man caught
me by the arm, claimed me as his brother, and declared I was a
lunatic, escaped from the control of my keepers. He dragged me
away with him to his lodgings, and, when my fit of passion was
passed, I recognised the youth I had saved from drowning during the
earthquake of Messina.</p>

<p>"That night we quitted Paris together, for he would not suffer me
to remain alone, and despair had fixed a melancholy upon my mind
that rendered all places alike to my despondency. For a time we sojourned
in the country; but my friend received orders to join the
army employed against Toulon, and I accompanied him. He had
been a pupil in the artillery school of Brienne; he was soon raised
to eminence by his skill and judgment, and the whole artillery department
of the army before Toulon was placed at his disposal.
Through his talent and intrepidity Toulon fell; and I obtained by
his recommendation a lucrative office, and ultimately rose through
the several grades to that in which you found me,&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capitaine de frégate</i>.
Monsieur, the youth of Messina, the artillery officer who
snatched me from the myrmidons of Robespierre, is now the First
Consul of the French nation,&mdash;Napoleon Buonaparte!"</p>

<p>Here Citizen Begaud ceased. The chase was closing nearly within
hail, and, without exchanging another word, Lord Eustace walked to
the gangway.</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="A_CHAPTER_ON_WIDOWS" id="A_CHAPTER_ON_WIDOWS"></a>A CHAPTER ON WIDOWS.</h2>


<p>Widows! A very ticklish subject to handle, no doubt; but one on
which a great deal may be said. An interesting subject, too,&mdash;what
more so? What class of persons in the universe so interesting as weed-wearing
women? We are not sure that on paper they have ever been
treated as they deserve. We don't think they have been considered
as they ought to be: their past, their present, and their future, have
not been speculated upon; their position in the world has not been decided.
They have simply been spoken of <em>as</em> widows, in the gross: the
various circumstances of widowhood have never been distinguished; as
if those circumstances did not subdivide and classify, giving peculiar
immunities to some, and fixing peculiar obligations on others; as if
every good woman who has the fortune, or misfortune, to call in an
undertaker, is placed in precisely the same situation as far as society
is concerned, or ought to be judged or guided by the same rules.
We shall begin with a definition; not because any one can doubt
what a widow is, but because we have a reason.</p>

<p>A widow is&mdash;"a woman who has lost her husband." We must
here premise that it is no part of our present plan to say a syllable
about those whose husbands have taken themselves off&mdash;the dear departed,&mdash;and
not been heard of, Heaven knows how long: nor of
those who have lost the affection, and attention, and care of their
husbands; for, however much they may be widows as to the comforts
and endearments of married life, they are not widows for our
purpose.</p>

<p>We shall define a widow in other words. A widow is&mdash;"a woman
whose husband is dead." This would not be sufficiently intelligible
unless we were to add "dead by due course of nature, accident, or
physic," because there is such a thing as a man being dead in law;
and as we have ever carefully eschewed all things pertaining, directly
or indirectly, to that dangerous "essence," as far as volition could
assist us, so we intend to eschew them. We mean, then, dead in fact,
and comfortably buried, or otherwise safely disposed of.</p>

<p>And now, having settled a definition, let us proceed to the division
of our subject.</p>

<p>We propose to treat of young widows, middle-aged widows, and
old widows; to speak of them the truth, and nothing but the truth,
and, if not the whole of it, sufficient we trust to show that they have
merited our attention.</p>

<p>A young widow must be on the tender side of twenty-eight; the
tough side begins, and ten additional years limit, middle-aged widowhood;
while all from thirty-eight to a hundred must take rank, in this
army at least, as granny-dears.</p>

<p>A young widow!&mdash;to what emotions of tenderness and pity do
these words give rise! With what a vivid scene of wretchedness is
the mind oppressed! Do they not tell us a tale&mdash;and how briefly
too!&mdash;of joy and sorrow, rejoicing and wailing?&mdash;happy anticipations
and blighted hopes crowded into one little space? In our mind's
eye, we see a fair and blushing bride, an animated ardent bridegroom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
a group of happy friends, favours, and festivals; in the background of
the picture, a grave. One is missing from the party, never to return;
gone from the light and warmth of love, to the cold but constant
embrace of the tomb,&mdash;from the <em>few living</em> to the <em>many dead</em>!
The atmosphere was sweet, and life-instilling; an arc of promise was
above us: that arc has vanished, that atmosphere has changed,&mdash;it is
thick, oppressive, dank! Hope's lamp flickers, as if it would go out
for ever.</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly the cambric-pocket-handkerchief view of the
matter, making, as some would say, the "devils" very blue indeed;
but it is one that strikes many, perhaps all, who are not of a fishy or
froggy temperament: at the same time, we will admit the brush is
dipped in the darkest colours, and that we might have been a little
less sombre by imagining the defunct a fat and apoplectic old fool,
who had only decided upon going to church when he ought to have
been looking to the church-yard; in which case, "a young widow,"
instead of drawing on the deep wells of the heart, draws upon our
cheerful congratulations, and stands forth "redeemed, regenerated,
and disenthralled by the irresistible genius of universal emancipation."</p>

<p>Whether under the melancholy or the happy circumstances to
which we have alluded, a young widow is a very different being to
what she has ever been before; in identity of person she is the same,
but there is no identity of position; as regards society, there is no
identity of rights, privileges, licences, or liabilities. The great difference
as regards herself is, that, for the first time in her life, she is her
own protector: many things that she could not do as a girl, and dare
not do as a wife, are now open to her. She has been "made a woman
of," and is a very independent person. After languishing a
fitting time in calm retirement and seclusion, having "that within
which passeth outward show," she reappears to the world decked in
"the trappings and the suits of woe." We purposely use the word
"decked," because in its most familiar sense it implies "adorned,"
at least as applied to the "craft" we are now convoying. We
should very much like to be told, and very much like to see, a more
interesting sight than a young widow, when, after having been laid
up in ordinary the ordinary time, she leaves her moorings, in proper
"rig and trim," to prosecute the remainder of the voyage of life.
The black flag is up, and no doubt she means mischief; but all is fair
and above board. No mystery is made of the metal she carries, the
port she is bound for. She may take a prize, or make one; but it
must be by great gallantry if she is captured.</p>

<p>To drop metaphor: a young widow is, we repeat, an extremely
delightful and highly privileged creature. Mark her in society,&mdash;we
do not care how limited or how extensive,&mdash;and she bears the palm in
the interest that is excited. We will give a showy animated girl of
eighteen the benefit of a first appearance; we will allow her to have
excited the attention of the room, to be the observed of all observers;
every one shall be asking, "Who is the young lady in pink crape?"&mdash;she
shall have danced and sung herself into full-blown importance,&mdash;she
shall have turned as many heads as she has times in her waltzing;&mdash;and
then, a little late in the evening, we will introduce, very
quietly,&mdash;no loud double knocking at the door, no voices of servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
echoing her name, no rustling of silks or satins,&mdash;a young widow!
just "one year off;" she shall slide gently into the room, seeming to
shun observation, as they all do, (lest perchance some ill-natured
person should wonder what business they have there,)&mdash;and, contented
with a simple recognition from her host or hostess, she shall occupy
some "silent nook," and rest satisfied in its shade. Presently, some
one shall chance to <em>speak</em> of her as "a young widow,"&mdash;the lady of
the house, for instance, who usually occupies every leisure moment in
informing groups of her old visitors the names and et-ceteras of her
young ones,&mdash;she shall happen to say, "Excuse me one moment, I
<em>must</em> go and speak to poor Mrs. Willow."</p>

<p>"<em>Poor</em> Mrs. Willow!&mdash;what can that mean?" wonder all who
hear it.</p>

<p>And then the lady comes back, and explains that Mrs. W. is a
widow.</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" says one.</p>

<p>"Only think!" says another.</p>

<p>"How very young!" says a third.</p>

<p>"Any children?" asks a fourth.</p>

<p>"I thought she looked melancholy!" observes a fifth; and then,
after staring at the object of their commiseration and curiosity sufficiently
long to be sure they will know her again, they separate with
the view of advertising the interesting intelligence. It being known
to four old women, and one middle-aged man who doesn't dance, it
speedily spreads over the whole room; and, provided no one intimates
off-hand a superior case of affliction in the person of any one present,
the young widow has to bear the brunt of a very wholesale inspection.
There is also a great deal of wonder; people wonder in classes:&mdash;the
elderly, What her husband died of,&mdash;the young ladies, Whether she
has any family,&mdash;the gentlemen, Whether she has any money. During
all this wonderment, "the young lady in pink crape" is entirely
forgotten.</p>

<p>Now, if the young widow should happen to feel at all "at home,"
and chooses to "come out" a little, mark what follows: "the young
lady in pink crape" has to dance the remainder of the evening with
red-haired, freckled, pock-marked, snub-nosed, flat-footed fellows,
with whom she would not have touched gloves an hour ago, while all
the stylish staff that then surrounded her, are doing homage at another
shrine.</p>

<p>And no wonder!&mdash;A girl may be very agreeable and "all that," as
people say when they want to cut description short; but it's impossible
she can hold a candle to a young widow. She is obliged to be
circumspect in all she says,&mdash;to weigh every word,&mdash;to cripple her
conversation, lest she should be thought forward; but, worse than
this, she is so deuced simple and credulous, that a man with a fine
flowing tongue is apt to mislead her, and place himself in a false
position before he gets through a set of quadrilles; whereas with the
other partner it is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout au contraire</i>. "Old birds are not to be
caught with chaff;" and old the youngest widow is, in "the ways of
men," compared with the bread-and-butter portion of the unmarried
world. You may rattle on as much as you please, so may she; you
neither of you mean anything, and both of you know it: besides,
no one has a right to forbid it; you are your own master, she her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
own mistress. Dance ten times in an evening with her, and call in
the morning. What then!&mdash;she has her own house, her own servants.
What more?&mdash;she is&mdash;able to take care of herself.</p>

<p>So much for a young widow in society, or those scenes of life in
which the actors and actresses play more immediately against one
another; scenes in which tragedy, comedy, melo-drama, and farce&mdash;the
last predominating&mdash;are brought before us. Now, if we step
behind the scenes, and look a little into the privacy of the domestic
circle, and observe her as one of the "select few," we fancy we shall
still find her maintaining her pre-eminence as an intelligent companion
and delightful friend. When we use the term "intelligent," we
do not presume to say that she is necessarily more acute than she was
as a coy maiden, or than the virgin of our acquaintance, as touching
any branch of historical, artistical, or scientific information; but we
mean intelligent in an unobtrusive but every-day-available knowledge
of "men and things,"&mdash;in other words, a knowledge of the
world. She has pushed off from shore, and has learnt a little of the
current of life, its eddies, shoals, and quicksands. She has lost the
dangerous confidence of inexperience, without having acquired an
uncharitable distrust; and smiles at the greenness of girlhood, without
assuming the infallibility of age. She is not too old to have sympathy
for youth, nor so young as to slight the experience of years.
In her past, joy and sorrow have commingled; in her future, hope is
chastened by reason.</p>

<p>Some imaginative people of bygone centuries decided that fire
produced all things, and that this fire was inclosed in the earth. Of
fire, Vesta was the goddess; or, as the Romans sometimes thought,
Vesta herself was fire. Ovid is our authority for this:</p>

<p class="linequot">"Nec tu aliud Vestam quàm vivam intellige flammam."
</p>

<p>The same gentleman, also, synonymizes her with another element:</p>

<p class="linequot">"&mdash;&mdash; Tellus Vestaque numen idem est."
</p>

<p>Now, whether Vesta was fire, or fire Vesta, or whether the earth
and Vesta were one and the same fire, we are not in a condition to
determine; and as there are no muniments of any Insurance Office to
throw light on the matter,&mdash;even the "Sun" had not then begun
business in this line,&mdash;the curiosity of the curious must remain unquenched.
This, however we know, that Vesta's waiting-women;&mdash;we
beg their pardon, the goddess's lady's-maids,&mdash;the Vestales of her
Temple, had, beyond the usual routine of their business, such as
dressing and undressing her; waiting her whims, and getting up her
linen, the onerous charge of watching and guarding the holy fire, and
lighting it once a year, whether it required lighting or not. The
first of March was the appointed day for this ceremony; though the
first of April might have been, under all the circumstances, a more
appropriate anniversary. We have no distinct records as to whether
these young women were familiar with the application of flint and
steel to tinder, or whether the royal-born Lucifer had, in those days,
taken out a patent for his matches; there is little reason for regret,
however, in this uncertainty, inasmuch as neither the one nor the
other could have been made use of. The holy fire might be supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
from no common flame, and they had therefore to ask "the favour of
a light" from the pure and unpolluted rays of the Sun.</p>

<p>Now we humbly conceive that our motive for introducing this interesting
little classical episode must be obvious from its conclusion.</p>

<p>We were talking of one&mdash;though certainly not in any probability
a Vestal virgin&mdash;whose "sacred flame" had gone out, and we felt
we should be expected to say something of its re-lighting. Thinking,
preparatory to writing, we recollected all that we <em>have</em> written, and
we were interested and amused with the identity of means employed
for a common end two thousand years ago and in the present day;
as it then was, so it now is, managed by <em>attraction</em>.</p>

<p>It has just occurred to our reflective mind, that the imaginative
people before-mentioned must have been figurative also; and meant
by earth, human clay,&mdash;and by the fire therein, love. We should
like to know what love will <em>not</em> do; and, until we are told, we shall
deem it capable, as the ancients did fire, of producing everything.</p>

<p>And now a few words upon the marriage of a young widow. We
might be expected to discuss the question of second marriages generally,
and weigh the arguments pro and con,&mdash;the romance against
the reality of life; but we decline doing so at present, on the ground
that, right or wrong, young widows at any rate have ever had, if
possible, and even will have, a second string to their bow, should
grim Death rudely snap the first,&mdash;a second arrow to their quiver,
should the first be lost "beyond recovery."</p>

<p>She marries again,&mdash;may we say, loves? If she has loved before,
we may not. <em>He</em> is in the grave, and her "heart is in the coffin
there." But she marries; and, though she may exclaim,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"No more&mdash;no more,&mdash;oh! never more on me</div>
<div class="verse">The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>in the spirit of the words,&mdash;she takes nothing from their truth by
substituting one reading for another:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"No more&mdash;no more,&mdash;oh! never more on me</div>
<div class="verse">The <em>greenness</em> of the heart," &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And this, there is no doubt, she does, as she embarks in matrimony
with comfortable confidence a second time.</p>

<p>It is believed that many very sensible men have married young
widows. Without saying whether we believe it, we may observe
that <em>we</em> have never done anything of the kind, and never intend.
This declaration is not inconsistent with perfect sincerity in all we
have said. We have been treating of young widows <em>as</em> widows, not
as wives. Our objections to any transformation on our own account
are many; we shall give only one,&mdash;our extreme diffidence and modesty,
which would never allow us to be judged by comparison as to
the essentials of a good husband. So strong, indeed, is our feeling
on this point, that, notwithstanding our extreme prepossession in their
favour, we verily believe that the most fascinating relict that ever
lived, with the best fortune that was ever funded, might say to us by
her manner, as plainly as a brass-plate on a street-door, "Please to
ring the bell-e," only to suffer defeat and disappointment.</p>

<p>And now we approach the second division, and proceed to pay our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
respects to middle-aged widows; generally, stout, healthy-looking
women with seven children. We have omitted, by-the-bye, to observe,
that young widows cannot have more than two, or at the most
three, without losing caste. Seven children form a very interesting
family, and confer considerable importance on their proprietor, of
whose melancholy bereavement they are perpetual advertisements.
In proportion to the number of pledges presented to a husband, is a
wife's love for him; or, if this be not invariable, at any rate in proportion
to her little ones is her sorrow for his loss; particularly when
he dies leaving nothing behind him but the "regret of a large circle
of friends." For some time, the afflicted woman places great reliance
on an extensive sympathy, and has very little doubt that some one
will some day do something: godfathers and godmothers rise into
importance, and directors of the Blue-coat School are at a premium.
If she be fortunate, her motherly pride is gratified before long by
gazing on her first-born with a trimmed head and yellow cotton
stockings; and by this time she generally finds out she has nothing
more to expect from any one but&mdash;herself.</p>

<p>We have begun with the poor and heavily-burthened middle-aged
widows, because they are by far the most numerous of the class. It
is a singular thing, that we seldom meet with a middle-aged widow
with a small family, or a large provision. The young and the old are
frequently wealthy; not so the other unfortunates. We suppose the
reason of this is, that the harassing cares of an increasing family
kill off a prodigious number of men; and, inasmuch as these cares
would not have existed had Fortune been propitious, they make their
exit in poverty.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, we meet with a middle-aged widow without
children, and with fortune, or a comfortable independence. Of such
a one we shall say a word or two. Generally speaking, she looks
with extreme resignation on the affliction that has overtaken her;
and, when she speaks of it, does so in the most Christian spirit. Of
all widows, she is the most sure that "everything is for the best;"
and, as she has no living duplicates of the lost original, her bosom is
less frequently rent by recollections of the past. Anxious, however,
to prove her appreciation of the holy state, and offer the best testimony
of her sense of one good husband, she rarely omits taking a
second; and, purely to diminish the chance of having twice in her
life to mourn the loss of her heart's idol, she generally selects one
some ten or fifteen years younger than herself. We say "selects,"
because it is very well known, that, though maids are wooed, widows
are not. The first time a woman marries is very frequently to please
another; the second time, invariably herself: she therefore takes the
whole management of the matter into her own hands. We think that
this is quite as it should be: it stands to reason that a woman of
seven or eight and thirty, who has been married, should know a great
deal more about married life than a young gentleman of twenty-five,
who has not. And then he gets a nice motherly woman to take care
of him, and keep him out of mischief, and has the interest of her money
to forward him in his profession or business,&mdash;the principal has been
too carefully settled on the lady to be in any risk.</p>

<p>We do occasionally encounter some "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rara avis in terris</i>"&mdash;a middle-aged
widow who thinks nothing of further matrimony; and so convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
are we of the "dangerous tendency" of such characters, that we
would at once consign them to perpetual imprisonment. If they declared
their resolution in time, we would undoubtedly try it, by burying
them with their first lover, or burning them Hindoo fashion; for,
supposing them to have no children, to what possible good end can
they propose to live? It is our firm belief that they know too much
to be at perfect liberty, with safety to society; and they must of
necessity be so thoroughly idle, beyond knitting purses and reading
novels, as to make mischief the end and aim of their existence. We
ask fearlessly of our readers this question&mdash;"Did you ever in your
lives know an unmarrying, middle-aged, childless widow, who was
not a disagreeable, slanderous, and strife-inducing creature?" If
you ever did, you ought to have tickled her to death,&mdash;so as to have
avoided disfigurement,&mdash;and sent her in a glass-case to the British
Museum.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be said by some, that they have known such a
woman as we have just enquired about, and that they don't think she
merited any such fate; perhaps they will say that she was a very
harmless, pleasant person, and only remained single because she held
her heart sacred to her departed lord. Cross-grained and ugly
middle-aged widows may occasionally foster this romance; as also
may those whose husbands have exemplified by their wills that
jealousy may outlive life, by decreeing that their flower should lose
its sweetness upon another presuming to wear it,&mdash;in other words,
that, upon a second marriage, the worldly advantages of the first
should determine.</p>

<p>There is a class of men in the world, who go through two-thirds of
their life single, and who, if you were to believe them, never entertain
the remotest notion of being "bothered with a wife." In some
instances this arises from an early indulgence in dissipation; and,
from keeping very equivocal company. In their own opinion they are
extremely knowing, and are continually wondering "how men can
make such asses of themselves" as to put their necks into the matrimonial
noose; if you attempt to argue with them on the stupidity,
if not baseness of their creed, they assure you confidently
that "women are all alike." We once made a fellow of this sort
ashamed of himself, when, having ended a long tirade, which was a
coarse amplification of Pope's line,</p>

<p class="linequot">"But every woman is at heart a rake,"
</p>

<p>we asked him, with sufficient emphasis, "Who his mother and sisters
were <em>living</em> with?"</p>

<p>Another portion of the ring-renouncers are men who are so abominably
selfish, that they would not share an atom of their worldly
substance with the most perfect specimen of "the precious porcelain
of human clay" that the world could produce them;&mdash;men who look
with horror on the expenses of an establishment, and live in miserable
hugger-muggery on some first-floor, sponging on their friends to the
extremity of meanness;&mdash;men who look upon children with as much
horror as that with which they would view a fall in the funds or the
stoppage of their banker, and see nothing in them but a draft upon
their pockets.</p>

<p>There is yet another body of solitaries, much smaller in number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
though, than either of the other two;&mdash;men who underrate themselves,
and who are so extremely diffident and bashful as never to
have "popped the question," though their tongues have often had
the itch to do it;&mdash;men who people their room, as they sit over the
fire, with an amiable woman and half-a-dozen little ones, and, when
they rub their eyes into the reality of their nothingness, sigh for the
happiness of some envied friend. It was necessary that we should
make this digression.</p>

<p>We left the middle-aged widow with a large family and small
means, convinced that, having got one child provided for,&mdash;enabling
every one to speak of a kind act as though they had something to do
with it,&mdash;she had then only to rely upon herself. She <em>does</em> rely upon
herself; and, in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand,
her own resources are sufficient to change her state. Men may
make fools of girls, but women make fools of men. In this work of
retribution, middle-aged widows with families pre-eminently take the
lead. They work particularly on those gentlemen whom we have
here introduced; and more particularly and successfully on the first
and third class, though the second are not unfrequently made examples
of. It will be said that the first class are fools to hand: so
they are; and, when caught, they find it out themselves. They are
flies, buzzing about and blowing every fair fame they are not scared
from. The widow spreads her web of flattery and flirtation; and
when the poor insect ventures boldly in, confident that he can at any
moment "take wing and away," she rolls him round and round in her
meshes, as a spider does a blue-bottle,&mdash;or, to use a very expressive
idiom, she "twists him round her finger," ring-shape. The consequential,
slanderous, and boasting booby sinks into the insignificance
of a caged monkey, and lives and dies a miserable Jerry Sneak!
Look into society, and you will find many of them.</p>

<p>We admit it is a hard fate for a man, whose only failing, perhaps,
has been his modesty, to be secured for the purpose of feeding the
hungry and clothing the naked; but then it must be remembered
that, had not a widow proposed to him, he would never have had
courage to propose to anybody, and that he gets a companion for
life and a ready-made family, instead of lingering on in envy and
despair.</p>

<p>Seeing that we have called all widows old, who are on the grave
side of forty, we feel that we have the most difficult portion of our
subject to discuss,&mdash;difficult, and, we may add, delicate, because so
very few of those who are obnoxious to what we may say, will be
inclined to admit it; indeed, if we had any hope of getting over this
difficulty by throwing in ten or fifteen years more, we would do so,
and date only from fifty or fifty-five. We know, however, that this
would not extricate us, and so prefer adhering to our original scale.
Widows of forty and upwards command very little of the sympathy
that waits on those bereaved in earlier life. The reason of this,
perhaps, is, that they are not themselves so interesting. It is astonishing
how much we feel through our eyes. We are told that
"Pity is akin to love," and we might enter into some curious speculations
as to the various deductions to be drawn from these words.
Supposing we see a young creature of one-and-twenty, in all the
freshness of life and first grief, who has buried a lover in a husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
after two or three years of unalloyed happiness; she has an infant,
perhaps, in each arm. Do we pity her? Deeply,&mdash;acutely; we
could almost weep for her. Well; we meet a woman in the autumn
of life, whose summer has been passed with the first and only object
of her affections; hearts that yearned towards each other in youth,
time has made one; in every inclination, wish, hope, fear, they have
heightened the pleasures of life by a mutual enjoyment of them, and
alleviated its sorrows by sharing them together. Death has divorced
them, and we see her&mdash;alone! We are very sorry for her, and her
four or five children; it is "a sad loss:"&mdash;we say so, and of course
we mean it; but are we as sensitive to this picture as to that?</p>

<p>If we make second marriages a principal feature in this dissertation
on widows, we do so because it is their "being's end and aim," as is
incontrovertibly proved by their all but universality. Old widows,
even if poor, sometimes lend an able hand in the retaliation of which
we have before spoken; but, unfortunately, they also very frequently,
when they happen to have wealth, become themselves objects of
scorn and derision. Perhaps the most offensive creature in existence,
and, save one, the most contemptible, is the worn-out, toothless,
hairless, wrinkled jade, who attempts,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"&mdash;&mdash; Unholy mimickry of Nature's work!</div>
<div class="verse">To recreate, with frail and mortal things,</div>
<div class="verse">Her withered face;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and then, upon the strength of a long purse, puts herself up, a decayed
vessel, to Dutch auction, herself proclaiming what she is worth, to be
knocked down&mdash;we are almost unmanly enough to wish it were not
figuratively&mdash;to some needy young spendthrift, of whose grandmother
she must have been a juvenile contemporary. Widows of this
stamp are almost always women raised from low stations, from whom,
perhaps, little delicacy or refinement is to be expected. There is
hardly a season in which some carcase-butcher's or grocer's wealthy
relict is not the talk, and wonder, and emetic of the town.</p>

<p>We must not conclude with exceptions, however, where they
create so unfavourable an impression; we will rather turn to those
portly and obliging widows who, after looking a little about them as
single women, fall in with some comfortable old gentleman who very
much wants a housekeeper, and somebody to mix his grog o' nights,
and at once agree to take the situation. The old boy puts all his
affairs into her hands, and they rub on together cosily enough the
remainder of their days. Every one admits it to be "a very suitable
match;" if an objection be made by anybody, it merely comes from
some expectant nephews or nieces.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> widows we think, we must admit it, who, widows once,
remain so for ever, and from inclination, or rather from disinclination
to encourage any impression, or even thought, that might weaken or
interfere with the memory of the past; but we must repeat that they
are never young, and rarely middle-aged widows: they are women
past the meridian of their days, whose griefs, not violent or obtrusive,
have yet been solemn and absorbing; women who have lost the
vanity of believing they can accommodate themselves to any man;
and, dwelling on the happiness they <em>have</em> enjoyed, cherish its recollection
as an act of devotion to one "not dead, but gone before."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
They wear their "weeds" as long as they are of this world; and there
is always a quietness, if not gravity of demeanour, that perfectly
assorts with them. In society they are always respected; by those
who know them, loved; they do not hesitate to talk of their married
life, and live over many of its scenes, to those who are interested in
listening: herein they differ from married widows, if we may use
the expression, who very rarely talk of their first union to any one
but their husbands; they, perhaps, hear of it something too much,
and too often!</p>

<p>And now, having passed our compliments and paid our respects,
we must take our leave. We have been guilty of one rudeness,&mdash;we
have had all the talk to ourselves: in return, we promise to be patient
listeners, should any fair controversialist think fit to propound her
views on this "highly-interesting and important subject."</p>

<h3>THE FIVE FLOORS.</h3>


<p>The Boulevards may be said to perform for Paris the functions fulfilled
by the cestus of Venus towards that amphibious goddess, by surrounding
it with a magic girdle of fascinations. Every sort and variety
of entertainment is to be found comprised in their cincture of the
city,&mdash;from the stately Académie de Musique and Italian Opera (full
of dandies and dowagers), to the trestles of rope-dancers, amphitheatres
of dancing-dogs, and galleries of wax-work, (full of ploughboys and
pickpockets,)&mdash;and every species of domicile, from the gorgeous hôtel
to the humble stalls of the vendors of liquorice-water and <em>galette</em>.
At one extremity we have the costly <em>menu</em> of the Café de Paris, with
its <em>ortolans</em> and <em>poudings à la Nessebrode</em>; at the other, the greasy
<em>fricots</em> of La Courtille. The Café Turc brays forth with Tolbecque,
and an orchestra of trumpets and bassoons; the <em>guinguettes</em> of the
Faubourg St. Antoine scrape away with their solitary fiddle. Every
species of shop and merchandize, from the sumptuous <em>magazin</em> of Le
Revenant to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boutique à vingt-cinq sous</i>; every species of temple,
from the Parthenonic Madeleine, to that aërial shrine of liberty, the
site of the Bastille. Every gradation of display between splendour
and misery is epitomized in the circuit of the Boulevards.</p>

<p>Play, opera, farce, feats of equestrianism, funambulism, somnambulism,
and humbugism of every colour, industrious fleas, and idle vendors
of magic eye-salve, successively arrest the attention; while in the vicinity
of the Café Tortoni, famous for the coldness of its ices and heat
of its quarrels, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">courtier marron</i> plies his trade of trickery; stock-jobbing
has full possession of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</i>; and almost within hearing
of the knowing ears of the Jockey-Club, and the ears polite of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Club Anglais</i>, bulls and bears outbellow the fashionable jabber of
the Boulevards.</p>

<p>On emerging from the head-quarters of English Paris,&mdash;the Rue de
la Paix,&mdash;to the Boulevards des Capucines and des Italiens, the eye is
dazzled by gilding, gas-light, plate-glass, scagliola, or moulu, varnished
counters, and panelling in grotesque and arabesque, interspersed
with glittering mirrors, as appliances and means of getting off the
lowest goods at the highest rate. A little further, and by an imperceptible
gradation, vice succeeds to frivolity. Instead of milliners
and jewellers, we find billiard-tables and gambling-houses, deepening
at length, into the more tremendous hazards of the Stock Exchange.
After passing the vicinity of the Bourse, we come, naturally enough,
to the quarter of the Jews; passing through the speculative neighbourhood
of Le Passage des Panoramas, which is but a splendid game
of chance materialised into stone and marble.</p>

<p>Next to this gaudy section of the modern Babylon dwells solid
trade,&mdash;the streets of St. Denis and St. Martin,&mdash;accompanied by such
theatres and such coffee-houses as might be expected to minister to
the sensual and intellectual delights of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marchand en gros</i>; melo-drama,
and the Porte St. Martin,&mdash;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cadran Bleu</i>, and its unctuous
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuisine</i>. The vicinage of Rag Fair (the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marché aux vieux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
linges</i>) succeeds; then the Boulevard still bearing the name of Beaumarchais
(the mansion formerly inhabited by the creator of Figaro
being appropriately occupied by a refinery of salt); and lastly, in the
wake of rags and wits, the site of the Bastille,&mdash;the rallying-point of
the most seditious parish of Paris, the republican quarter of the manufacturers,
the tremendous Faubourg St. Antoine.</p>

<p>It was precisely at the boundary limit between the pleasure and
business sections of the Boulevards, at the corner of the Rue du Faubourg
Montmartre, on an airy second-floor with a projecting balcony,
commanding a view of the sporting world to the right, and the trading
world to the left,&mdash;the idle west, and active east,&mdash;that there lived a
certain Monsieur Georges,&mdash;a little wizened man, of doubtful age,
doubtful fortune, doubtful reputation. Everything about him was
equivocal. In Paris people occupy themselves far less than in London
with the affairs of their neighbours: the great have something better
to do, the little something worse; the rich being too busy with
play, the poor too busy with work, to have leisure for the dirty scandals
which spring up like <em>fungi</em> in that region of lords and lackeys,
Grosvenor Square. Nevertheless, the porter's lodge of every Parisian
house is a chartered temple of echo, having a gossipry and a
jargon of its own. The porter's lodge knits stockings, reads novels,
and composes romances; peeps into letters, interrogates chambermaids,
and confederates with duns. A man loose in his habits had
need be very close in his domestics, in order to escape the detection
of his porter's lodge.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of fifteen years' domiciliation in that polished corner
of the Boulevards, Monsieur Georges, though far from a beauty,
was still a mystery. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame la portière</i> had never been able to discover
whether "Georges" was a surname given by father to son,
or a Christian name given by godfather to godson. She sometimes
thought him a single man, sometimes a double, nay, sometimes a
treble. Curious varieties of the fair sex occasionally visited the balconied
saloon,&mdash;young, old, and middle-aged,&mdash;shabby-genteels who
passed for poor relations, and glaring tawdry who passed for worse.
There was no roost in his abode, however, either for the birds with
fine feathers, or the birds without. Monsieur Georges's foible was
not that of hospitality. His interests were too intimately cared for
by a ferocious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de confiance</i>, who set himself and his house in
order, and caused his establishment to be designated in the neighbourhood
as that of Georges and the Dragon.</p>

<p>If not generous, however, the little man was strictly just; he gave
nothing, but he kept nothing back. He paid his way with the praiseworthy
punctuality remarkable in those who never pay an inch of the
way for other people.</p>

<p>It is a hard thing, by-the-bye, that while male designations leave
the facts of the man's bachelorhood uncertain, a spinster is specially
pointed out by the malice of conventional phraseology. Mr. or Monsieur
may be married or single, as he pleases; but Mrs. and Madame
assume, even on the direction of a letter, their airs of matronly superiority
over Miss or Mademoiselle. While her master rejoiced in
his ambiguity as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</i> Georges, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle</i> Berthe was designated
to mankind and womankind in all the odium of spinsterhood;
and exclamations of "old maid" and "<em>chissie</em>" followed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
daily passage past the porter's lodge, the moment the "grim white
woman" reached the first floor.</p>

<p>Among those who indulged in the acrimonious apostrophe, the
most persevering, if not the loudest, was an urchin of some fourteen
years old, whom Monsieur Georges had added to his establishment
two years before, by way of Jack Nasty, foot-page, or errand-boy,
under an engagement to clean Monsieur Georges and the housekeeper's
shoes, without dirtying the ante-room with his own; to work
much, eat little, sleep less; to keep his ears open, and his mouth
shut; his hands full, and his stomach empty; his legs were to be
evermore running, his tongue never. Now, little Auguste, (Auguste
in the parlour, and Guguste in the porter's lodge,) though reared in a
provincial foundling hospital, where infants are fed, like sheep, on a
common, by the score, and washed, like pocket-handkerchiefs, by the
dozen, had unluckily both a will and an appetite of his own. Cleaning
Mademoiselle Berthe's shoes inspired him with a fancy for standing
in them; and, on more than one occasion, he was found to have
encroached upon the housekeeper's breakfast of coffee and cream, instead
of contenting himself with wholesome filtred water. He was
forthwith accused of being a greedy pig, as well as of making a litter
in the apartments; till, after six months of faultiness and fault-finding,
Monsieur Georges pronounced him to be an incorrigible <em>gamin</em>,
sentenced him to "bring firing at requiring," and blacken shoes as
usual, but to have his bed in an attic under the roof, (Parisianly called,
after the famous Parisian architect, a <em>mansarde</em>,) and his board
in the porter's lodge, where the board was exceedingly hard; Madame
Grégoire,&mdash;the knitter of stockings, reader of novels, and coiner
of romances for the corner-house of the Rue Montmartre,&mdash;having
consented to feed and cherish him at the rate of twenty-five francs
per month, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">id est</i>, five weekly shillings lawful coin of her Majesty's
realm. Monsieur Georges perhaps intended to starve the saucy
gamin into submission; he <em>did</em> almost succeed in starving him into
an atrophy.</p>

<p>Guguste, however, was a lad of spirit, and could hunger cheerfully
under the housekeeping of the kind-hearted Madame Grégoire,
who made up for the scantiness of her cheer by the abundance of
her cheerfulness, buttered her parsnips with fine words, and gave
the poor half-clothed <em>gamin</em> the place nearest the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chauffrette</i>, (fire she
had none,) while Mademoiselle Berthe made the apartment on the
second floor too hot to hold him. Madame Grégoire,&mdash;whose only
daughter was the wife of a puppet-showman, and whose only grandson,
a seller of sparrows <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouged et noired</i> into bullfinches, or white-washed
into canaries, on the Pont Neuf,&mdash;transferred a considerable
portion of her unclaimed dividends of maternal tenderness to the
little orphan. Her son was a soldier, serving (as she said) at Algiers
in the Indies, and by no means likely to enter into rivalship
with the slave of Monsieur Georges and Mademoiselle Berthe's
household.</p>

<p>"'Tis a strange thing, my dear child," mumbled the old woman
to Guguste, as they sat down together one day to their six o'clock
soup, (a composition of hot water, cabbage-stalks, half an ounce of
bacon, and a peck of salt,) "that so long as I have held the string<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
in this house, not a drop of wine, either in piece or bottle, has ever
gone through the gateway to the address of Monsieur Georges!
Every month comes the supply of chocolate from Marquise's for
Monsieur, and from the Golden Bee a cargo of Bourbon coffee and
beetroot sugar for the housekeeper; but of wine not a pint."</p>

<p>"Neither Georges nor the Dragon are honest souls enough to
trust themselves with their cups," said the knowing <em>gamin</em>. "Wine
tells truth, they say. None but an ass talks now-a-days of truth
lying at the bottom of a well;&mdash;'tis in the bottom of a hogshead of
claret. Ma'mselle Berthe, who can do nothing but lie, is the liar in
the well. <em>She</em> can't keep her head above water."</p>

<p>"But Monsieur Georges, who need entertain no fear of making
too free with his own secrets after a glass or two, inasmuch as no
living mortal ever dips with him in the dish;&mdash;surely Monsieur
might indulge on Sundays, and fête days, and the like?"</p>

<p>"And so he does indulge, Maman Grégoire,&mdash;so he does! Some
folks like their champagne, some their burgundy. Master loves
to take an internal hot-bath after the English fashion."</p>

<p>"A tea-drinker? <em>sacristie!</em> what effeminacy!" exclaimed the old
woman, bravely swallowing, out of a spoon of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métal d'Alger</i>, a large
mouthful of tepid cabbage water. "I recollect seeing tea made
upon the stage, in the farce of 'Madame Pochet et Madame Gibou.'
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jésu!</i> what nastiness! I really wonder at Monsieur Georges! So
spruce and so cleanly a gentleman as he looks, when, every evening
just as St. Philip's church chimes the half-hour after seven, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
cordon, s'il vous plait</i>,' gives me notice of his exit! His superfine
blue coat and garnet-coloured velvet waistcoat without a speck of
dust upon them!"</p>

<p>"Thanks to <em>me</em>!" interposed Guguste.</p>

<p>"His <em>toupet</em> shining with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">huile antique</i>."</p>

<p>"Thanks to <em>me</em>!" continued Guguste.</p>

<p>"His boots varnished like looking-glasses."</p>

<p>"Thanks to <em>me</em>!" pursued Guguste.</p>

<p>"His hat smoothed as with an iron."</p>

<p>"Thanks to <em>me</em>,&mdash;thanks to <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>"His <em>jabot</em> plaited as if by machinery, and white as snow; while
his great diamond studs look out like eyes of fire from the frilling,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank to&mdash;no, not thanks to <em>me</em>!" cried Guguste. "I must
own that Ma'mselle Berthe, who is so much in the starch line, still
presides in the washing and ironing department; and, as to the
brilliants, which you say shine in the dark like cats' eyes, master
keeps them like the apple of his own."</p>

<p>"I wonder what makes him so wonderful particular about his dress
after nightfall?" said Madame Grégoire, peering through her spectacles
into the face which she was preparing to cross-examine.
"Humph?"</p>

<p>"Can't say," replied Guguste, tilting the soup-tureen to transfer
the last drop of warm salt-water to his own plate.</p>

<p>"You mean <em>won't</em>; you <em>could</em> fast enough if you would, child!"
said Madame Grégoire pettishly.</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried the <em>gamin</em>, (who was perhaps of opinion that the
kicks, which, more than half-pence, constituted his salary in Monsieur
Georges's service, formed a tie upon his discretions,)&mdash;"how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
can <em>you</em>, Ma'me Grégoire, who are such a very sensible woman,
imagine it possible, that while I am clearing away the dinner things
down stairs in the porter's lodge, or up stairs in Ma'mselle Berthe's
chamber, I can have an eye to master's proceedings after he has
crossed his threshold! Maybe he goes to the opera."</p>

<p>"Three nights in the week. But the other four?"</p>

<p>"There are fifteen theatres open, as I've heard tell, in the city
and the suburbs," quoth Guguste drily.</p>

<p>"But, gentlemen as <em>is</em> gentlemen (which is what Monsieur Georges
calls himself, however he may be called by others,) don't put on
diamond studs and embroidered waistcoats, to go to the playhouses!"</p>

<p>"Don't they? How should I know?" demanded Guguste, polishing
the pewter spoon on his sleeve as he was accustomed to do
those of his master's double-threaded silver. "What do I see of
playhouses?"</p>

<p>"Why, you ungrateful child! didn't I give you a ticket for the pit
of the Porte St. Martin, for that moving piece, 'The Spectre Abbot,'
on the night of Ma'mselle Isoline's benefit, the deputy-double of the
general-utility <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune prémière</i>, who lodges up stairs in the back attic,
next but one to your own?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I saw 'The Spectre Abbot,' and Ma'mselle Isoline into
the bargain, with three-quarters of a yard of red calico hanging to
her waist, to represent the 'Bleeding Nun;' but I didn't take any
notice whether the gentleman whose elbows were jammed into my
sides wore diamond studs or velvet waistcoats."</p>

<p>"At all events you must perceive that the highly-respectable
gentleman who occupies our splendid first-floor apartment, (Monsieur
Boncoeur, the deputy,) goes out every evening in his carriage
in a very different costume?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Boncoeur, in his carriage, need not hoist a flag of
gentility. Monsieur Georges, on foot, might be hustled off the pavement
but for his brilliants."</p>

<p>"More likely <em>for</em> them," said the porteress.</p>

<p>"Besides, Monsieur Boncoeur is, as you say, such a very respectable-looking
gentleman! His dark, square-cut coat, and pepper-and-salts;
his broad-brimmed hat, and sad-coloured gloves; his
whole outward man seems to have been taken measure of as the picture
of respectability! And see what that very respectability has
brought him to! Partner in one of the first houses in the Rue Bergère;
deputy in the chamber; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marguillier</i> of the parish; a ribbon in his
button-hole; and the picture of himself and his ribbon face to face
with the portrait of Louis Philippe, at the gallery of the Exposition,
for all the world as if they'd a little word to say to each other in
public. Lord bless you! Monsieur Boncoeur's respectable grey
whiskers, respectable speckled stockings, respectable great-coat and
umbrella, are worth a couple of hundred thousand francs a year to
the banking-house in the Rue Bergère, as vouchers for the square-toeishness
of the firm!"</p>

<p>"Lord love thee, child! at thy years how shouldst thou know so
much of the world!" cried Madame Grégoire, removing her spectacles
after this tirade, as if all further perspicacity were superfluous.</p>

<p>"By being thrown upon it from the moment I had years to count,"
cried the urchin. "A foundling hospital, Ma'me Grég. is a famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
whetstone, against which no one can rub without sharpening his
wits!"</p>

<p>"But, since thine are so sharp, boy, how comes it thou hast never
discovered whither Monsieur Georges directs his steps every evening,
winter and summer, at half-past seven."</p>

<p>"Because 'tis my business to know, and I prefer my pleasure.
I've some sort of <em>right</em>, you see, to interest myself in master's proceedings;
but in those of Monsieur Boncoeur of the first floor,
Ma'mselle Isoline of the attic, Madame la Baronne de Gimbecque, the
pretty lady with the handsome <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cachemires</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé</i>, and black eyes, who
lodges in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrésol</i>, and Madame Courson, the widow lady, on the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">troisième</i>, I've nothing but wrong; and, accordingly, not a step do
they take with which I am not conversant. I could tell you, if you
wanted to know, where Madame Courson's poor, little, pale, patient
daughter, Demoiselle Claire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank ye,&mdash;thank ye! I fancy I know more of my lodgers than
<em>you</em> do! All I ask you, is, concerning your master. Monsieur
Georges is the only inmate of this house for whom it has ever been
my fortune to pull the string without discovering, before the end of
the first term, the source of his income, where he came from, whither
he was going, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good evening, grandmamma!" squeaked a voice at the moveable
pane of the glass-door,&mdash;the arrow-slit, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">meurtrière</i>, through which
every porteress is privileged to parley with visitors at meal-times or
in windy weather.</p>

<p>"'Tis Dodo!" exclaimed Guguste, rising to open the latch for the
lean and impish-looking grandson of Madame Grégoire, whose wistful
glances in eyeing the empty tureen plainly indicated that his
visit had been miscalculated by a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>"Mother desired me to call and inquire after the rheumatic pain
in your right shoulder," continued Dodo, (the short for Dodore,&mdash;which
is short for Theodore, in cockney Parisian.)</p>

<p>"'Twas in my left, and it has left me," said the old woman
peevishly; "and don't sit on that chair, child. The knitting-needles
in the stocking may do you a mischief. How's your mother?"</p>

<p>"Mamma's got a cold, sitting out in the showers yesterday afternoon,
to finish shaving a poodle which a customer was werry particular
to get done in time to go out to dinner."</p>

<p>"Humph! I fancied, Dodo, <em>you</em> had taken that part of the business
off her hands. I thought she made over the scissors to you at
Michaelmas last?"</p>

<p>"And so she did for anything of plain work," replied the brat;
"but this was a choice customer, and a bit of fancy work; a great
big grey <em>barbet</em>, which stands as high as a rocking-horse, whose
master is curious in his shaving. The gentleman's a poet, what
does the off-rights <em>romantique</em> for Victor Hugo's plaything playhouse
at the Porte St. Antoine; and, as the vulgars is apt to have their
poodles lion-fashion, Monsieur Eugène gives hisn a mane and forelock;
which, with cropped ears, looks for all the world like a unicorn!"</p>

<p>"What an ass!" cried Madame Grégoire contemptuously, tapping
her snuff-box. "These poet and player folk makes themselves notorious,
and fancies themselves famous!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how goes on your own business, Dodo?" demanded Guguste,
assuming in the presence of the starveling of nine years old
the airs of a man of the world.</p>

<p>"Pretty smart, thank ye. I've just set up two new sparrow-traps
in a ditch under the barrack-wall at Montrouge; and last week I
sold a pair of as fine canaries as a coating of plaster of Paris and
gamboge could make 'em, to a fine English lady in a carriage, as was
crossing the bridge to the flower-market. Gave the brace of birds
for nine francs, one of which I slipped into the hand of her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laquais de
place</i>. But then I was out of business, you see, for three days
a'twards, for fear of the police."</p>

<p>"Dodo, you'll be disgracing your family one of these days by
being took up!" said Madame Grégoire impressively. "I remember
my respectable first-floor, Monsieur Boncoeur, bringing home a
piping bullfinch last year he'd bought on the Boulevards, whose
red breast washed off the first showery day, all as one as Ma'mselle
Isoline's rouge after a flood of tears in a melodrame! The poor dear
gentleman had half a mind to have up the seller of the impositious bird
before the commissary of the district; only, as he'd paid for it with
an old coat unbeknownst to his valet, and an old coat not being lawful
coin of the realm, there was a doubt in his mind about his power
of bringing the vagabond to justice."</p>

<p>"Which? Himself, or the impositious bird, or the industrious
fowler as was arning a living for his family?" inquired Guguste.</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried Madame Grégoire, laying her hand on the cord
as Monsieur Georges' thin voice was heard giving utterance to his
usual evening cry of "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le cordon!</i>" Guguste slunk behind her
high-backed chair as his tyrant passed the window,&mdash;his withered,
sallow face enlivened by his gold-mounted spectacles, and his mean
person coquetted into consequence, perforce of velvet and trinkets.
Burnished from top to toe, he was the very moral of one of Giroux's
toys, the very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">im</i>moral of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevalier d'industrie</i>.</p>

<p>Certain that his master's exit would be the signal for his being
fetched out of that, by the shrill summons of Ma'mselle Berthe to
set the place in order, and make up the fire, (against the arrival of
her cousin, Madame Dosne, an ex-box-opener of the Ambigu Comique,
who occupied a chamber in the story above, and was admitted
to the honour of seeing her prim relative play patience, and of sipping
a glass of sugar and water with her on a long winter's evening,)
Guguste flitted upward to the discharge of his duties, leaving
the skinny imp of the Pont Neuf and his grandam to commune of
domestic matters. While waiting the summons of Monsieur Boncoeur's
demure-looking footman to open the gate for the demure-looking
chariot of that highly demure and respectable individual,
Madame Grégoire accordingly interrogated the boy concerning his
father's absence from the sweets of his domestic hearth.</p>

<p>"Papa is making a tour in the south," replied the imp. "He
passed the summer in the Pyrenees. The Pyrenees are quite in
fashion in papa's line of business!"</p>

<p>"Ay, 'tis well for him that Gothon likes him to lead such a rambling
life!" said Madame Grégoire in a moralizing tone. "When
my poor daughter thought proper to marry a showman, I told her how
it would be! To think, now, of a child of mine, a respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portière</i> in the same house, of the same parish, for forty years'
standing."</p>

<p>"The house?"</p>

<p>"The <em>house</em>, ignoramus!&mdash;The house is a century old, built by
the Regent Duke of Orleans, father of his unfortunate majesty,
Louis XIV, as you might read in history,&mdash;if you knew how to
read.&mdash;To think of a child of mine, I say, squatting on a wooden
stool, like a wild Indian, winter and summer, with nothing but a
cold river under her feet, and cold oil-cloth over her head, on the
look-out for a poodle in want of clipping, or some mouse-eaten-out-of-house-and-home
baker in want of a tabby kitten! I protest I never
think of my poor Gothon and her stock-in-trade,&mdash;her cage of cats
on one side, and her string of puppies on the other,&mdash;without bitter
anguish of soul. Why can't your father stay at home, Dodore, and
set up in the Champs Elysées, or at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barrières</i>, like other respectable
men of his profession, to be nearer home?"</p>

<p>"Bless your heart!" remonstrated Dodo, "papa took up his station
three years ago, on the way along the Allée d'Antin, to the
Suspension Bridge. But it all but made a bankrupt of him! There
was too much competition. Pierre the Savoyard, who had his show-box
within fifty yards, has such a winning way with him that not a
nurse-maid, or English lord coming out of Lepage's shooting-gallery,
but used to throw silver to Pierre, where papa took only the brownest
of copper. At last, a nasty, good-for-nothing, designing Jesuit of a
fellow set up in opposition to both on 'em; Scripture pieces, with
Jepfa's daughters, and Dalily and Goliar, a hand-organ, and Dutch
pug as held an old hat, and what not. Papa bore it as long as he
was able; but what was the good of opposition atween friends?
He'd nothing in his box but worn-out things, as old as Methusalem
or Jerusalem, or whatever it is, such as the battle of Marengo, and
the Pyramids, and the landing of Xerxes in the Hellyspunt and a
pack of low-lived fancies. So mamma persuaded him to try the
provinces (where, as all the world knows, the stalest bread goes
down); and so, from fair to fair, he's been touring it this twelvemonth."</p>

<p>"Poor Gothon!"</p>

<p>"Mamma doesn't fret. She says I shall soon be old enough to
take papa's business off his shoulders, and then he'll be able to retire
comfortable; and she'll give up her stall on the Pont Neuf, and
the kitten and canary line, to sister Mary."</p>

<p>Madame Grégoire was about to remonstrate against this perpetuation
of open-air commerce in her posterity, when Monsieur Boncoeur's
signal was given; and, lo, the well-varnished, well-stuffed, but
plain chariot of the thriving banker, rolled after his fat and bean-fed
horses out of the court-yard.</p>

<p>Some minutes afterwards, his portly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de ménage</i>, Madame
Alexandre, stepped into the lodge for a few minutes' gossip with the
porteress previous to proceeding to her evening's <em>Boston</em> with the grocer's
lady at the opposite corner. The comely housekeeper, in her
silk-cloak and bonnet, was naturally an object of dislike and envy to
the withered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portière</i>, in her ragged merino gown and dingy calico
cap. But Christmas was approaching. Her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étrennes</i> for New Year's
Day (to the sum total of which, the first-floor contributed three-fourths)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
were seldom absent from Madame Grégoire's calculations.
Besides, Monsieur Boncoeur's housekeeper was to be conciliated as a
connecting link in her chain of domestic investigation; for Madame
Alexandre not only afforded her quota of information concerning her
own and her master's affairs, but, in pure pryingness of spirit, contrived
to see through stone-walls, and hear down chimneys, while
striving to put this and that together concerning those of her fellow-lodgers.</p>

<p>"Well, Madame Grégoire, what is the best news with us this
evening?" demanded the jolly dame, as soon as the porteress had
despatched her hungry grandson home to his mamma, the kittens and
canaries. "I'm just stepping out, you see, for my little game with
the Pruins. Poor people, they can't do without me! If I warn't
with them before the clock struck eight, I should be having them here
after me; and, to be filling the house with visitors during master's
absence, is a thing I'm not in the habit of doing, as nobody knows,
better than yourself. Indeed, it's a matter of conscience that takes
me out the moment his back is turned. As a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de confiance</i>, I'm
bound to see there's no waste; and where there's visitors there
<em>must</em> be tippling and stuffing; so, out of regard to Monsieur Boncoeur's
property, I'm seldom in the house ten minutes after him. I
hope I know my duty by so respectable a master better than to make
away with his goods like Ma'mselle Berthe up yonder, who keeps open
house like a lady, with as many rings at her bells of an evening as
e'er a duchess in the land! But, as I was saying, Madame Grégoire,&mdash;(Dearie
me, I thought I wasn't by no means comfortable! I've been
sitting on the knitting-needles! lucky my cloak was wadded!)&mdash;as I
was saying, have you made out anything further about them Coursons?"</p>

<p>"Scarce a syllable more than the first day they took possession!
One knowed they was respectable, 'cause our proprietor is exceeding
particular about references,&mdash;(there isn't a partic'larer landlord
from one end of the Boulevards to t'other!)&mdash;and one knowed they
was <em>poor</em>, 'cause their moveables came on a porter's truck, instead
of occupying a cart and horse, as becomes a creditable lodger, or instead
of occupying three vans of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">administration des déménagemens</i>,
as was the case, I remember, when our respectable first-floor moved
in."</p>

<p>Madame Alexandre smiled a neat and appropriate smile of acknowledgment
for her master; while the porteress took breath, a
pinch of snuff, and proceeded.</p>

<p>"But as to their origin, and sitch, I know no more than Adam!
Not an acquaintance in the parish! I even put the water-carrier
upon asking about the neighbourhood; but no such name as Courson
was ever heard of! How do we know, pray, who we've got
among us? Courson may be a sham name, such as we reads of
in Monsieur Jules Janin's novels!"</p>

<p>"Such rubbish, indeed!" said Madame Alexandre, with a sneer,
intended, like the epithet, to apply to the lodgers on the third-floor,
ignored by the water-carrier and public-houses in the neighbourhood,
<em>not</em> to Monsieur Janin's novels, which were probably familiar to them
all.</p>

<p>"Would you believe it, ma'am? there's the saucy minx of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
daughter (Ma'mselle Claire, I think, you told me was her name,) has
the owdacity to bid me good morning or good evening if I haps to
meet her on the stairs, affable-like, as if she felt me her inferiorer!
Me! Now I don't know, Ma'me Grégoire, what your opinion may
be, but <em>I</em> holds (and so does my friends, the Pruins,) that the upper
domestics of the first-floor is on a 'quality with the lodgers of the
third, that keeps no domestics at all."</p>

<p>"Certainly, ma'am, certainly," replied the porteress, still harping
on the amount of her New Year's gift. "But have you made out
nothing of these people's occupations? You're two floors nigher to
'em than me. If I was in <em>your</em> place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you was in that of the housekeeper of Monsieur Georges, you
mean! Ma'mselle Berthe's store-closet looks clean into Ma'mselle
Claire's room."</p>

<p>"Looks dirty in," emended the prying porteress.</p>

<p>"And, if Ma'mselle Berthe wasn't as dry as a handful of deal
shavings, maybe I might have demeaned myself to ask her in a
friendly way how the young lady passed her mornings. But Ma'mselle
Berthe (the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chissie</i>!) condescends to hold just about as much
communication with me as one of the chayney mandarins on the top
of master's cabinet,&mdash;shakes her head by way of salutation, and not a
word!"</p>

<p>"But, Guguste (Monsieur Georges's little lad of all work and no
play) assured me he saw Ma'mselle Courson ring at Monsieur Boncoeur's
bell the other day, and deliver a letter to the footman."</p>

<p>"Oho! that dirty little <em>gamin</em> plays the spy upon those who rings
at Monsieur Boncoeur's bell, do he?" cried the housekeeper, reddening.
"Very dirty behaviour, I must confess!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear madam, my dear friend," whined the porteress in
a tone of deprecation, "did not you yourself inform me that Monsieur
Boncoeur's footman carried up on Sunday se'nnight, by Monsieur
Boncoeur's desire, to Ma'mselle Claire, a box of apricot marmalade,
and the last number of the '<em>Follet</em>'?"</p>

<p>"I said no such thing, ma'am, as I remember. The marmalade
and the journal was both lawfully directed to Madame Courson. I
never so much as insinnivated a word of an intention of attention to
Mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>"Then I miscomprehended, ma'am; in which I'm the more to blame,
because, from the highly-respectable character of the mansion for
which I have the honour to pull the string, (there isn't, as I said before,
a more partic'larer landlord than the proprietor from one end
of the Boulevarts to t'other,) I might have known that even the
letters of a gentleman so distinguished as my first-floor would never
have been received by Ma'mselle, the daughter of Madame Courson."</p>

<p>"<em>That</em>'s all you know about it,&mdash;is it?" cried the lusty housekeeper,
crimsoning with pique. "Then be so good as to tell me
what makes such a young lady as Ma'mselle, Madame Courson's
daughter, write written letters to so distinguished a gentleman as
your first-floor? Answer me that!"</p>

<p>"She couldn't be guilty of anything so heinous!" cried the porteress,
aghast.</p>

<p>"I tell you she <em>was</em>!"</p>

<p>"You <em>must</em> be mistaken!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>"Seeing is believing, Madame Grégoire!"</p>

<p>"Ay! you may have seen her <em>deliver</em> a written letter, poor dear,
from her mamma, in all probability?"</p>

<p>"No such thing!&mdash;from herself."</p>

<p>"Now, how can you possibly know! Did you see her write it?
Do you even know her handwriting?"</p>

<p>"I know her signature,&mdash;'Claire de Courson;' and you told me
your werry self, that the agreement for the lodgings was signed by
her mother as 'Emilie de Courson.'"</p>

<p>"But the signature was inside the written letter. How could
you see <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>"No matter; I did see it with my two eyes as plain as I see
you."</p>

<p>"And that's plain enough," muttered Guguste, who, having crept
back unobserved into the room, was skulking in a corner.</p>

<p>"Why, sure you didn't go to peep?" said the porteress, with a
knowing look of inquiry and accusation.</p>

<p>"What a one you are!" cried Madame Alexandre, trying to turn
off jocularly her self-betrayal. "But, not to haggle with partic'lars
of how the letter came into my hands, into my hands it came; and
what should it be, but a private confidential <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> epistle from
the young lady, saying how Monsieur Boncoeur's reputation for
benevolence was up in the neighbourhood, and how he seemed
inclined to befriend her poor mother, (the apricot marmalade, you
know!) and how it would be a great charity (no, not charity,&mdash;act
of humanity the shabby-genteels calls it,) if he would exert his interest
to procure for her mamma a privilege to sell stamps, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bureau
de papier timbré</i>; for which, of course, his petitioner was ever bound
to pray, and so forth."</p>

<p>"I hope they don't think of setting up anything in the shop or
office line in a house like ourn?" cried Madame Grégoire, with dignity.
"They'll find theirself plaguily out of their reckoning!&mdash;for
I must say it, who shouldn't say it, that there isn't a more partic'larer
landlord."</p>

<p>"I'll just tell you what," ruthlessly interrupted Madame Alexandre,
twitching her silk cloak, as if meditating departure. "Tonight's
Monday, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I <em>do</em> know."</p>

<p>"And that's the reception-night, you know, of the Minister of
the Home Department."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't know."</p>

<p>"And, as sure as life,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord lovee, Ma'me Alexandre, don't use that profane expression!
There's nothing less sure than life!" cried Madame G.
while Auguste groaned in the background.</p>

<p>"As sure as a gun, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Auguste groaned.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Master's gone this evening to the hotel of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ministre de l'Interieur</i>,
to present Ma'mselle Claire's petition for a stamp-office."</p>

<p>"Do you really think things of that sort are done in that sort
of straight-for'ard way?" demanded the porteress. "<em>I</em> fancied that,
when you wanted anything of government, you got a word said for
you to the cousin of some clerk-of-a-deputy-to-an-under-commissioner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
with, maybe, a genteel little offering, to make it go down,&mdash;such
as a Savoy cake, or a China rose-tree in a flower-pot."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You're thinking of folks of your own species," said
the housekeeper disdainfully.</p>

<p>"You forget that my master, Monsieur Boncoeur,'s a representative
of the nation, a governor of the Bank of France, and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marguillier</i>
of the parish. Master's a right to go straight an end to the
king, and tell his majesty any little wish he may have ungratified.
And, if he <em>should</em> think proper to mention to Louis Philippe Ma'mselle
Claire's desire that her mamma should set up a bureau for
stamps, her business is done!"</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the starting up of Guguste, who was
crouching behind them, and placed an admonitory finger on his lip to
impose silence upon Madame Grégoire's meditated rejoinder, just as
a very white hand, holding a very black key, was intruded into the
room through the porter's window; and the silvery accents of Mademoiselle
Courson were heard, announcing to the porteress that she
was going out for half an hour; and that, though her mother remained
at home, she was indisposed, and could receive no visitors."</p>

<p>"<em>Visitors</em>, indeed! Who ever comes to visit <em>them</em>, I should like to
know!" muttered Madame Grégoire, after pulling the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon</i> to admit
of the young lady's egress.</p>

<p>"She certainly <em>had</em> a bundle under her arm!" cried Madame
Alexandre, who had been watching the young lady through the window.
"Now, how I <em>should</em> like to know where she's going."</p>

<p>"To the pharmacy, for medicine for her mother, or to the herborist
for lime-blossoms, to make <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tisanne</i>," said Guguste, who shrewdly
anticipated a request on the part of the elderly ladies that he would
arise and play the spy upon the movements of Mademoiselle Claire.</p>

<p>"Pho! pho! The old lady's only trouble-sick, which would be a
deal worse than body-sick, only that it don't require no physic," observed
the porteress.</p>

<p>"Then she's gone to the laundress."</p>

<p>"Laundress, indeed!" cried the fat housekeeper; "as if low-lived
people like the third-floor wasn't their own laundress!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my dear Ma'me Alexandre," cried the porteress.
"You know we don't allow no hanging out in <em>this</em> house. There's
not a more partic'larer landlord in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis my true and honest belief," interrupted the lady in the silk-cloak,
"that the girl is gone to the Mont de Piété! I said to Robert,
our footman, when he was taking up master's apricot marmalade,
that 'twould be a deal more to the purpose if he took up a
good dish of cutlets, or a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fricandeau</i>; for, as you and I was agreeing
t'other day, my dear Ma'me Grégoire, not an ounce of anything eatable
beyond daily bread ever goes up these blessed stairs to the third-floor.
And, what's more, I've noticed strange changes in Miss and
Madam since they took up in the house; I don't mean in point of
growing thin and meagre, 'cause care alone, without starving, will
bring the poor body of a poor soul down to nothing. But, the day as
their goods came in, Ma'mselle Courson had as good a cloak over
her shoulders as the one on mine (which cost me a good hundred and
thirty livres in the Passage de l'Orme,) and Ma'mselle Claire's having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
a velvet collar doubtless might be counted at twenty more.
What's become of it, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Ay, what's become of it, eh?" added the porteress, tapping her
box.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Certes!</i> people that <em>has</em> a comfortable cloak is apt to put it on
such nights as this!" rejoined the housekeeper; "but I say nothing."</p>

<p>"The young lady may have lent it to her mamma, who is indisposed,"
pleaded Guguste. "Fuel is ris' within the week. I don't
suppose they've too much fire."</p>

<p>"Lent it to her mamma, indeed!" cried Madame Alexandre.
"Why, Madame Courson has as handsome a Thibet shawl as ever
came out of Ternaux's factory."</p>

<p>"<em>Had</em>," emended the porteress. "I haven't seen the red shawl
on her shoulders these three weeks. On that point I has my suspicions."</p>

<p>A single rap, Parisian-wise, at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte cochère</i>, produced the
usual professional tug at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon</i>. The gate flew open; and,
peeping in at the window-pane, was seen the rubicund face of Monsieur
Paul Emile Pruin, the grocer, come in search of his loitering
guest.</p>

<p>"So, so, so!" cried he, on detecting her in the thick of gossip
with the grandmamma of Dodore. "<em>This</em> is the way you keep your
appointments, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma belle voisine</i>? Haven't we had the hearth made up
these three quarters of an hour, candles snuffed, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bougies de l'étoile</i>, always
a-snuffing!) a fresh bottle of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">groseille frambroisée</i> ready to be
uncorked, and a batch of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">biscuits de Rheims</i> ready to be opened?&mdash;Saw
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Député's</i> carriage bowl out, and been hoping ever
since to see you bowl in. Poor Madame Paul in the fidgets, as if
she'd swallowed a flight of swallows,&mdash;up and down,&mdash;in and out.
Sent me over with the umbrella to look after you."</p>

<p>"Thank you,&mdash;thank you!" cried Madame Alexandre. "'Tis the
first of the month, you see," she continued, winking at the blind old
porteress (to whom a nod and wink were much alike) to back her
apologies. "I'd my little postage account to settle with my good
friend here. But now I'm at your service. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allons!</i>"</p>

<p>"Guguste, my dear, show the lantern to Madame Alexandre
over the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruisseau</i>," said the porteress, turning round to look for her
boarder. But Guguste had disappeared. He had perhaps sneaked
away to track the mysterious footsteps of Mademoiselle de Courson.</p>

<h3>REFORM OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.</h3>

<p class="center f90">FROM OUR OWN REPORTER.</p>


<p>Yesterday, a numerous and highly respectable meeting of gentlemen
and ladies interested in the stability of the solar system was
held, pursuant to advertisement in the Vox Stellarum, True Sun, &amp;c.
at the sign of the Great Bear in the North Hemisphere, at One <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
(sidereal time).</p>

<p>Long before the hour named, the neighbouring constellations were
crowded with a brilliant assemblage of all the beauty and fashion of
the upper regions. Amongst the glittering throng we noticed nearly
all the stars of any magnitude occupying their accustomed places, together
with deputations from various influential bodies interested in
the support of the system; the principal Nebulæ, several Signs of
the Zodiac, a deputation from the Electro-magnetic Grand Junction
Company, and from the Galvanic Branch Association, his Highness
the Meridian with several degrees of Longitude, the Equator with
the Latitudinarian party, the Torrid Zone and his Tropics, their High
Mightinesses the Hurricanes, Mr. Monsoon and the Trades' Union of
the South Hemisphere, the Æthereal and Atmospheric Alliance Company,
and, though last not least, their Royal Highnesses the Planets,
who came in state, attended by a guard of honour of their Satellites
in rings and belts, under a royal salute of Thunder and Lightning.</p>

<p>The great Area of the Constellation was brilliantly lit with Zodiacal
light. Notwithstanding the exertions of a strong party of the
Centrifugal Police Force, assisted by the Comets from the out-stations
under Inspector Halley, and a detachment of the South African Asteroids,
(sent by Sir W. Herschel from head-quarters at the Cape,)
the atmospheric pressure was nearly insupportable, and several of
the ladies were nearly absorbed by the crowd. Ceres, Pallas, and
Vesta appeared to suffer intensely; and we deeply regret to state that
one of the Pleiads is still missing, to the great regret of her lovely
sisters and their brilliant circle. The disorderly conduct of a White
Squall (introduced by Mr. Monsoon) was as conspicuous as the undeviating
and steady regularity of the members of the Trades' Union.
Discordant cries of "Adjourn!" "Adjourn to the Milky Way!" quite
drowned the music of the Spheres.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the Planets, the meeting accordingly adjourned
to the Via Lactea. Cassiopea's Chair (kindly lent for the occasion)
was impartially, if not brilliantly, filled by our old and steady friend
the Pole Star; his fair neighbour and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protegée</i>, Aurora Borealis, acted
as secretary, and excited universal admiration by her brilliant
rapidity.</p>

<p>The Man in the Moon then rose, and said he had been deputed by
the Sidereal and Solar System Self-supporting Societies, to lay before
the meeting a statement of their reasons for assembling. His indifference
to all sublunary considerations was well known, and he
was utterly incapable of casting reflections upon any body; but he
must solemnly declare that the constant annoyances and insults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
which he received from his neighbours the Terrestrials were enough
to inflame the temper of a Fixed Star. (Cheers from the Sidereal
benches.) He had heard much of Tellurian attractions; but he was
fortunately not of a warm temperament, and he would never so far
deviate from the orbit of moral rectitude as to yield to them. The
very idea of forming a Tellurian connexion was repulsive to him:
and with his Eccentric tendency, unless he were warmly supported
by the Influential Members of the System, and by that admirable institution
the Centrifugal Force, he trembled for the consequences of
the continuance of such conduct on the part of the Earth; he should
hazard his very Equilibrium, and expose himself to an attack of Parabola.
("Shame!" and groans.) Ever since that scoundrel Daniel
O'Rourke had obtruded himself upon him, he had had no peace:
the sanctity of Sidereal society had been invaded, and the mysteries
of the Lunarian &OElig;conomy unveiled. (Loud cries of "Shame!" from
Mars and Venus.) He had been, in common with many of those
whom he was addressing, travestied at the Terrestrial theatres. (A
voice, "The Olympic!") He had been exposed to the naked eye by
astronomical lecturers, without even the decent intervention of a
spy-glass. Whichever way he turned his phase, they followed him.
But he would proceed at once to that which had principally induced
him to address them; he meant the Monster Balloon (Confusion) and
its crew. (Cries of "Down with 'em!" "Nebulize 'em!" "Tip 'em the
Meteorics!" &amp;c.) Yes, they had defied the elements, violated the
whole of the Gravitation laws, and endangered the stability of the
system itself. (Cheers.) He (the Honourable Lunarian) did not
know where they would stop. Other aeronauts had respected Lunatic
and Sidereal dignity, and had had the decency to perform their
antics by daylight; but these Balloon Monsters, these vile Misouranists
had done it burglariously, and by starlight. He had indeed
been spared the indignity of beholding them; but all celestial security
was at an end, and he did not know when he rose any evening,
whether he should be allowed to set again in peace."</p>

<p>(The worthy Luminary, overpowered by his feelings, sank beneath
the Horizon in a Halo of tears, amidst thunders of applause.)</p>

<p>The Winds rose all at once, and attempted to make themselves
heard; and many of the Siderealists being anxious to neutralize all
opposition, much irregularity and many disturbances ensued, but, the
Fixed Stars surrounding the Chair, and the Centrifugal Force interfering,
order was restored, and</p>

<p><em>Mr. Zephyr</em>, of the Trades' Union, in a scarcely audible whisper,
commenced by expressing his regret at the surface of the meeting
having been ruffled by anything which had <em>fallen from the Moon</em>.
(Coruscations of laughter.) The Moon rose to order. "It was a
vile slander of the grovelling Terrestrials,&mdash;he never let anything fall:
the meteoric stones&mdash;" ("Order, order!") "Mr. Zephyr proceeded.
He had expected a breeze, but was quite unprepared for such a blowing
up. (Cheers.) His own course had been uniformly steady, and
the principles by which he was actuated were now ascertained and
appreciated by high and low. He was neither a Lunatic nor a Terrestrial,
but of the Atmospheric Juste Milieu,&mdash;in short, an Aerialist.
Whilst he opposed all undue Planetary influence, and disliked a Sidereal
ascendency, he abhorred a Vacuum, and was deeply interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
in the stability of the Solar System. He could with confidence appeal
to his worthy neighbours the Tropics, and to the whole constituency
of the Torrid Zone for the confirmation of his assertions.
("Hear, hear!" from Cancer and Capricorn.) He had been accused of
blowing hot and cold, (Ironical cheers from Messrs. Boreas and Auster,)
but that was merely because he was not violent,&mdash;not a regular
Destructive, like some of his neighbours, who were always kicking up
a dust, and never knew when to stop. (Cheers from the Trades.)
But he would no longer deviate from his course. It must, he thought,
be clear to the least reflecting surfaces, that these large meetings had
a tendency to cause disturbances, and to lead to serious irregularities.
Many of the Stars would be out all night, and he feared that some of
their Royal Highnesses the Planets would find it impossible to perform
their necessary revolutions in proper time. How could they expect
to find Honourable Luminaries ready to undertake the onerous
duties of acting as Morning Stars if all this night-work were to be allowed?
How was it possible, for instance, for Jupiter to go his circuit,
or for Georgium Sidus to keep his distance? ("Order!") He
looked upon the Balloon and its crew as mere trifles, light as air.
There was no danger of their rising above their own petty sphere.
It was quite clear that they were within the Gravitation laws: if
they transgressed them, they would be very soon placed <em>in vacuo</em>,
and the full penalty levied under the Newton act. That penalty
amounted to a prohibition, for it not only inflicted sixteen feet perpendicular
for the first second, but went on in a rapidly-increasing
proportion. He must be excused for disbelieving the alleged Eccentricity
of the worthy Luminary who rose last. He thought his anticipations
of premature Parabola mere moonshine; he appeared to
him to have viewed the light in which he was regarded by the Terrestrials
through a most distorted medium. He could assure him
that he had lately become the observed of all observers. The Fixed
Stars were much better appreciated, and were considered as peculiarly
well calculated for their places: even the Nebulæ were beginning
to be properly estimated; and a very graphic account of the
Double Stars had made them better known, and had displayed their
peculiar sympathies, and numerous and unprecedented attractions.
Even the necessity of Periodical Revolutions was now admitted below
as well as above, and there appeared a strong tendency to a system
of Universal Centralization. His worthy friends the Atmospherics
would bear him out in saying that the doctrine of 'Pressure from
without' was understood and acted on to its fullest extent, and that
an important Displacement was generally anticipated. He begged
to be allowed to subside by moving an adjournment <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</i>." (At
this period our reporter was obliged to leave; but we are happy to
say there was every prospect of Mr. Zephyr's motion being carried.)</p>

<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY THE HON. MRS. ERSKINE NORTON.</p>

<p class="linequot">"I could [and will] a tale unfold!"&mdash;<cite>Hamlet.</cite></p>


<p>It is with indignation such only as a literary composition, conscious
of its own high value, and smarting under injustice and neglect, can
be supposed to feel, that I lift up my voice from behind the serried
ranks of my companions, long tales and short, the light effusion of
three pages, or the decided weight of three volumes; serious tales or
gay; moral or profane; fine French or low Irish; tales without an
end, and tales that ought never to have had a beginning; tales in
ponderous verse or in gossamer prose; the delicate and brittle ware
called travellers' tales; or those more substantial and important-looking
matters, political economy tales. I say, that from behind this
prodigious phalanx I rise up like Erskine from behind the big-wigs of
the first law-court he addressed, elevating myself as the young counsellor
on his bench, and making myself heard,&mdash;not, it is true, in the
general cause of justice, liberty, humanity, and so forth, but in that
cause in which all, if not eloquent, are at least earnest and sincere,&mdash;in
the cause of self.</p>

<p>It is said that Minerva (a goddess) sprang from the brain of Jupiter
without a mamma; I, Seraphina (a tale), issued forth from the lovely
head (I am not quite so sure of the brain) of a fair romantic young
lady, without a papa;&mdash;at least so I presume, for my composition is
purely feminine; my slight and delicate texture could only have been
woven by an unassisted female imagination.</p>

<p>While yet in embryo, I was christened Seraphina, and was to be
composed in three or four reasonably long letters (ladies' letters,
crossed and re-crossed with different coloured inks,) to Clementina.
My respected parent decided that there was nothing equal to the
epistolary form for describing the sentiments and adventures of a heroine;
for who like herself <em>can</em> lay open all those finer and minuter
feelings of the inmost heart, pouring into the ear of sympathising
friendship every wish, every hope, every thought? Soul meets soul,
even through the vulgar medium of pens, ink, and paper; "thoughts
that glow and words that burn," are traced by the delicate fingers that
"resume the pen," with a celerity altogether surprising; no agitation
can delay, no fatigue can excuse; the half-dozen sheets of foolscap
that are to be run over before she can lay her throbbing temples on
her pillow, her white drapery (i. e. her night-gown) floating round
her, her long hair unbound (very much out of curl), her snowy feet
on the cold marble (she has lost her slippers), her door carefully
locked, but her trellised casement left open, that the pale moonbeams
may peep through it; her lamp is decaying, her hands are trembling,
her eyes swimming in tears;&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n'importe</i>, the six sheets of foolscap are
finished! O, there is nothing like the epistolary form! Seraphina
shall be in letters to Clementina;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Sure, letters were invented for some wretch's aid,</div>
<div class="verse">Some absent lover, or some captive maid."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I can just recollect, as I began to assume form and consistency,
how much and how dearly I was fondled by my young and doting
mother; indeed, at times, I ran some danger of being killed by kindness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
While transcribing some of the deeply affecting scenes and
sentiments with which I abound, I was nearly obliterated by her tears,
my material parts being composed with a very fine pen and very pale
ink; at other times, when the stronger passions took possession of the
scene, and revenge, hatred, and fury predominated, she would crush
me in her hand, "her eyes in a fine frenzy rolling," and throw me to
the other end of the room. Of course she had some difficulty in
smoothing me out again. Nevertheless I grew in stature, and in
favour with mamma, myself, and four young ladies, her neighbours,
(all under fifteen,) who were at home for the holidays. On the assembling
of this little coterie, I was mysteriously brought forth from
my perfumed drawer, where I lay covered with dried rose-leaves, and
read by the author of my being, in a way in which an author only can
read. My young auditory listened in profound attention and admiration,
secretly resolving that they too would try their unfledged wings
in authorship, when they had left off school and finished their education.
Except to these four interesting girls, my existence was a profound
secret.</p>

<p>My composition is certainly enough to excite emulation, however
hopeless. I am (though I say it myself) an exquisite tale. My heroine
is a model of beauty, virtue, tenderness, and thrilling sensibility;
"a perfect wonder that the world ne'er saw;" therefore the
world ought the more to appreciate so rare a conception. Her mother
was a suffering angel on earth; but, happily for herself, she removed
to a more congenial abode, while her cherub child was yet in
infancy. The surviving parent is, of course, a horrid tyrant, who
cannot comprehend the highly-wrought sensibilities of his daughter,
and therefore will not give way to them. There is the suitor favoured
by the father, and the lover favoured by the daughter. There are a
locking up, an elopement, delicate and dubious situations full of excitement,
misapprehensions of all kinds, a false female friend, libertine
lords, fine unfeeling ladies, dark stormy nights, and a catastrophe of
the most extraordinary, pathetic, and soul-subduing interest. And
then my descriptions of nature! my silver moon and diamond stars!
my rustling trees! my woodbine, jessamine, and violets!</p>

<p>A little conceit I acknowledge to, when copied on pale pink, gilt-edged
paper, curiously ornamented with embossed loves and doves,
written in a neat small running-hand, the tails of my letters prettily
curled, plenty of dashes, and very few stops, I was thus headed:</p>

<p class="center f90">SERAPHINA; OR, SUFFERING SENSIBILITY.<br />
A TALE.<br />
BY A FAIR UNKNOWN.

</div></div></div>

<p class="author"><cite>Lay of the Last Minstrel.</cite></p>

<p>I was highly scented, and sealed in green wax, with a device of Cupid
tormenting a heart.</p>

<p>The dignified Half-yearly was selected for my debut. It rarely
admitted literature of my class, and such only of acknowledged merit;
consequently it was considered my proper and natural medium. From
it, I was to be commented on and extracted in the monthlies, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
in Edinburgh and Dublin as in London; I was to be pirated by the
Americans and translated by the French; and at the end of the year
I was, by express permission, to appear in one of the most fashionable
annuals, my tenderest scene forming the subject of a gorgeous frontispiece,
on which the most celebrated artists were to lavish their talents.
The identification of the "Fair Unknown" was to become the
puzzle of the season; and already many scenes of admiring wonder on
the part of others, and of dignified modesty on her own, had been
played off in the active imagination of my dear parent; the acknowledgement
of Evelina by its young authoress to her father, and the
final recognition of the <em>Great</em> Unknown, were her models.</p>

<p>At length, with this dazzling perspective before me, I was dismissed
from the maternal embrace. Betty the housemaid slipped
with me out of the street-door, holding me with a piece of white
paper between her finger and thumb, to prevent her soiling my envelope;
while my mother watched us from the window with tears in her
eyes. On reaching the twopenny post-office, Betty without any ceremony
pushed me through a slit beneath a window, and, to my great
discomposure, I fell head over heels into a dirty box full of all sorts of
queer-looking epistles. As might be expected, I painfully felt this
my first tumble (for I cannot call it <em>step</em>) into real from imaginary
life. I had scarcely time to recover from the shock before the box
was withdrawn, and we were all turned out by a fat woman on a horrid
thing called a counter, where we were <em>sorted</em>, as she termed it, and
distributed, with a rapidity that was quite confounding, to three or
four shabby-looking men having bags under their arms. I, being the
first turned out, was the last the post-mistress clawed up. She retained
me a full minute, twirled me round, examined my seal, thrust
her great finger between my delicate side folds, and brought me up to
her eye to peer if possible into my inside, when the monster who held
his bag open to receive me, called out,</p>

<p>"Come, mistress,&mdash;can't wait no longer!"</p>

<p>"Well," she replied, "bless me, if this don't look for all the world
like a walentine!" and into the bag she reluctantly dropped me, writhing
as I was with pain and indignation.</p>

<p>When I had somewhat smoothed my ruffled plumes, I ventured to look
round on my fellow-travellers, in search of some congenial spirit with
whom I might beguile the tediousness of time, as we jolted along on the
shoulders of the postman; but I looked round in vain. My nearest
neighbour, to my great annoyance, was a butcher's bill, with whom
every jolt brought me in contact; the dirty thing had a wet wafer
prest down by a greasy thumb. I shrank from it with horror, and fell
back on an epistle from a young gentleman at school, which was
at least clean, and in fair round characters; so I attended to what
it had to say. The date took up a large portion of the paper, and
then: "My dear mamma,&mdash;I have the pleasure to inform you that
our Christmas vacation begins on the 20th. I am very well. I hope
you are very well. I hope my papa is very well; and my brothers
and sisters, my uncles, aunts, and cousins. I beg my duty to my
papa, my love to my brothers and sisters, my respects to my
uncles and aunts, and my remembrances to my cousins; and believe
me your dutiful son." I sighed, and turned to a business-like looking
letter, directed in a precise hand to Messrs. &mdash;&mdash;, in some dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
lane in the city. The names of the persons addressed, and a very
exact date, took up, as in the schoolboy's letter, a vast deal of room,
and then it began: "Gentlemen,&mdash;We beg to acknowledge your
<em>favour</em> of the 1st instant&mdash;" I could not get any further, for I was
suddenly attracted by a smart-looking and very highly scented affair,
sealed, and directed to a lord; but was disappointed on finding
it was only a Bond-street perfumer's little yearly account of one
hundred and fifty pounds for perfumes, fine soaps, cold-cream, and
tooth-brushes. There was no other very close to me, so I ventured
gently to push my way to a curiously folded epistle directed
to Miss Matilda Dandeville, Oxford-street: "Dear Tilly,&mdash;Pray send
me, as soon as you can, my close bonnet, for my nose is nearly off
from wearing my pink silk and blonde this freezing weather. Full
of life and fun here! Shall tell you all when we meet. It will be
your turn next; meantime, business, business! money, money! Love
to all inquiring friends." I felt disgusted. Do not gentlemen and
ladies write by the twopenny-post? Nothing but duns, bills, business,
and money! Is there no sense, sentiment, or sensibility, to
be found in a twopenny-postbag? I certainly did observe some
fashionable-looking letters, and one decidedly with a coronet; but
they were too far down, quite unattainable; so I drew myself up as
much apart as possible from the things by which I was so unhappily
surrounded, and remained the rest of the way in dignified stillness.
My wounded feelings were somewhat soothed by observing the awe,
mingled with curiosity, with which I was regarded; and somewhat
amused by the perfumer's genteel account turning its back on the
butcher's bill, and the lady of the pink and blonde squeezing herself
into a corner to avoid contact with a housemaid. The schoolboy
alone was at perfect liberty,&mdash;and a great annoyance he was,&mdash;evidently
delighting to jumble us all together by a single jump, and
constantly peering at my seal, trying to read my address, and touching
my embossed and gilded edges.</p>

<p>At length we reached our district, and that nervous sound, the
postman's rap, was heard in rapid succession down the street; heads
were popped out at windows, and doors were opened, and pence
ready, before we reached. Out hopped the housemaid, out jumped
the school-boy; and, as my fellow-travellers departed, I sank gradually
lower, until I arrived among the genteel-looking letters I had
spied at a distance; a slight shuffle was perceptible among them:
their black and red seals were erected with great gravity, and my
pink dye became almost crimson when I found that, from the gaiety
of my attire, they evidently thought me "no better than I should
be;" however I had scarcely time to feel uneasy, so swift were our
evolutions, and so completely were we all turned topsy-turvy every
time the postman's hand was introduced among us, and that was every
minute; the big-wigs lost their dignity, and as to me, I felt my seal
crack like a lady's stay-lace; I thought my envelope was torn away,
and that I myself would have been displayed. Shocked at the
very idea of such a catastrophe, I sank senseless to the bottom of the
bag, and only recovered on being violently shaken from it, and hearing
my brutal conductor exclaim: "Why, here it is, to be sure;
and if it isn't the walentine itself, I declare!" He seized his pence,
and, folding up his empty bag, strode off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>I found myself in the hands of a respectable man-servant out
of livery, who, after having examined me with a look of surprise, introduced
me up stairs into rather a dark and heavy drawing-room,
with, however, a cheerful fire, bookcases, and portraits of distinguished
authors. I lay for some time on a circular table, which was covered
with newspapers and periodicals: there was a dead silence; if
I had had a heart, it would have beaten audibly. At length a side-door
opened, and a young gentleman stept in from an adjoining room;
he glanced his eyes over the table, evidently in search of letters from
the post; and, when he saw me, he smiled, and, picking me up,
carried me into the room he had just left. I am sure he must have
felt me tremble in his grasp. In this apartment, the only furniture
was chairs and three writing-tables, the two smaller of which were
occupied by my bearer and another young gentleman; but at that
in the centre was seated a grave elderly personage, rather large in
person, with bushy eyebrows, and keen penetrating eyes. I, who was
extremely ignorant at that time, and had heard much of the knowledge,
power, and dignity of the Half-yearly, without exactly knowing
what it was, took this gentlemen for it himself. My introducer
held me up to his young companion, and a stifled laugh passed between
them; but, recovering his gravity, he laid me on the Half-yearly's
desk, as near under his spectacles as he could bring me
without interrupting his pen. The old gentleman started, frowned,
and, lowering his head, looked at me from above his spectacles, (an
awful way of looking, as is well known,) inquiring gruffly, "What's
this?" "A letter by the twopenny, sir; a lady's verses I should
think, by its appearance." "D&mdash;&mdash; ladies' verses! Take it away."
"Shall <em>we</em> open it, sir?" "Don't pester me!" and in an instant
afterwards he was lost in his important meditations.</p>

<p>The two young gentlemen cut round my seal, and perused the note
of the Fair Unknown, with tears&mdash;but not of sympathy. <em>I</em> was then
taken up, and passages here and there recited in an under-tone with
mock gravity, eliciting, in spite of their dread of their superior, bursts
of irrepressible laughter: these, at last, attracted his attention, and,
looking over his shoulder, he angrily inquired what they were about.
"Pray, sir, do look at this! it is quite a curiosity;" and my note
was handed to him.</p>

<p>"A fair unknown, with that modesty which ever accompanies
genius; with faltering accent, timid step, and eyes that seek the
ground, presumes to lay at the feet of the great Half-yearly the first-born
of her imagination! She prays him not to spurn the babe; but
to take it, cherish it, and usher it into the world!&mdash;It is his own!"</p>

<p>"Mine!" exclaimed the Half-yearly, settling his wig; "I hope she
does not mean to swear it to me; such scrapes are marvellously difficult
to get out of. Wafer up the babe, if you please, gentlemen, in a
sheet of foolscap, (its proper swaddling band,) and add a sentence to
our Notices to Correspondents."</p>

<p>In a few weeks after this memorable scene, my young and tender
parent was at breakfast with her family, when her father entered,
carrying a new Half-yearly, with leaves uncut, and hot from the
press, under his arm. My mother's heart leaped in her bosom, her
face became scarlet, and her mouthful of bread and butter nearly
choked her. Her father dawdled a little over the advertisements
and answers to correspondents: at the latter he smiled. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
amuses you, sir?" inquired his anxious daughter in a tone of forced
calmness: he read, "A Fair Unknown is earnestly requested to send
for her babe immediately; the Half-yearly having no intention of
cherishing, fostering, furthering, or fathering it in any way whatever."
It was well for his thunderstricken auditor that the reader became
immediately too much absorbed in a political paper to notice
the effect of this appalling blow. She made her escape unobserved:
I was instantly sent for, torn from my coarse envelope, and pressed
to her agonised bosom.</p>

<p>Her four friends had returned to school, she could not therefore
have the benefit of their advice and condolence; and, to tell truth, she
did not appear much to regret this circumstance,&mdash;the mortification
of their presence would have been too great.</p>

<p>Betty was not even let into the secret: I was placed in a plain
white envelope, accompanied by a note much less romantic than the
first, addressed to a Monthly; and, being sealed with a more respectable
and well-behaved seal, she hid me in her muff, and dropped me
herself into the same dirty box as before.</p>

<p>The Monthly was not nearly so terrible a person as the Half-yearly.
He was not at home on my arrival in the evening, and I
was laid with several other very literary-looking letters on a table in
his dressing-room, near a good fire, with a lamp ready to light, a pair
of slippers on the hearth-rug, and a large easy chair with a dressing-gown
thrown over it. All this looked sociable and comfortable; and,
feeling quite in spirits, I curtsied respectfully to a moral paper, shook
hands with a political argument, chatted with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprit</i>, and flirted
with a sonnet.</p>

<p>The Monthly returned home about midnight in exceeding good
humour, humming an opera tune; he lit his lamp, donned his dressing-gown,
thrust his feet into his slippers, and, having mused a little
while over the fire, ventured a glance at the table. "The deuce
take it, what a lot there are of them!" he exclaimed; "politics,
morality, and poetry I am not fit for to-night, that's very clear;
something entertaining&mdash;what's this?" (taking up me)&mdash;"a woman's
hand&mdash;prose&mdash;a tale&mdash;just the very thing!" and forthwith I was begun.</p>

<p>Reader, can you imagine&mdash;no, you cannot, so there is no use in
appealing to your sympathy&mdash;the state of agitation I was in? He
read amazingly fast, and hummed and ha'ed as he proceeded; and,
to my utter astonishment, at one of my most pathetic appeals he
burst into a fit of laughter: in short&mdash;I grieve to say it&mdash;but I fear
the Monthly, as indeed he himself had hinted, had indulged a little
too freely,&mdash;had taken a little drop too much; for, soon after this
unaccountable explosion of merriment, he yawned, settled himself
more decidedly in his chair, read very much slower, and at last, on
observing that he turned over two of my pages at once without finding
it out, I ventured to look up, and, behold! his eyes were closing,&mdash;sleep
was creeping over him! I lay aghast, every moment
inclining more and more backwards, till I reposed upon his knee.
The pangs of wounded pride, acute as they were, began to give way
to apprehensions of the most serious nature; his hold momentarily
relaxed, and at length I fell&mdash;fell over the fender, reader! and there
I lay, roasting like a Spanish priest cooked by a French soldier, (the
French, they say, are excellent cooks,) until he should discover the
hidden treasures of his monastery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas! I thought my treasures were lost for ever to the literary
world! There they lay, scorching and melting, until at last fortunately
a cinder, inspired no doubt by the Muses, leapt out to my
protection, and, by destroying a small portion, saved the remainder;
for the smell of fire became so strong, that a servant, who had just
let himself into the house from a high-life-below-stairs party, came
rushing in with a nose extended to its utmost width, rousing and
alarming his sleeping master. "Deuce take it!" exclaimed the
Monthly on perceiving me, "in ten minutes more we should have
been all set on fire by this d&mdash;d <em>soporific</em> (I think that is what he
called me). Who would have thought it had spirit enough to
burn!" The next morning I was despatched home, without a single
line, not even an apology, for my miserable condition.</p>

<p>The curse of Cain was upon me: my own mother (who had become
engaged in the creation of another offspring) received me with mortifying
coolness, and beheld my burnt and disfigured tale with horror
and contempt. She gave up all thoughts of the London annuals,
(her new pet was intended for one of them,) and, having coarsely
repaired me, I was put into the general post, addressed to a country
annual, the "Rosebud" of Diddle-town.</p>

<p>The glowing aspirations of youth were chilled, misfortune had set
her seal upon me; but, although hope was diminished, pride remained
unquelled, for, as I glided over high-ways, and jolted over by-ways,
in the Diddle-town coach, I recalled to my recollection all that I had
heard (especially while I lay smothered up for six weeks on the
learned Half-yearly's table) of the many great luminaries of literature
who had struggled into light and life through the dark and
chilling mists of neglect, ignorance, and envy. I had no doubt but
that I should yet burst forth from my cloud, astonishing and dazzling
the weak eyes which had hitherto refused to encounter, or were incapable
of dwelling upon, my beauty and brilliancy.</p>

<p>On being presented to the Diddle-town editor, he immediately
seized upon me with great glee, and carried me off, without reading
me, to the printer's devil; and, to my utter astonishment, I found
myself in the process of printing an hour after my arrival. Although
this consummation had long been devoutly wished, I cannot say I
was much flattered at its mode.</p>

<p>I appeared in the "Rosebud" of Diddle-town. The editor gave
out that I was the production of a celebrated lady-author, anonymous
on the occasion to all but him. I was demurely listened to by a
coterie of old maids, who, on my conclusion, curtsied to the reader
and curtsied to each other, sighed, and inquired if there were a
picture; I was hummed over by two or three lazy half-pay officers;
I was spelt over by a cottage-full of young lace-makers; and I was
wept over by the Diddle-town milliners' apprentice girls.</p>

<p>But my desire for a larger and nobler sphere of action can no
longer be suppressed: I am determined to make known that I exist,
and to inform the reading world, and all who, like many great philosophers
of old, are eager to seek what they are never likely to find,
that the Tale of Seraphina reposes in all its neglected sweetness, and
unappreciated, because unappreciable beauty, on the leaves of the
"Rosebud" of Diddle-town.</p>

<p class="center f90">A POPULAR TRADITION FROM THE DUCHY OF SAXE-MEININGEN;<br />
TRANSLATED FOR<br />
THE BENEFIT OF THE TEMPERANCE SOCIETIES.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>


<p>Many years ago, our village (Steinbach) and Winterstein (in the
Duchy of Saxe-Gotha) disputed about the common boundaries. Witnesses
were called from both sides; but the dispute could not be
brought to an end, because each of them spoke in favour of his own
village. Amongst these witnesses were two men,&mdash;the one a native
of Steinbach, and the other of Winterstein,&mdash;who had been instructed
in magic by the devil, to whom they had sold their souls.</p>

<p>These two men in one and the same night conceived a resolution
to erect false boundary-stones, to which they intended to give an
appearance of antiquity by the help of magic, so that people might
suppose they had stood there, for many years. Both of them, in the
figures of fiery men, went up the hill where was the boundary in
dispute. Neither of them knew of the intentions of the other.
When they met on the hill, he who arrived the last, asked the other,</p>

<p>"What he was doing there?"</p>

<p>"That is no concern of yours!" answered this; "tell me first what
<em>you</em> are doing here?"</p>

<p>"I will place boundary-stones, and settle the limits as they ought
to be."</p>

<p>"That I have done already, and there you see the stones; and, as
the stones go, so goes the boundary."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, for the boundary goes this way; and my master
told me that I was in the right."</p>

<p>"Pray, who is your master? A fine gentleman must he be!"</p>

<p>"My master is the devil. Are you satisfied now? and do you
feel respect for me?"</p>

<p>"That is a lie! for the devil is <em>my</em> master; and he told me that I
was right: and, therefore, get off as quick as you can, or you shall
see!"</p>

<p>So saying, they threw themselves upon each other; but the man of
our village proved too strong for the other, to whom he gave such
a blow on the mouth that his head flew off and rolled down the
hill. The fiery man without a head quickly ran after it to catch it,
and fix it on again; but he did not succeed in doing so before he arrived
at the spot where the little brook, which flows down the hill,
enters the Emse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, our man, who gave the blow, looked from the hill how
the other chased his own head, when on a sudden a third fiery man
stood before him, who asked,</p>

<p>"What he had done there?"</p>

<p>"That is no concern of yours!" answered our man; "and, if you
do not go your ways immediately, I'll treat you just as I have the
other."</p>

<p>"Have you no more respect for me? and don't you know that I
am your master, the devil?"</p>

<p>"And, if you are the devil himself, I care not a straw for you! Go
to h&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"And that I'll do," said the devil; "but not without you."</p>

<p>Thus saying, the devil stooped to carry him away on his shoulders;
but our man, watching his opportunity, caught his neck between his
two legs, and then, laying his hands on him, and holding him down
to the ground, he said,</p>

<p>"Now you are in my power; and now you shall feel what my
hands are able to do. You have during your life broken the neck of
many a poor man; you shall now learn yourself how it feels!"</p>

<p>Thus saying, he set about to screw the devil's neck round with all
his might; but, when the devil saw that our man was in earnest, he
gave him good words, and prayed him not to do so, and not to smother
him, promising to do anything he might require.</p>

<p>"As I hear you speaking so piteously," said our man, "I'll let you
loose; but not before you have returned to me the bond by which I
sold you my soul. And, moreover, you must swear to me by your
own grandmother, not to claim any part in me; and, during all your
life hereafter, never to take any man's bond for his soul."</p>

<p>The devil, though not pleased with these conditions, yet, for the
safety of his own neck, could not but return the bond, and even
swear by his grandmother what our man had ordered him to do.</p>

<p>But, as soon as the devil found himself free, he jumped on his legs,
and, retiring a few paces lest the other might take him unawares a
second time, he said,</p>

<p>"Now I am free; and now I must tell you that, though I have returned
your bond, and sworn not to claim any part in you, I have not
promised you not to break your own neck; and that I shall do now,
and upon this very spot you shall die for having throttled me, and
for having been about to smother me."</p>

<p>The devil then rushed upon him in order to kill him; but our man
ran away straight into the wood, the devil after him. But, coming
to an old beech which was hollow, and had likewise an opening beneath,
he quickly crept into it and hid himself, and the devil would
have certainly missed him had not his toe peeped out from the hole;
but, his toe being all fiery, and glistening through the darkness, the
devil found out where he had hid himself, and stept near to catch
him by the toe. But he in the tree, hearing him come, dragged back
his toe, and climbed higher up. The devil then crept likewise into
the tree. The other climbed still higher up, and the devil pursued
him, until at last our man reached another hole high up, through
which he crept out. As soon as he was out, he quickly shut the hole,
and jumped as quickly down to fasten the opening below. And this
he did with magic, and did it so well that the devil himself, nor his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
grandmother, could have opened it. Having performed this, he went
his ways.</p>

<p>Thus the devil sat in the old beech-tree, and could not come out,
though he bethought himself for a long time how to do so. Thus he
was kept in the beech; and during that time many of our own people,
when going to Winterstein or coming from it, heard him bleating and
grunting. At last, amongst a large lot of trees, the old beech was
cut down, and the devil regained his freedom. The first thing he did
was to hasten down below, and see how matters stood there. It was as
empty as a church during the week, and not a single soul was to be
heard or seen there; for the devil not having returned for so long a
while, and no one knowing where he was, not a single soul had arrived.
And that broke the heart of the devil's grandmother, who died with
grief; and, when she was dead, all the souls who were then there ran
away, and went straight to heaven. Thus the devil stood quite alone,
without knowing how to get new souls, for he had forsworn to
take the bond of any man more, and this was then the only mode in
which he would get souls. And thus he stood there ruminating, and
was near to pull out his horns from his head with grief and despair,
when he hit upon an idea. While he had been in his beech, which
stood on the old Hart-place, he had, to while away his time, bethought
himself of many things, and amongst others he invented brandy. That
he remembered in the midst of his grief, and he conceived at once
it would be the best means of getting hold of new souls.</p>

<p>He immediately went to Nordhausen, and made himself a distiller;
and burnt brandy as much as he could, which he sent into
all the world. And he showed to all the men of Nordhausen how
brandy was made, promising them great riches if they learnt it,
and made brandy like him. And the men of Nordhausen did not
oblige him to say it twice, for they all became distillers, and made
brandy like him. And thus it happened that to the present day
there is no other place in the world where there is so much of brandy
burned as at Nordhausen.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>And so it turned out as the devil expected. Whenever people
got a little brandy into their stomachs they began to swear, and
d&mdash;d their souls to the devil; so that the devil got them when
they were dead without taking any bond from them, and without serving
them, as he was obliged to do before, when he sought a man's soul.
When the brandy rose into their heads, they collared each other, and
fought, and broke their necks; so that the devil was saved all the
trouble he had had before in wringing them. And, if the devil had
had before the greatest pains to be imagined in order to get a poor
soul a week for his hell, they came now by their own accord by dozens
and scores every day; and scarcely a year passed before hell was too
small to hold them. The devil was then obliged to build a new hell at
the side of the old one, for the sake of giving them accommodation.</p>

<p>In one word, since the devil got loose from the beech on the Hart-place,
since that time brandy was introduced into the world; and,
since we have brandy, it may be said "that the devil is loosened,"
as our proverb goes.</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="THE_WIT_IN_SPITE_OF_HIMSELF" id="THE_WIT_IN_SPITE_OF_HIMSELF"></a>THE WIT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF.</h2>

<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY RICHARD JOHNS.</p>


<p>Reader, are you a wit? If so, are you a whit the better for so
being?</p>

<p>The mere imputation of being a facetious fellow has cost me so
dearly, that I can well imagine what fearful consequences the actual
possession of a real patent from the court of Momus involves. For
mine own part, I may truly say <em>my</em> offences against the gravity of
society ought to have been denominated accidents. Unwittingly
have I offended: I have no pretension to the art of "making a good
hit," cutting up a private acquaintance or a public character, "backbiting,"
or giving "a slap in the face." I am no alchymist at retorts,
to be able to transmute the missile aimed at me, into a crown of triumph.
If I say a sharp thing, it is because I did not perceive its
point; or I would not have meddled with it. I never had the knack
of running other men's jokes to death by clapping riders to them;
and as to mine own, such as they are, any one is welcome to the
credit of them who will take their responsibilities.</p>

<p>But, ere the speculative reader closes the bargain, let him "listen
to my tale of woe." My father was a wit and a man of letters: he
proved his good sense by marrying a fool,&mdash;I beg my mother's pardon;
she died soon after I was born, and I only judge by the character she
left behind her, to say nothing of her MS. poems and common-place
book, which I inherited. When ten years of age, I lost my remaining
parent, he being killed in a duel arising out of a christening-dinner;
on which occasion he originated the <em>now</em> standing joke of wishing the
heir "long life to be a better man than his father." The worthy
host, who was here hinted at, in his relational position, conceiving the
expression implied not only an impossibility, but an impertinence, my
progenitor was called out, and incontinently sent home again with a
hole pinked in his body, which let the existence out of the wittiest
man of his day. With such an example before my mental eyes of the
consequences of being a bright ornament of society, is it to be wondered
that I determined to be the dullest dolt in my school? Alas!
it was declared by all, that a "Winkings" must be a wit and a clever
fellow, in spite of my endeavours to prove the contrary.</p>

<p>If I committed the most egregious blunders in my class, there was
always somebody to say, "Winkings knows better; he is a wag,&mdash;a
dry dog; very like a whale, that he can't answer such a simple question;"
and the cheek of the "dry dog" was often wetted by tears;
and the "wag" found the jest no joke; and, if my ignorance was
"very like a whale," it was one on mine own shoulders, since, if I
really knew better, I certainly got the worst of it. I have been flogged
one moment for pretending to be obtuse, when there was no pretence
in the matter; and the next, for saying impudent things to the
dominie, which I had never intended. I unconsciously quizzed the
ushers, to mine own disgrace; while the writing-master declared, if
ever I <em>did</em> write, it must be without tuition and by intuition, for I
was too busy making the other boys laugh, or worrying them till they
cried, to attend to my copy. Such was my character at a school
which I quitted early in my nonage, having persuaded my guardians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
that my education was complete, out of sheer compassion to my master.
Had I not left his school, there was a probability of my being
his only scholar, so numerous were the complaints from my schoolfellows'
parents of "that mischief-making, sly, quarrelsome, impudent
little scapegrace, Master Sam Winkings, who, from all they had heard,
seemed quite enough to corrupt a whole school." Thus early did
my unhappy destiny develope itself; people would have it that I was
always saying or imagining evil of them, setting others by the ears
for the fun of the fight, and jesting and sneering at all the world
holds sacred and respectable.</p>

<p>But in those days unjust accusations were of little consequence to
me; if strangers belied me, my immediate relatives were then proud
of my "facetious ways," and my "dry humour,&mdash;so like his poor father!"
Thus lauded and encouraged, matters were at one time going
on so pleasantly that I had some intention of favouring the deceit my
friends seemed determined to put on themselves, and, professing myself
a wit, take all the honours for my fortuitous smart sayings, rather
than be accused of affectation in eternally denying them. The
tables, however, were soon turned; and it was well I still stuck to
the truth, or disasters might have more speedily befallen me. As it
was, I in due course of time offended matter-of-fact uncles by jests
that I was unconscious of; shocked the ears of fair cousins by <em>double
entendre</em> most unmeaningly; and robbed maiden aunts of their good
names, when I really meant to compliment their virtues.</p>

<p>But I will at once individualize my misfortunes, and I feel assured
of the reader's sympathy. "Sam," said my uncle John, as he was
breakfasting with me at my chambers in the Temple, where I did
<em>nothing</em>, with an air of business: having been called to the bar, "I
want to ask your advice; but you really are such a facetious fellow,
that you even laugh at a man's misfortunes."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, you wrong me," I replied, anxious to justify myself,
for I was his reputed heir. "Only state your case, and I will give
you as good advice as if I were your fee'd counsel."</p>

<p>"Well, Sam, you must in the first place know," said the old gentleman,
"that I shall be obliged to stand an action for assault."</p>

<p>"Sorry for it, uncle: I hope it is not a bad action on your part,
or we had better&mdash;&mdash;" I was going to add "compromise, rather than
go into court;" but my worthy relative, who was about one of the
most irritable men in existence, interrupted me.</p>

<p>"Confound you, sir! when <em>will</em> you leave off your puns? What
bad action did I ever commit in the whole course of my life?"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, uncle, you quite misunderstand me," apologised I,
wishing to explain.</p>

<p>"No, I don't, Sam," retorted he, shaking his head; "your unhappy
propensity is too well known. But I will forgive you this
once; only <em>do</em> be serious. I tell you, boy, it may cost me a cool hundred,
besides expenses."</p>

<p>I again assured him that I was all attention; and as he threw himself
back in his chair, in preparation for a lengthy detail, I quietly
continued my breakfast, only occasionally putting in a "Yes,"
"Truly," "Really," and so on, as Uncle John paused for breath.</p>

<p>"I was down at Brighton last week, as you know, Sam: had a
dreadful headache, and thought a shower-bath would do me good; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
went to the new baths. An attendant almost ran against me in the
hall. 'Shower-bath,' said I. 'Yes, sir, in a moment, sir; hot or
cold?' 'A hot shower-bath!' exclaimed I in the very extremity of
surprise. 'I am not used to be jested with, young man.' The fellow
stared as if he did not half understand me; but brushed off, and I
walked into the waiting-room. My head throbbed with pain, and not
a little with perplexity at what the fellow could mean by a hot
shower-bath; I had never heard of such a thing, and thought the
rogue was quizzing me. Well, Sam, to go on with my story, I was
soon ushered into a little bathing-room, with its tall sentry-box, by
the same man I had at first spoken to. 'Get more towels,' said I:
there were only three. 'Yes, sir,' and away went my gentleman;
while I stripped, and shut myself up in the bath. For the life of me,
I could not muster resolution enough, just at first, to pull the string.
It is no joke, Sam, to stand the shock of a deluge of cold water. I
can assure you it always seems to make my red face hiss again."</p>

<p>"No doubt, sir," said I inadvertently.</p>

<p>"Young gentleman," slowly enunciated my uncle, drawing himself
up to his full height in his seat, as if to give greater gravity to his words
by causing them to fall from an increased altitude, "it is not becoming
in <em>you</em> to make such a remark, though <em>I</em> may choose to be a
little facetious on myself. You need not excuse yourself," he added,
seeing I was about to reply; "it is your infirmity; but your wit will
one day be your only portion."</p>

<p>What could I do?&mdash;I sighed, let Uncle John go on with his narrative,
and helped myself to an egg.</p>

<p>"Well, nephew, if you can keep from your jokes for a moment, I
will come at once to the assault. I had at last made up my mind to
endure the cold shock, so I pulled the cord. Never shall I forget it:
down came at least six gallons of boiling water! Yes! I am sure it
was boiling: the fellow had done it to spite me. The rascal was entering
the room with the towels at that very moment, and I <em>had</em> my
revenge. I dashed open the door and seized him by the neck. I
kicked him, I cuffed him; he cried out 'Murder!' 'You ordered
hot water, sir!' I called him a liar, and knocked his head against
the wall."</p>

<p>Here my uncle became so animated, that he seemed inclined to
enact his story. Reader, I have mentioned that I had helped myself
to an egg. Now, there has long been a question as to the proper
mode of boiling eggs. I like them put into cold water: thus, by the
heat being gradually introduced, the shell is prevented from cracking.
My man, on the contrary, is for plunging the egg into water at boiling-point.
Obstinate fellow! his perverseness on this occasion cost
me a thousand a-year and a house in Lancashire. Uncle John was
dashing out his hand towards my wig, which, in all the majesty of
curls, decorated a block on the side-table, no doubt fancying that he
was again going to throttle the knight of the bath, and I had just discovered
my egg-shell full of vile slimy fluid, instead of the luxurious
yolk and white it would have contained had my rascal obeyed directions.
Behold the consequences! My uncle sprang half out of
his seat in the frenzy of scalding recollections; while I on the opposite
side of the table rose in an agony of vexation, exclaiming "Cracked!
cracked! D&mdash;the fellow, always in hot water!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<p>Reader, did you ever happen to say an ill-natured thing of a person
whom you supposed to have just left the room, but who, in point
of fact, not having progressed many yards from the back of your
chair, suddenly confronts you to thank you for the attention; if so,
you may imagine my uncle's sarcastic acknowledgments. "Thank
you, sir; I am very much obliged to you," said the old man, in a moment
recovering himself from his menacing attitude; "I humbly
thank you. Your wit, sir, will make your fortune. I am cracked,
am I? I am always in hot water?" Then, changing his tone as he
stalked from his chair to possess himself of his hat, he thundered
out, "Mr. Samuel Winkings, no longer nephew of mine,&mdash;if a scurvy
jest is all your sympathy for your invalid uncle, jeered at and parboiled
by a rascally bath waiter, I wish you a very good morning!"</p>

<p>In vain I interposed between the old gentleman and the door; I
essayed to explain; I offered to put myself, my servant, upon oath;
he would not listen to me. He declared all wits were liars,&mdash;that I
had provoked him past bearing; and away he went, and away went
my hopes in that quarter. Never did he forgive me. He died last
week, and the only mention he favours me with, in his will, runs thus:
"To Samuel Winkings I leave nothing; he can doubtless live by
his wit, and I would not insult him by making him any other provision."</p>

<p>Though Uncle John had discarded me, still Aunt Jemima, a legacy-huntress
all her life, could not carry her quarry to earth with her.
She must in her turn make a bequest; and it was at one time thought
this would be in my favour, till, in an unluckly hour, I irretrievably
lost my place in her good graces. Aunt Jem, as she was familiarly
called by her nephews and nieces, had "great expectations" from Miss
Julia and Miss Maria Beech, very rich ancient maidens, sufficiently
her seniors to make it worth while to calculate what they would
leave behind them. Of course my aunt laid herself out in every
possible way to conciliate these ladies; indeed, among all their acquaintance,
her anxiety to please them was only rivalled by a Mr.
Smith, an elderly gentleman living at Barking, in Essex. He, like
Aunt Jem, took great pleasure in toadyism, though wealthy enough
to have afforded himself much more respectable amusements. There
was a cross-fire of invitations, and a grand struggle every Christmas
between the lady and gentleman legacy-hunters for the possession of
the Misses Beech; and, during a stay I was making last year at my
aunt's abode in Hampshire, I found that, yielding to her superior
powers of persuasion, the worthy spinsters were her own from the approaching
Christmas-eve even until Twelfth-day. "Then they positively
<em>must</em> go to Mr. Smith; he was so pressing, and made <em>such</em> a
point of it." This delightful announcement was conveyed in a letter
to mine aunt, received at breakfast-time, and triumphantly read to
me.</p>

<p>"They each of them bring their own maid," said the hospitable
lady as she conned over their epistle; "but I do not mind the expense
nor the trouble; the Beeches are such pleasant companions.
I dare say they won't die worth less than twenty thousand pounds apiece.
Now I hope you intend to make yourself agreeable, Sam.
Let us have none of your jests and your dry sayings. They are&mdash;they
are staid, serious persons, and don't like such things, but are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
partial to sensible conversation. If I recollect right, the last time
Miss Julia was here, she told me she had three thousand pounds in
the Long Annuities. Both she and her sister treat me with the greatest
confidence. I only wish they would not go to Barking so soon.
If we were to make things very agreeable to them, who knows, Sam,
but they might break their engagement with that mercenary Mr.
Smith?"</p>

<p>Thus ran on my aunt, while I silently acquiesced in all she said.</p>

<p>"Why, Sam, you do not seem pleased at the prospect of company!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, aunt," replied I, "I was only thinking you would like
my <em>room</em>."</p>

<p>"Will you have <em>done</em> with your jests?" said Aunt Jem, suspecting
a joke in my literal offer, I knowing that ladies' maids are often more
fastidious as to their bedchambers than their mistresses.</p>

<p>"It is very provoking," exclaimed I in a pet, "that you always
think I am making some foolish pun. I only wish to do <em>my</em> part towards
rendering your guests and their attendants comfortable. You
know what a fuss they make about their servants; turning the house
into a hospital for the slightest cold, and talking of 'dear Mr. Smith's
cough medicine!' I was only thinking what I could do, to keep the
Beeches from Barking."</p>

<p>I suppose, in my haste to exculpate myself from the charge of punning,
I could not have taken due care to elongate the <em>proper</em> name of
the fair spinsters, and, doubtless, it must have sounded a most <em>improper</em>
one in the ears of my aunt; for her little eyes seemed actually
to emit sparks, as a black cat's back is said to do when ruffled in the
dark.</p>

<p>"They are gentlewomen, Mr. Winkings!" cried Aunt Jem, almost
choked with indignation, "and their attendants are respectable young
persons, while <em>you</em> are a disgrace to your family. For shame! for
shame!" emphatically continued the angry lady, interrupting the
excuses I attempted to make; "I will not listen to you. I beg you
will leave my house immediately. Your room is indeed most desirable,
as you just now so wittily remarked. I would not subject my
friends to the insolent licence of your tongue for worlds!"</p>

<p>Away marched Aunt Jem with the strut of an incensed turkey-cock,
and an hour afterwards, I was on my way back to London; nor
have I ever been able to convince my mistaken relative of my innocence,
and still do I remain under the ban of her displeasure.</p>

<p>It would be wearying the reader to state all I have lost, and all I
have suffered from the imputation of being a droll; and so I will content
myself with one more instance of my unhappy fatality.</p>

<p>Not long ago I dined with Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, who, though he certainly
does not bear the character of being over bright, was still to me a
star of great promise, seeing that he had given me assurance of provision
under the operation of the "poor laws' bastard legislation," or
some such affair, I forget exactly what, since unfortunately it is now
no affair of mine.</p>

<p>The dinner in question was the only one I ever got out of his lordship,
who on this occasion merely asked me, I believe, on account of
my reputation for drollery. In fact, I was intended to be the jack-pudding
of the company; but I determined to eat much and say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
little, for fear of giving offence. This did not suit his lordship, who
considered my silence during the early part of the dinner as so much
time lost, many of the party having been asked to meet the facetious
Sam Winkings.</p>

<p>"We have just had a discussion here," smiled Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, in his
attempt to draw me out, "as to the impossibility of real wit making a
rankling wound, it being like the clean cut of a razor. For myself, I
am but a fool in such matters. What do <em>you</em> say, Mr. Winkings?"</p>

<p>"That I am quite of your lordship's opinion," replied I, most deferentially.</p>

<p>Here, a fit of coughing went round the table, which might or might
not have covered a laugh; but looks were exchanged, plainly showing
me that something was wrong. Little did I think at the time that,
in delivering myself of my first actual sentence, in my hurry to agree
with our host, I had called him a noodle. The peer was the only
one who indulged in a decided cachinnation. Even he did not laugh
comfortably; and I began to imagine that I had made one of my
unlucky hits.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, my lord; I only meant perfectly to agree with
your lordship," said I, crossing my knife and fork over a delicious
slice from a haunch of Southdown, for which my embarrassment had
taken away all relish.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, Mr. Winkings," rejoined Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, getting
up a fresh laugh; "I am sorry I disturbed you till after dinner. You
don't like 'to eat mutton cold.' How goes the quotation?"</p>

<p>"'And cut blocks with a razor,' my lord," replied I, with the most
imperturbable gravity.</p>

<p>The sensation was immense. Several of the guests palpably scowled
at me, as if I had been guilty of an impertinence towards our
host. Some stifled their risibility, and others laughed outright. Alas!
what had I done? Just helped him to the remembrance of a quotation
which there can be no doubt his lordship had forgotten, except
as it referred to mutton. But I had the reputation for sarcasm, and
of course I had made a personal attack on Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, who, acting
under this impression, certainly passed the matter off with a great
deal of urbanity.</p>

<p>"Glad you hit him so hard," said a caustic old gentleman on my
right. "Can't bear to see men of wit asked to be funny. My lord
had much better have let well alone."</p>

<p>"In the name of Heaven, sir," cried I, almost at my wits' end,
"what <em>have</em> I done?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you're a wag," said the caustic old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, I am not a wag, but the most unfortunate individual
in the world."</p>

<p>My neighbour was convulsed with laughter; and it was not until
we left my lord's house after that luckless dinner that I elicited from
him the particulars of my offence. His lordship has, like my uncle
and aunt, of course, left me to live by my wits; fortunately, my caustic
little friend thinks they will stand me in excellent stead. He has
taken the place of my offended patron, and has actually introduced me
to a publisher, for whom I am just now engaged in editing a new
edition of facetiæ, in two volumes quarto, comprising the complete
reminiscences of the celebrated Joseph Miller.</p>

<h3>THE LEGEND OF BALLAR.</h3>


<p>The most ancient of the kings of Torry was Ballar the Dane. If
tradition does him no injustice, a worse specimen of royalty could not
be found among the Holy Alliance. His manners were anything but
amiable; his temper violent; his disposition sanguinary and revengeful;
while, in his notions regarding the doctrines of "meum and
tuum," there was not a looser gentleman of his day.</p>

<p>In personal appearance Ballar was dark, stern, and gigantic; and,
in an excess of her bounty, Nature had been graciously pleased to
gift him with a third eye. This extra optic was placed in the back
of his head; and such was the malignity of its influence that one
glance extinguished animal life, a forest was withered by a look,
and all those bare and herbless hills upon the mainland which lie in
scattered groups beneath the scathed pinnacles of Arygle, may&mdash;if
tradition can be trusted&mdash;date their barrenness to an optical visitation
they underwent from their dangerous neighbour the king of
Torry. As, even in the darkest character some lighter shading may
be found, Ballar,&mdash;to give the devil his due,&mdash;perfectly aware of the
destructive properties of his third eye, kept it carefully concealed by
a curtain.</p>

<p>Ballar had "one fair daughter, and no more," and an oracle had
foretold that, unless killed by his grandson, he should exist for ever.
Determined to outlive Methuselah, Ballar resolved on leaving his
native country, and seeking out some abiding place where the celibacy
of the young lady might be secured. Accordingly he set out
upon his travels, and, after an extensive tour, visited Donegal, and
chose Torry for his residence; and, faith! a <em>nater</em> spot for a gentleman
who wished retirement could not have been selected. There
he built a castle for himself, and a prison for his daughter. To
"make all right," the young lady was placed under the <em>surveillance</em>
of twelve virgins; whence the latter were obtained, history doth not
say.</p>

<p>Ballar's nearest neighbours on the main were called Gabshegonal,
and Kien Mac Caunthca. The latter was possessed of two brave
boys, while the former was owner of a white heifer: Glassdhablecana,
or "the grey-flanked cow," was the envy of the country. Nothing
from Dingle to Donegal could match her; she was a dairy in herself;
and Ballar, regardless of justice, and not having the fear of the
going judge of assize before him, determined to abstract her if he
could. Like other autocrats, he found no difficulty in trumping up a
title, for he asserted that those resident on the mainland were his
vassals, and claimed and exacted certain seignorial rights, which,
much to the satisfaction of persons entering into matrimony, have
been allowed to sink into desuetude.</p>

<p>Like those of all bad monarchs, his ministers were no better than
himself; and the chiefs of his household, Mool and Mullock, were
worthy agents of their three-eyed master. As his demand upon
Gab's cow had been peremptorily rejected, the tyrant of Torry determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
to obtain by fraud, what force could not effect; and Mool and
Mullock received instructions accordingly.</p>

<p>Ballar's intentions having transpired, Gabshegonal assumed the defensive,
and called to his assistance the sons of Kien Mac Caunthca.
Gab, it appears, was the most celebrated sword-cutler of his day,
and he promised to forge a weapon for each of the young men; they
undertaking, in return, to watch the grey-flanked cow for a given
time.</p>

<p>The elder of the Mac Caunthcas performed his part of the contract
with the smith, and obtained the promised sword; and the
younger commenced watch and ward in turn. For some time his vigilance
secured the white cow; but, unhappily, it occurred to the
youth that it would be desirable to have his name engraved on the
sword-blade which Gab was then polishing. He ran to the forge to
make his wishes known; and, short as his absence was, alas! upon his
return the cow was gone! The spoilers were discovered from the top
of Arygle; the younger Mac Caunthca observed Mool and Mullock
driving Glassdhablecana along the beach; and, without his being able
to overtake them, they embarked for Torry with their prey. Enraged
at the occurrence, the smith retained the elder brother as a hostage,
and swore that, if the cow were not recovered, he would behead him,
to avenge her loss.</p>

<p>The unhappy watchman, overwhelmed with grief and shame, fled
from his home, and wandered recklessly along the rock-bound coast.
To reach Torry was impossible, and he abandoned himself to sorrow
and despair.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a little red-haired man appeared unexpectedly at his elbow,
and with sympathetic civility inquired the cause of his lamentations.
Mac Caunthca informed him of the misfortune, and the red
dwarf offered his condolence, and volunteered to assist him to reach
the island. Mac embraced the little gentleman and his offer; and,
having ascended the summit of Cruicknaneabth, he placed his foot upon
the dwarf's hand, who rose with him into the air, and, passing over
the small islands between Torry and the main, fast as the wind
itself, landed in safety beneath the castle walls of Ballar. Both the
youth and his conductor were "the nonce" rendered invisible. With
little difficulty the cow was found; and the dwarf engaged that, ere
morning, she should be safely returned to her lawful owner, the honest
sword-cutler, Gabshegonal.</p>

<p>Whether the little gentleman with the red beard preferred daylight
for his aërial trips, does not appear; but, certain it is, that his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protegé</i> remained that night upon the island, and was introduced by
the obliging dwarfs to the prison of the princess, where he remained
until dawn broke. Safely was he then conducted to the place he had
left on the preceding evening. The red man took an affectionate
leave. The grey-flanked cow was before him at the owner's. His
brother was released; the promised sword honestly delivered by the
maker; and the whole adventure ended prosperously.</p>

<p>Time rolled on. Nine months had elapsed since his visit to the
island, when the young Mac Caunthca was honoured by a call
from the little red gentleman, who requested his company to make
a morning call upon the imprisoned princess. They crossed the arm
of the sea with the same rapidity that marked their former flight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
and, on entering the well-remembered tower, what was Mac Caunthca's
delight and surprise on finding that he was the father of a large
and healthy family! The princess had just given birth to a son; and
the twelve young ladies, following, as in duty bound, the example of
their mistress, had each produced "a chopping boy."</p>

<p>But, alas! the pleasures of paternity were speedily ended. Ballar
detested children. Twins would drive a Malthusian distracted; and
what apology could be offered for thirteen? Nothing remained but
to remove the young Mac Caunthcas in double-quick; and the dwarf,
with his usual good nature, proposed the means. A curragh<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> was
procured; the tender pledges of the maids of honour were placed
in a blanket, and fastened by skewers upon the back of their papa,
while the heir to the throne was accommodated in a separate cloth;
and with this precious freight the curragh was launched upon the
ocean.</p>

<p>Presently the wind freshened, the sea rose, and the frail bark was
tossed upon the surface of an angry sea. In the fury of the gale the
skewers that secured the blanket gave way; overboard went the progeny
of the virgin body-guard; and the young Mac Caunthca
reached the mainland with a single son, the heir-presumptive to the
throne of Torry.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that the care of an infant would have become
a very troublesome charge upon the lover of the island princess;
but here, too, the red man stood his friend. The dwarf volunteered
to educate the child seven years, then hand him over
to his father for seven more, when he, Red-beard, would again receive
him for other seven; and thus the grandson of the three-eyed
monarch would be disposed of, during nonage. It was done. The
boy grew apace; and, indoctrinated at the feet of a gifted Gamaliel
like little Red-beard, it is not surprising that the heir of Torry became
a finished gentleman.</p>

<p>His first appearance in public is stated to have been at a country
wedding; and there Ballar, attended by Mool and Mullock, and his
customary suite, was punctual to claim his prerogative. Shocked at
the immorality of his grandfather, the dwarf's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protegé</i> remonstrated
with the old gentleman in vain; and, to strengthen his arguments,
imprudently confessed the degree of relationship in which they stood.
Furious at the discovery, the ancient sinner determined on the youth's
destruction; he raised his hand to uncurtain the third eye, but his
grandson burst from the house, and ran for shelter to the forge of
his relative, Gabshegonal. A hot pursuit took place. Ballar and
his "tail" pressed the fugitive closely; and the youth had only time
to arm himself with a heated bar, when his truculent relation, with
his train, rushed in. Before the eye could be uncovered, by one
lucky thrust the heir of Torry annihilated its evil influence, and
thus proved satisfactorily that the worst of eyes is no match for red-hot
iron.</p>

<p>But, even in death, Ballar evinced no feelings of Christian forgiveness.
Calling his grandson to his side, he requested that he would
abridge his sufferings by cutting off his head; and then, by placing
it upon his own, he assured him that all the knowledge he, Ballar,
possessed, should directly be transferred to his grandson, and descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
like an heir-loom in the family. With the first part of the
request the young gentleman freely complied; but, being awake to
the trickery of his grandsire, he prudently resolved to see what
effect the head would have upon stone before he tried the experiment.
The result proved that his suspicions were well-founded. A
drop of poisonous matter fell from the head upon the rock; and a
broken cliff is pointed out upon the island, said to have been disrupted
by the head of Ballar resting on it.</p>

<p>The remainder of the legend is happy, as it should be. The
princess in due time became a wife; her son danced at the wedding;
and the maids of honour were provided with husbands, and, though
rather tardily, were "made honest women of" at last. No longer
necessitated to commit their offspring to the ocean by the dozen,
their progeny increased and multiplied; and from the Danish princess,
and the virgin train who "bore her company," the present inhabitants
of Torry believe themselves to be immediately descended.</p>

<h3 class="space-above2"><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_CHURCH_OF_THE_SEVEN" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_CHURCH_OF_THE_SEVEN"></a>
LEGEND OF THE CHURCH OF THE SEVEN.</h3>


<p>After a dreadful tempest, seven dead bodies, six of which were
male and one female, were found upon the western shore of the
island, with a stone curragh and paddle beside them: both the latter
had been broken against the rocks. The inhabitants speedily collected,
and a consultation took place as to the manner in which the
bodies of the unknown strangers should be disposed of. The opinions
of the islanders were divided: some proposed that they should be
interred, others contended that they should be committed to the
waves again; but it was unanimously resolved, that on no account
should they be buried in the churchyard, as they might not have
been true Catholics. To bury was the final determination. A grave
was accordingly prepared, the seven corpses were indiscriminately
thrown in, and the trench closed up.</p>

<p>Next morning, to the great surprise of the islanders, the body of
the female was found separated from those of her unfortunate companions,
and lying on the surface of the ground. It was believed
that the lady had been disinterred by that party who had opposed
the bodies being buried on the island, and the corpse was once more
returned to its kindred clay, and the grave securely filled up.</p>

<p>The second morning came, and great was the astonishment of the
inhabitants when it was ascertained that the same occurrence had
taken place, and the grave had surrendered its dead. The body was
inhumed once more, and, to guard against trickery, and secure the
corpse from being disturbed, a watch was placed around the grave.</p>

<p>But when the daylight broke on the third morning, lo! the body
of the unknown had again burst its cerements, and lay once more
upon the surface of the ground. The vigilance of the guard had
proved unavailing, and the consternation of the islanders was unbounded.
A grand conclave assembled, and, after much consideration
and debate, it was decided that the departed female had been a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">religieuse</i>;
and, that as she had eschewed all communion with the coarser sex
while living, so, true to her vows, even after death she had evaded the
society of man. Believing her to be a gentlewoman of extra holiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
who had departed "in the pride of her purity," it was shrewdly conjectured
that there was nothing to prevent her from working miracles.
The sick were accordingly brought forward, and a touch
from the blessed finger of the defunct nun&mdash;for such she proved&mdash;removed
every malady the flesh is heir to, and left the island without
an invalid. To atone for the irreverential mode in which the lady
had been treated on former occasions, a magnificent funeral was decreed
her; a stone monument was erected over the sainted remains;
and, that posterity should not be excluded from the virtues of her
clay, an opening was left in the south side of the tomb, whence the
faithful could obtain a portion of her ashes, and the sick be cured of
their ailments. It being considered that one so particular after death
would not, when alive, have ventured upon sea with any but the
servants of religion, the other six bodies were honourably interred,
and a tomb raised to their memory, while "the Church of the Seven"
was built to their joint honour, and dedicated to the whole.</p>

<p>To this day the sanctity of the lady's grave remains unimpaired.
The ashes retain their virtue; the pious resort thither to pray, the
sick to procure relief from their sufferings. When it is necessary to
obtain the holy dust for devout or medicinal purposes, application is
made to the oldest member of a particular family, who have enjoyed
from time immemorial the blessed privilege of dispensing the saint's
clay. The name of the family is Doogan; and the reason why this
high prerogative rests with this favoured lineage is, because their
ancestors were the first converts of St. Colomb Kill, and the first of
the islanders who received baptism at his hands.</p>

SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LEGENDS OF THE TORRY
ISLANDERS.</h3>


<p>Torry Island, situated on the north-west coast of Ireland, is probably
the least known of any of her Majesty's European possessions.
Although so near the main, the communication is difficult and infrequent.
The island has but one landing-place, and that can only
be entered with leading winds, while, during the prevalence of the
others, it is totally unapproachable.</p>

<p>Within the memory of people still alive, the natives of Torry were
idolaters. They were ushered into life, and quitted it for the grave,
without either rite or ceremony. Marriage was, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Martineau</i>, nothing
but "a civil contract," and their notions of the Deity, rude and
untutored as Kamschatdales or New Zealanders. Latterly, priests
from the main have occasionally landed on the island, and there introduced
the formulæ of religion; but visits dependent on winds and
waves are "few and far between," and the state of Torry may still be
termed more than demi-savage. When some adventurous beadsman
ventures on a clerical descent, during his brief sojourn he finds that
his office is no sinecure: children are to be christened by the score;
and couples, who took each other's words, to be married by the dozen.
During the long interregnum, a large arrear of omitted ceremonies
has accrued, and the daring clerk returns from this "ultima Thule" a
weary, if not a wiser man.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more wretched than the appearance of the island
and its inhabitants: the one, cold, barren, and uncultivated; the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
ugly, dwarfish, and ill-shapen. The hovels are filthy to a degree; and
all within and about Torry is so sterile and inhospitable, that a dread
of being wind-bound deters even the hardiest mariner from approaching
its rock-bound shores.</p>

<p>That "holy men" should venture among the Heathen, is, as it
ought to be; and that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i> will go desperate lengths to obtain
bones, oyster-shells, and other valuable commodities, is equally true.
For spiritual and scientific Quixotes, Torry opens an untried field;
and any philosopher who can digest dog-fish, and possesses a skin
impervious to entomological assaults, may here discover unknown
treasures: none having yet been found&mdash;for none have sought them.</p>

<p>It was, probably, expectations such as these that induced the late
Sir Charles Geisecke to visit this unfrequented island. Whether his
geological discoveries compensated his bodily sufferings, the gentleman
who perpetrated his biography leaves a scientific mystery. Certain
it is, that in after-life the worthy knight never touched upon this
portion of his wanderings without shuddering at the recollection.</p>

<p>Three days he sojourned among the aborigines, and three nights
he sheltered in the chief man's hovel. He left Ards House<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in good
spirits, and fat as a philosopher should be; and when he returned,
his own dog, had he possessed one, would not have recognised his
luckless owner. He came out a walking skeleton, and the ablutions
he underwent would have tried the patience of a Mussulman. He
had lost sleep; well, that could be made up for. He lost condition;
that too might be restored. But to lose hair, to be clipped like a
recruit, and have his garments burned at the point of a pitch-fork,&mdash;these
indeed would daunt the courage of the most daring entomologist.</p>

<p>Pat Hegarty, the knight's guide, used to recount the sufferings
they underwent. Their afflictions by day were bad enough; but
these were nothing, compared to their nocturnal visitations. "My!
what a place for fleas!" said an English <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de chambre</i> who happened
to be an accidental listener. "How numerous they must
have been!"</p>

<p>"Numerous!" exclaimed the guide, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mona mon diaoul</i>, if they
had only pulled together, they would have dragged me out of bed!"</p>

<p>Since the knight's excursion, Torry has been more frequently
visited. In executing the Ordnance survey, a party of Sappers and
Miners were encamped upon the island, and the engineer officer in
command amused many of his solitary hours by collecting traditionary
tales from the narration of an old man, who was far more intelligent
than the rest of the inhabitants. The two foregoing legends were
taken from the patriarch's lips, and they afford an additional proof of
that fondness which man, in his savage state, ever evinces for traditions
that are wonderful and wild.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH.</h3>

<p class="center f90">HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS
REPUTABLE FRIENDS.</p>

<p>About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates
had gone out to pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin
took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying
sin of ingratitude, of which he clearly demonstrated he had
been guilty to no ordinary extent in wilfully absenting himself
from the society of his anxious friends, and still more in endeavouring
to escape from them after so much trouble and expense
had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin laid great stress
on the fact of his having taken Oliver in and cherished him,
when without his timely aid he might have perished with hunger;
and related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad
whom in his philanthropy he had succoured under parallel
circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence,
and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately
come to be hung at the Old Bailey one morning.
Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe,
but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and
treacherous behaviour of the young person in question had rendered
it necessary that he should become the victim of certain
evidence for the crown, which, if it were not precisely true, was
indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin), and
a few select friends. Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather
disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging, and, with
great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious
hope that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist
to that unpleasant operation.</p>

<p>Little Oliver's blood ran cold as he listened to the Jew's
words, and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed
in them: that it was possible even for justice itself to confound
the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental
companionship, he knew already; and that deeply-laid plans for
the destruction of inconveniently-knowing, or over-communicative
persons, had been really devised and carried out by the old
Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely
when he recollected the general nature of the altercations
between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes, which seemed to
bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind. As he
glanced timidly up, and met the Jew's searching look, he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed
nor unrelished by the wary villain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 553px;">
<a id="OT5"></a><img src="images/i566.jpg" width="553" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Master Bates explains a Professional
Technicality</div>
</div>

<p>The Jew smiled hideously, and, patting Oliver on the head,
said that if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business,
he saw they would be very good friends yet. Then taking
his hat, and covering himself up in an old patched great-coat,
he went out and locked the room-door behind him.</p>

<p>And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part
of many subsequent days, seeing nobody between early morning
and midnight, and left during the long hours to commune with his
own thoughts; which, never failing to revert to his kind friends,
and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him, were
sad indeed. After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the
room-door unlocked, and he was at liberty to wander about the
house.</p>

<p>It was a very dirty place; but the rooms up stairs had great
high wooden mantel-pieces and large doors, with paneled walls
and cornices to the ceilings, which, although they were black
with neglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways; from
all of which tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago, before
the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and
had perhaps been quite gay and handsome, dismal and dreary
as it looked now.</p>

<p>Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and
ceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room,
the mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to
their holes: with these exceptions, there was neither sight nor
sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he
was tired of wandering from room to room, he would crouch in
the corner of the passage by the street-door, to be as near living
people as he could, and to remain there listening and trembling
until the Jew or the boys returned.</p>

<p>In all the rooms the mouldering shutters were fast closed,
and the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood;
the only light which was admitted making its way through
round holes at the top, which made the rooms more gloomy,
and filled them with strange shadows. There was a back-garret
window, with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter, and out
of which Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours
together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused
and crowded mass of house-tops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.
Sometimes, indeed, a ragged grizzly head might be
seen peering over the parapet-wall of a distant house, but it was
quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of Oliver's observatory
was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain and smoke of
years, it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of
the different objects beyond, without making any attempt to be
seen or heard,&mdash;which he had as much chance of being as if he
had been inside the ball of St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<p>One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged
out that evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into
his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his
person (which, to do him justice, was by no means an habitual
weakness with him;) and, with this end and aim, he condescendingly
commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet straightway.</p>

<p>Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful, too happy to
have some faces, however bad, to look upon, and too desirous to
conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so, to
throw any objection in the way of this proposal; so he at once
expressed his readiness, and, kneeling on the floor, while the
Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his
lap, he applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated
as "japanning his trotter-cases," and which phrase, rendered
into plain English, signifieth cleaning his boots.</p>

<p>Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which
a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table
in an easy attitude, smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly
to and fro, and having his boots cleaned all the time without
even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the prospective
misery of putting them on, to disturb his reflections;
or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the
feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified
his thoughts, he was evidently tinctured for the nonce with a
spice of romance and enthusiasm foreign to his general nature.
He looked down on Oliver with a thoughtful countenance for a
brief space, and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle
sigh, said, half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates,</p>

<p>"What a pity it is he isn't a prig!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Master Charles Bates. "He don't know what's
good for him."</p>

<p>The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe, as did
Charley Bates, and they both smoked for some seconds in
silence.</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't even know what a prig is?" said the
Dodger mournfully.</p>

<p>"I think I know that," replied Oliver, hastily looking up.
"It's a th&mdash;; you're one, are you not?" inquired Oliver,
checking himself.</p>

<p>"I am," replied the Dodger. "I'd scorn to be anythink
else." Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock after delivering
this sentiment, and looked at Master Bates as if to denote
that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary.
"I am," repeated the Dodger; "so's Charley; so's
Fagin; so's Sikes; so's Nancy; so's Bet; so we all are, down
to the dog, and he's the downiest one of the lot."</p>

<p>"And the least given to peaching," added Charley Bates.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
committing himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left
him there without wittles for a fortnight," said the Dodger.</p>

<p>"That he wouldn't; not a bit of it," observed Charley.</p>

<p>"He's a rum dog. Don't he look fierce at any strange cove
that laughs or sings when he's in company!" pursued the
Dodger. "Won't he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing,
and don't he hate other dogs as ain't of his breed! Winkin!
Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"He's an out-and-out Christian," said Charley.</p>

<p>This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal's abilities,
but it was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master
Bates had only known it; for there are a great many ladies
and gentlemen claiming to be out-and-out Christians, between
whom and Mr. Sikes's dog there exist very strong and singular
points of resemblance.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said the Dodger, recurring to the point from
which they had strayed, with that mindfulness of his profession
which influenced all his proceedings. "This hasn't got anything
to do with young Green here."</p>

<p>"No more it has," said Charley. "Why don't you put
yourself under Fagin, Oliver?"</p>

<p>"And make your fortun' out of hand?" added the Dodger,
with a grin.</p>

<p>"And so be able to retire on your property, and do the genteel,
as I mean to in the very next leap-year but four that
ever comes, and the forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,"
said Charley Bates.</p>

<p>"I don't like it," rejoined Oliver timidly; "I wish they
would let me go. I&mdash;I&mdash;would rather go."</p>

<p>"And Fagin would <em>rather</em> not!" rejoined Charley.</p>

<p>Oliver knew this too well; but, thinking it might be dangerous
to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and
went on with his boot-cleaning.</p>

<p>"Go!" exclaimed the Dodger. "Why, where's your spirit?
Don't you take any pride out of yourself? Would you go and
be dependent on your friends, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, blow that!" said Master Bates, drawing two or three
silk handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard,
"that's too mean, that is!"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> couldn't do it," said the Dodger, with an air of haughty
disgust.</p>

<p>"You can leave your friends, though," said Oliver, with a
half-smile, "and let them be punished for what you did."</p>

<p>"That," rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe,&mdash;"that
was all out of consideration for Fagin, 'cause the traps
know that we work together, and he might have got into trouble
if we hadn't made our lucky; that was the move, wasn't it,
Charley?"</p>

<p>Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
that the recollection of Oliver's flight came so suddenly upon
him, that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh,
and went up into his head, and down into his throat, and
brought on a fit of coughing and stamping about five minutes
long.</p>

<p>"Look here!" said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of
shillings and halfpence. "Here's a jolly life! what's the odds
where it comes from? Here, catch hold; there's plenty more
where they were took from. You won't, won't you? oh, you
precious flat!"</p>

<p>"It's naughty, ain't it, Oliver?" inquired Charley Bates.
"He'll come to be scragged, won't he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what that means," replied Oliver, looking
round.</p>

<p>"Something in this way, old feller," said Charley. As he
said it, Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief, and,
holding it erect in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder,
and jerked a curious sound through his teeth, thereby indicating,
by a lively pantomimic representation that scragging
and hanging were one and the same thing.</p>

<p>"That's what it means," said Charley. "Look how he
stares, Jack; I never did see such prime company as that 'ere
boy; he'll be the death of me, I know he will." And Master
Charles Bates having laughed heartily again, resumed his pipe
with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You've been brought up bad," said the Dodger, surveying
his boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished
them. "Fagin will make something of you, though; or you'll
be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable. You'd
better begin at once, for you'll come to the trade long before
you think of it, and you're only losing time, Oliver."</p>

<p>Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions
of his own, which being exhausted, he and his friend Mr.
Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous
pleasures incidental to the life they led, interspersed with a variety
of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do, would
be to secure Fagin's favour without more delay by the same
means which they had employed to gain it.</p>

<p>"And always put this in your pipe, Nolly," said the Dodger,
as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above, "if you don't
take fogles and tickers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the good of talking in that way?" interposed Master
Bates; "he don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"If you don't take pocket-hankechers and watches," said the
Dodger, reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver's capacity,
"some other cove will; so that the coves that lose 'em will
be all the worse, and you'll be all the worse too, and nobody
half a ha'p'orth the better, except the chaps wot gets them&mdash;and
you've just as good a right to them as they have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure,&mdash;to be sure!" said the Jew, who had entered
unseen by Oliver. "It all lies in a nutshell, my dear&mdash;in a
nutshell, take the Dodger's word for it. Ha! ha! he understands
the catechism of his trade."</p>

<p>The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together as he corroborated
the Dodger's reasoning in these terms, and chuckled
with delight at his pupil's proficiency.</p>

<p>The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the
Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman
whom Oliver had never seen before, but who was accosted
by the Dodger as Tom Chitling, and who, having lingered
on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady, now
made his appearance.</p>

<p>Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger, having perhaps
numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference
in his deportment towards that young gentleman which
seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority
in point of genius and professional acquirements. He
had small twinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a fur
cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an
apron. His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but
he excused himself to the company by stating that his "time"
was only out an hour before, and that, in consequence of having
worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able
to bestow any attention on his private clothes. Mr. Chitling
added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating
clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it
burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against the county;
the same remark he considered to apply to the regulation
mode of cutting the hair, which he held to be decidedly unlawful.
Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating that
he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two mortal
long hard-working days, and that he "wished he might be
busted if he wasn't as dry as a lime-basket!"</p>

<p>"Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?"
inquired the Jew with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of
spirits on the table.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous
look at Oliver.</p>

<p>"A young friend of mine, my dear," replied the Jew.</p>

<p>"He's in luck then," said the young man, with a meaning
look at Fagin. "Never mind where I came from, young 'un;
you'll find your way there soon enough, I'll bet a crown!"</p>

<p>At this sally the boys laughed, and, after some more jokes on
the same subject, exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin,
and withdrew.</p>

<p>After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin,
they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
Oliver to come and sit by him, led the conversation to the topics
most calculated to interest his hearers. These were, the
great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of the Dodger,
the amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew
himself. At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly
exhausted, and Mr. Chitling did the same (for the
house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two); accordingly
Miss Betsy withdrew, and left the party to their repose.</p>

<p>From this day Oliver was seldom left alone, but was placed
in almost constant communication with the two boys, who played
the old game with the Jew every day,&mdash;whether for their
own improvement, or Oliver's, Mr. Fagin best knew. At other
times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had
committed in his younger days, mixed up with so much that
was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing
heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his
better feelings.</p>

<p>In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils; and, having
prepared his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society
to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a
dreary place, was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison
which he hoped would blacken it and change its hue for ever.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER THE NINETEENTH.</h3>

<p class="center f90">IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON.</p>

<p>It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew, buttoning
his great-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the
collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower
part of his face, emerged from his den. He paused on the step
as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having
listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating
footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as
quickly as he could.</p>

<p>The house to which Oliver had been conveyed was in the
neighbourhood of Whitechapel; the Jew stopped for an instant
at the corner of the street, and, glancing suspiciously round,
crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of Spitalfields.</p>

<p>The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung
over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything
felt cold and clammy to the touch. It seemed just the night
when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad. As he
glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls
and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome
reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he
moved, crawling forth by night in search of some rich offal for
a meal.</p>

<p>He kept on his course through many winding and narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
ways until he reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly
off to the left, he soon became involved in a maze of the mean
dirty streets which abound in that close and densely-populated
quarter.</p>

<p>The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed,
however, to be at all bewildered either by the darkness
of the night or the intricacies of the way. He hurried through
several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one lighted
only by a single lamp at the farther end. At the door of a
house in this street he knocked, and, having exchanged a few
muttered words with the person who opened the door, walked
up stairs.</p>

<p>A dog growled as he touched the handle of a door, and a
man's voice demanded who was there.</p>

<p>"Only me, Bill; only me, my dear," said the Jew, looking
in.</p>

<p>"Bring in your body," said Sikes. "Lie down, you stupid
brute! Don't you know the devil when he's got a great-coat
on?"</p>

<p>Apparently the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr.
Fagin's outer garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and
threw it over the back of a chair, he retired to the corner from
which he had risen, wagging his tail as he went, to show that
he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Sikes.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," replied the Jew. "Ah! Nancy."</p>

<p>The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment
to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and
his young friend had not met since she had interfered in behalf
of Oliver. All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were,
however, speedily removed by the young lady's behaviour. She
took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade
Fagin draw up his without saying any more about it, for it
was a cold night, and no mistake. Miss Nancy prefixed to the
word "cold" another adjective, derived from the name of an
unpleasant instrument of death, which, as the word is seldom
mentioned to ears polite in any other form than as a substantive,
I have omitted in this chronicle.</p>

<p>"It is cold, Nancy dear," said the Jew, as he warmed his
skinny hands over the fire. "It seems to go right through
one," added the old man, touching his left side.</p>

<p>"It must be a piercer if it finds its way through your heart,"
said Mr. Sikes. "Give him something to drink, Nancy. Burn
my body, make haste! It's enough to turn a man ill to see his
lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just
rose from the grave."</p>

<p>Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard in which
there were many, which, to judge from the diversity of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids; and Sikes,
pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.</p>

<p>"Quite enough, quite, thankye Bill," replied the Jew, putting
down the glass after just setting his lips to it.</p>

<p>"What! you're afraid of our getting the better of you, are
you?" inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew; "ugh!"</p>

<p>With a hoarse grunt of contempt Mr. Sikes seized the glass
and emptied it, as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for
himself, which he did at once.</p>

<p>The Jew glanced round the room as his companion tossed
down the second glassful; not in curiosity, for he had seen it
often before, but in a restless and suspicious manner which
was habitual to him. It was a meanly furnished apartment,
with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief
that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no
more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three
heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a "life-preserver"
that hung over the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"There," said Sikes, smacking his lips. "Now I'm ready."</p>

<p>"For business&mdash;eh?" inquired the Jew.</p>

<p>"For business," replied Sikes; "so say what you've got to
say."</p>

<p>"About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?" said the Jew, drawing
his chair forward, and speaking in a very low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. What about it?" inquired Sikes.</p>

<p>"Ah! you know what I mean, my dear," said the Jew.
"He knows what I mean, Nancy; don't he?"</p>

<p>"No, he don't," sneered Mr. Sikes, "or he won't, and that's
the same thing. Speak out, and call things by their right
names; don't sit there winking and blinking, and talking to me
in hints, as if you warn't the very first that thought about the
robbery. D&mdash;&mdash; your eyes! wot d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Bill, hush!" said the Jew, who had in vain attempted
to stop this burst of indignation; "somebody will hear us, my
dear; somebody will hear us."</p>

<p>"Let 'em hear!" said Sikes; "I don't care." But as Mr.
Sikes <em>did</em> care, upon reflection, he dropped his voice as he said
the words, and grew calmer.</p>

<p>"There, there," said the Jew coaxingly. "It was only my
caution&mdash;nothing more. Now, my dear, about that crib at
Chertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh?&mdash;when is it to be
done? Such plate, my dears, such plate!" said the Jew, rubbing
his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Sikes coldly.</p>

<p>"Not to be done at all!" echoed the Jew, leaning back in his
chair.</p>

<p>"No, not at all," rejoined Sikes; "at least it can't be a put-up
job, as we expected."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it hasn't been properly gone about," said the Jew,
turning pale with anger. "Don't tell me!"</p>

<p>"But I will tell you," retorted Sikes. "Who are you that's
not to be told? I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging
about the place for a fortnight, and he can't get one of the
servants into a line."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me, Bill," said the Jew, softening as
the other grew heated, "that neither of the two men in the
house can be got over?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do mean to tell you so," replied Sikes. "The old
lady has had 'em these twenty year; and, if you were to give
'em five hundred pound, they wouldn't be in it."</p>

<p>"But do you mean to say, my dear," remonstrated the Jew,
"that the women can't be got over?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," replied Sikes.</p>

<p>"Not by flash Toby Crackit?" said the Jew incredulously.
"Think what women are, Bill."</p>

<p>"No; not even by flash Toby Crackit," replied Sikes. "He
says he's worn sham whiskers and a canary waistcoat the whole
blessed time he's been loitering down there, and it's all of no use."</p>

<p>"He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military
trousers, my dear," said the Jew after a few moments' reflection.</p>

<p>"So he did," rejoined Sikes, "and they warn't of no more
use than the other plant."</p>

<p>The Jew looked very blank at this information, and, after
ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast,
raised his head, and said with a deep sigh that, if flash Toby
Crackit reported aright, he feared the game was up.</p>

<p>"And yet," said the old man, dropping his hands on his
knees, "it's a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had
set our hearts upon it."</p>

<p>"So it is," said Mr. Sikes; "worse luck!"</p>

<p>A long silence ensued, during which the Jew was plunged in
deep thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villany
perfectly demoniacal. Sikes eyed him furtively from time
to time; and Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker,
sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had
been deaf to all that passed.</p>

<p>"Fagin," said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed,
"is it worth fifty shiners extra if it's safely done from
the outside?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Jew, suddenly rousing himself as if from a
trance.</p>

<p>"Is it a bargain?" inquired Sikes.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, yes," rejoined the Jew, grasping the other's
hand, his eyes glistening and every muscle in his face working
with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened.</p>

<p>"Then," said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew's hand with some
disdain, "let it come off as soon as you like. Toby and I were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
over the garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels
of the doors and shutters: the crib's barred up at night like a
jail, but there's one part we can crack, safe and softly."</p>

<p>"Which is that, Bill?" asked the Jew eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why," whispered Sikes, "as you cross the lawn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his
eyes almost starting out of it.</p>

<p>"Umph!" cried Sikes, stopping short as the girl, scarcely
moving her head, looked suddenly round and pointed for an
instant to the Jew's face. "Never mind which part it is. You
can't do it without me, I know; but it's best to be on the safe
side when one deals with you."</p>

<p>"As you like, my dear, as you like," replied the Jew, biting
his lip. "Is there no help wanted but yours and Toby's?"</p>

<p>"None," said Sikes, "'cept a centre-bit and a boy; the first
we've both got; the second you must find us."</p>

<p>"A boy!" exclaimed the Jew. "Oh! then it is a panel,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Never mind wot it is!" replied Sikes; "I want a boy, and
he mustn't be a big un. Lord!" said Mr. Sikes reflectively,
"if I'd only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper's!&mdash;he
kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the job.
But the father gets lagged, and then the Juvenile Delinquent
Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he
was arning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time
makes a 'prentice of him. And so they go on," said Mr. Sikes,
his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs,&mdash;"so they
go on; and, if they'd got money enough, (which it's a Providence
they have not,) we shouldn't have half-a-dozen boys left
in the whole trade in a year or two."</p>

<p>"No more we should," acquiesced the Jew, who had been
considering during this speech, and had only caught the last
sentence. "Bill!"</p>

<p>"What now?" inquired Sikes.</p>

<p>The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still
gazing at the fire; and intimated by a sign that he would have
her told to leave the room. Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently,
as if he thought the precaution unnecessary, but complied,
nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a
jug of beer.</p>

<p>"You don't want any beer," said Nancy, folding her arms,
and retaining her seat very composedly.</p>

<p>"I tell you I do!" replied Sikes.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" rejoined the girl, coolly. "Go on, Fagin. I
know what he's going to say, Bill; he needn't mind me."</p>

<p>The Jew still hesitated, and Sikes looked from one to the
other in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, you don't mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?" he
asked at length. "You've known her long enough to trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
her, or the devil's in it; she ain't one to blab, are you
Nancy?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> should think not!" replied the young lady, drawing her
chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear,&mdash;I know you're not," said the Jew;
"but&mdash;&mdash;" and again the old man paused.</p>

<p>"But wot?" inquired Sikes.</p>

<p>"I didn't know whether she mightn't p'raps be out of sorts,
you know, my dear, as she was the other night," replied the
Jew.</p>

<p>At this confession Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh, and,
swallowing a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of
defiance, and burst into sundry exclamations of "Keep the game
a-going!" "Never say die!" and the like, which seemed at once
to have the effect of re-assuring both gentlemen, for the Jew
nodded his head with a satisfied air, and resumed his seat, as
did Mr. Sikes likewise.</p>

<p>"Now, Fagin," said Miss Nancy with a laugh, "tell Bill
at once about Oliver!"</p>

<p>"Ah! you're a clever one, my dear; the sharpest girl I ever
saw!" said the Jew, patting her on the neck. "It <em>was</em> about
Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"What about him?" demanded Sikes.</p>

<p>"He's the boy for you, my dear," replied the Jew in a hoarse
whisper, laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning
frightfully.</p>

<p>"He!" exclaimed Sikes.</p>

<p>"Have him, Bill!" said Nancy. "I would if I was in
your place. He mayn't be so much up as any of the others;
but that's not what you want if he's only to open a door for
you. Depend upon it he's a safe one, Bill."</p>

<p>"I know he is," rejoined Fagin; "he's been in good training
these last few weeks, and it's time he began to work for his
bread; besides, the others are all too big."</p>

<p>"Well, he is just the size I want," said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.</p>

<p>"And will do everything you want, Bill my dear," interposed
the Jew; "he can't help himself,&mdash;that is, if you only
frighten him enough."</p>

<p>"Frighten him!" echoed Sikes. "It'll be no sham frightening,
mind you. If there's anything queer about him when we
once get into the work,&mdash;in for a penny, in for a pound,&mdash;you
won't see him alive again, Fagin. Think of that before you
send him. Mark my words!" said the robber, shaking a heavy
crowbar which he had drawn from under the bedstead.</p>

<p>"I've thought of it all," said the Jew with energy. "I've&mdash;I've
had my eye upon him, my dears, close; close. Once let
him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea
that he has been a thief, and he's ours,&mdash;ours for his life! Oho!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
It couldn't have come about better!" The old man crossed his
arms upon his breast, and, drawing his head and shoulders into
a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.</p>

<p>"Ours!" said Sikes. "Yours, you mean."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do, my dear," said the Jew with a shrill chuckle.
"Mine, if you like, Bill."</p>

<p>"And wot," said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable
friend,&mdash;"wot makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced
kid, when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about
Common Garden every night, as you might pick and choose
from?"</p>

<p>"Because they're of no use to me, my dear," replied the
Jew with some confusion, "not worth the taking; for their
looks convict 'em when they get into trouble, and I lose 'em all.
With this boy properly managed, my dears, I could do what
I couldn't with twenty of them. Besides," said the Jew, recovering
his self-possession, "he has us now if he could only
give us leg-bail again; and he <em>must</em> be in the same boat with
us; never mind how he came there, it's quite enough for my
power over him that he was in a robbery, that's all I want.
Now how much better this is, than being obliged to put the
poor leetle boy out of the way, which would be dangerous,&mdash;and
we should lose by it, besides."</p>

<p>"When is it to be done?" asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent
exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the
disgust with which he received Fagin's affectation of humanity.</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure," said the Jew, "when is it to be done,
Bill?"</p>

<p>"I planned with Toby the night arter to-morrow," rejoined
Sikes in a surly voice, "if he heard nothing from me to the
contrairy."</p>

<p>"Good," said the Jew; "there's no moon."</p>

<p>"No," rejoined Sikes.</p>

<p>"It's all arranged about bringing off the swag,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> is it?"
asked the Jew.</p>

<p>Sikes nodded.</p>

<p>"And about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh ah, it's all planned," rejoined Sikes, interrupting him;
"never mind particulars. You'd better bring the boy here
to-morrow night; I shall get off the stones an hour arter daybreak.
Then you hold your tongue, and keep the melting-pot
ready, and that's all you'll have to do."</p>

<p>After some discussion in which all three took an active part,
it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next
evening, when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with
her: Fagin craftily observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination
to the task, he would be more willing to accompany the
girl, who had so recently interfered in his behalf, than anybody
else. It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly
consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;
and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he
thought fit, and should not be held responsible by the Jew for
any mischance or evil that might befal the boy, or any punishment
with which it might be necessary to visit him, it being
understood that, to render the compact in this respect binding,
any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his return should
be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all important
particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit.</p>

<p>These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink
brandy at a furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an
alarming manner, yelling forth at the same time most unmusical
snatches of song mingled with wild execrations. At length, in
a fit of professional enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his
box of housebreaking tools, which he had no sooner stumbled
in with, and opened for the purpose of explaining the
nature and properties of the various implements it contained,
and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell over
it upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.</p>

<p>"Good night, Nancy!" said the Jew, muffling himself up as
before.</p>

<p>"Good night!"</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her narrowly. There
was no flinching about the girl. She was as true and earnest in
the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be.</p>

<p>The Jew again bade her good night, and, bestowing a sly
kick upon the prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was
turned, groped down stairs.</p>

<p>"Always the way," muttered the Jew to himself as he turned
homewards. "The worst of these women is, that a very little
thing serves to call up some long-forgotten feeling; and the
best of them is, that it never lasts. Ha! ha! The man against
the child, for a bag of gold!"</p>

<p>Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin
wended his way through mud and mire to his gloomy abode,
where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.</p>

<p>"Is Oliver a-bed? I want to speak to him," was his first remark
as they descended the stairs.</p>

<p>"Hours ago," replied the Dodger, throwing open a door.
"Here he is!"</p>

<p>The boy was lying fast asleep on a rude bed upon the floor,
so pale with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his
prison, that he looked like death; not death as it shows in
shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears when life has just
departed: when a young and gentle spirit has but an instant
fled to heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time
to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.</p>

<p>"Not now," said the Jew turning softly away. "To-morrow.
To-morrow."</p>

<p>The ladies of Shakspeare have of course riveted the attention, and
drawn to them the sympathies, of all who have read or seen his plays.
The book-trained critic, weighing words and sentences in his closet;
the romantic poet, weaving his verses by grove or stream; the polished
occupant of the private box; the unwashed brawler of the gallery;
the sedate visitant of the pit, are touched each in his several
way by the conjugal devotion and melancholy fate of Desdemona, the
high-souled principle of Isabella, the enthusiastic love and tragic end
of Juliet, the maternal agonies of Constance, the stern energies of
Margaret of Anjou, the lofty resignation of Katharine, the wit and romance
of Rosalind, frolic of tongue, but deeply feeling at heart; the
accomplished coquetries of Cleopatra, redeemed and almost sanctified
by her obedient rushing to welcome death at the call ringing in her
ears from the grave of her self-slain husband; the untiring affection
of Imogen, Ophelia's stricken heart and maddened brain, or the filial
constancy of Cordelia. Less deeply marked, but all in their kind beautiful,
are the innocence of Miranda, the sweetness of Anne Page, the
meek bearing&mdash;beneath the obtrusion of undesired honours&mdash;of Anne
Boleyn, the playful fondness of Jessica;&mdash;but I should run through
all the catalogue of Shakspeare's plays were I to continue the enumeration.
The task is unnecessary, for they dwell in the hearts of all,
of every age, and sex, and condition. They nestle in the bosoms of the
wise and the simple, the sedentary and the active, the moody and the
merry, the learned and the illiterate, the wit of the club, the rustic of
the farm, the soldier in camp, the scholar in college; and it affords a
remarkable criterion of their general effect, that, even in those foreign
countries which, either from imperfect knowledge, defective taste, or
national prejudice, set little value on the plays of Shakspeare,&mdash;while
Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, King John, Lear, and Falstaff, are unknown
or rejected, the names of Desdemona and Juliet are familiar
as household words.</p>

<p>No writer ever created so many female characters, or placed them
in situations of such extreme diversity; and in none do we find so
lofty an appreciation of female excellence. The stories from which
the great dramatists of Athens drew their plots were, in most of their
striking incidents, derogatory to woman. The tale of Troy divine,
the war of Thebes, the heroic legends, were their favourite, almost
their exclusive sources; and the crimes, passions, and misfortunes
of Clytemnestra and Medea, Phædra and Jocasta, could only darken
the scene. An adulterous spouse aiding in the murder of her long-absent
lord, the King of men, returning crowned with conquest; a
daughter participating in the ruthless avenging by death inflicted on
a mother by a son; an unpitying sorceress killing her children to satiate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
rage against her husband; a faithless wife endeavouring to force
her shameless love on her step-son, and by false accusation consigning
him for his refusal to destruction beneath his father's curse; a melancholy
queen linked in incestuous nuptials to her own offspring;&mdash;these
ladies are the heroines of the most renowned of the Greek tragedies!
and the consequences of their guilt or misfortune compose
the fable of many more. In some of the Greek plays, as the Eumenides,
we have no female characters except the unearthly habitants
of heaven or hell; in the most wondrous of them all, Prometheus
Fettered, appears only the mythic Io; in the Persians, only the ghost
of Atossa, who scarcely appertains to womankind: in some, as Philoctetes,
women form no part of the <em>dramatis personæ</em>; in others, as
the Seven against Thebes, they are of no importance to the action of
the piece; or, as in the Suppliants, serve but as the Chorus; and, in
many more, are of less than secondary importance. Euripides often
makes them the objects of those ungallant reflections which consign
the misogynic dramatist to such summary punishment from the irritated
sex in the comedies of Aristophanes; and in the whole number,
in the thirty-three plays extant, there are but two women who can
affect our nobler or softer emotions. The tender and unremitting
care of Antigone for her blind, forlorn, and aged father, her unbending
determination to sacrifice her lover and her life sooner than
fail in paying funeral honours to her fallen brother; and, in Alcestis,
her resolute urging that her own life should be taken to preserve that
of a beloved husband,&mdash;invest them with a pathetic and heroic beauty.
But, in the one, we are haunted by the horrid recollections of incest
and fratricide; and, in the other, we are somewhat indignant that we
should be forced to sympathize with an affection squandered upon so
heartless a fellow as Admetus, who suffers his wife to perish in his
stead with the most undisturbed conviction of the superior value of
his own existence, pouring forth all the while the most melodious
lamentations over her death, but never for a moment thinking of
coming forward to prevent it. They are beautiful creations, nevertheless.</p>

<p>The Greek dramatists were in a great measure bound to a particular
class of subjects; but, in general, the manner in which an author
treats the female character, affords one of the main criteria by which
the various gradations of genius may be estimated. By the highest
genius woman is always spoken of with a deep feeling of the most reverential
delicacy. Helen is the cause of the war immortalized by
the Iliad; but no allusion to her lapse is made throughout the poem
save by herself, deploring in bitter accents what she has done. She
wishes that she had died an evil death before she followed Paris; she
acknowledges herself to be unworthy of the kindred of those whom
she describes as deserving of honour; her conscience suggests that
her far-famed brothers, "whom one mother bore," are in the field
when the warring chieftains meet in truce, but dare not show themselves
among their peers through shame of the disgrace she has entailed
upon them; and, at the last, she lays bare her internal feeling
that insult is the lot she deserves by the warm gratitude with which
she acknowledges, in her bitter lament over the corpse of Hector, that
he had the generosity never to address her with upbraiding. The
wrath of Achilles is roused for the injury inflicted upon him by carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
off Briseis, dear to his heart, "spear-captured as she was." She
is restored by the penitent Agamemnon, with solemn vows that she
returns pure and uninsulted. Of Andromache I think it unnecessary
to speak. In the Odyssey, it is true, we have Circe and Calypso; but
they are goddesses couching with a mortal, and excite no human
passion. We meet them in the region of "<em>speciosa miracula</em>," where
Cyclops, and Sirius, and Lotus-eaters dwell; where the King of the
winds holds his court, and whence is the passage to Erebus. In that
glorious mixture of adventure and allegory,&mdash;the Voyage of Ulysses,&mdash;we
may take those island beauties to be the wives and sweethearts
whom sailors meet in every port; or, following the stream of moralists
and commentators, look upon the fable to be no more than</p>

<p class="linequot">"Truth severe in fairy fiction dressed."
</p>

<p>In other parts of the poem we might wish for more warm-heartedness
in Penelope; but under her circumstances caution is excusable, and
she must be admitted to be a pattern of constancy and devotion.
The Helen of the Odyssey is a fine continuation of the Helen of
the Iliad. Still full of kindly feminine impulses, still sorrowing when
she thinks of the misfortunes she has occasioned, her griefs have
lost the intense poignancy with which they afflicted her while leading
a life degrading her in her own eyes, and exposing her to affronts of
which she could not complain. Restored to the husband of her early
affections, consoled by his pardon, and dwelling once more amid the
scenes of her youth,&mdash;absence from which, and absence so occasioned,
she had never ceased to regret in wasting floods of tears,&mdash;the Helen
of the Odyssey comes before us no longer uttering the accents of ceaseless
self-reproach, but soothed, if not pacified, in soul. We have the
<em>lull</em> after the tempest,&mdash;the calm following the whirlwind.</p>

<p>Virgil is a great poet indeed, though few will now agree with Scaliger
that he is equal, far less superior, to Homer. Dido is the blot
upon the Æneid. The loves of the Carthaginian queen might have
made, and in the hands of Virgil would have made, a charming
poem, treated separately,&mdash;a poem far superior in execution to the
Hero and Leander of Musæus, but a work of the same order. As it
stands, the episode, if it can be so called, utterly ruins the epic
character of the hero. St. Evremond has said that Æneas had all
the qualities of a monk; it is plain that he had not the feelings of a
gentleman; and we cannot wonder that his first wife wandered from
his side, and that he met with so violent an opposition when he sought
another. Virgil, after his conduct to Dido, had not the courage to
introduce him to Lavinia in person, and leaves him undefended to the
angry tongue of her mother. The poet was justly punished for
his fourth book; for, in all those which follow, he has not ventured
to introduce any female characters but incendiaries, sibyls, shrews,
and furies.</p>

<p>When Dante took Virgil as his guide in the infernal regions, he did
not follow his master in dwelling on the pleasures or the gentler
sorrows of illicit love. His ghostly women appear stern, or subdued
of port. The lady who is best known to the English reader, Francesca
di Rimini, forms no exception. Nothing can be more grave and
solemn than the tale of her hapless passion, as told in the Inferno. It
is pervaded throughout by such sorrow and remorse as we might expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
to find in a region whence hope is excluded. Accordingly, how
far different is its impression from that left on the mind by the same
story when told merely as a love-tale by Mr. Leigh Hunt. I do not
say this in disparagement of that picturesque and graphic poem, the
Story of Rimini, which has been exposed to the most unjustifiable
criticism; but to mark the manner in which men of talent and men of
genius handle the same subject. The ladies of Tasso, though not vigorously
sketched, and in general imitated from the Latin poets,&mdash;I
speak of his Jerusalem,&mdash;are conceived in a spirit of romantic chivalry;
and, even when the witching Armida leads Rinaldo astray, the
poet diverts our attention from the blandishments of the enchantress
to dazzle us by the wonders of magic groves and gardens. Poor
Tasso, besides, wishes to persuade us&mdash;perhaps in some moody hours
he had persuaded himself&mdash;that he intended the whole poem for an
allegory, in which Armida was to play some edifying part,&mdash;I forget
what. In the poets of romance we do not look for the severer style
of the epic; but the forest-ranging heroines of Ariosto and Spenser,
"roaming the woodland, frank and free," have an air of self-confiding
independence and maiden freshness, worthy of the leafy scenes
through which they move, that renders it impossible to approach
them with other thoughts than those of chivalrous deference. If
Spenser, in his canto of Jealousy, makes the lady of the victim of that
weak passion treat her husband as he had anticipated, why, she errs
with no man of mortal mould, but chooses as her mates the jolly
satyrs wonning in the wood; and Spenser has his allegory too. Ariosto
took no trouble to make explanations, being satisfied, I suppose,
with the character given of his poetry by Cardinal Hippolyto; and
even he has the grace to beg the ladies, to whose service he had from
the beginning dedicated his lays, to avert their eyes when he is about
to sing the strange adventures of Giocondo.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span></p>
<p>The theme of Milton in Paradise Lost, hardly admits of the developement
of ordinary human feelings; but his sole Eve has grace in
all her steps, and all her actions too. In Paradise Regained his subject
was badly chosen; and he feared, from religious motives, to introduce
the Virgin. In Comus his Lady is a model of icy chastity,
worthy of the classic verse in which she is embalmed; but Dalilah in
Samson Agonistes is the more dramatic conception. Ornate and gay,
she makes urgent court to her angry husband, with no better fate
than to be by him inexorably repelled. She presses upon him all the
topics that could lead to reconciliation, but the sense of his wrongs
is too acute to allow of pardon; and at last she bursts away with the
consoling reflection that, though spurned by him, and made the object
of reproach in Israelitish songs, she shall be hymned and honoured
in those of her own country as a deliverer. Milton was unhappy
in his wives and daughters; and his domestic manners appear to have
been harsh and unamiable. In his prose works, his Tetrachordon
for example, he does not display any kindly feeling for the sex; but
when he clothed himself in his singing robes, and soared above the
cares of every-day life, to expatiate in the purer regions of poetry,
the soul of the poet softened and sublimed; like his own Adam, his
sterner nature relented; and, though he could not make Samson pardon
Dalilah, he will not let her depart unhonoured. In Paradise
Lost he had spoken of her, disparagingly,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"So rose the Danite strong,</div>
<div class="verse">Herculean Samson, from the harlot lap</div>
<div class="verse">Of Philistæan Dalilah;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but when she comes before him, as it were, in bodily presence, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
leaves all the words of reproach to her irritated lord, and suggests to
her, topics of self-justification, dismissing her from the stage, not as a
faithless wife, but as a heroic woman, who had sacrificed her affections
to her country, and who retires after humiliating herself in vain
to reap the reward of her patriotic conduct among her people and
her kindred.</p>

<p>If we turn from the epic and tragic to the other departments of
literature in which genius can be exercised, we shall find the feeling
much the same. Those who write from observation of what is going
on in the world,&mdash;the novelist, the comic writer, the satirist,&mdash;must take
the world as it is, and lay it before us in its mixture of good and evil.
There is no need, however, that the latter should be forcibly thrust
upon us. The task of the satirists appears to me the lowest in which
talent can be employed. The most famous among them, Juvenal, tells
us truly that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rigidi censura cachinni</i>&mdash;the part chosen by Democritus&mdash;is
easy to any one. We must rise above it, as he has done in
some of his satires,&mdash;as in that sublime poem in which the passage
occurs, the tenth, or the thirteenth and fourteenth,&mdash;and forget the
wit or the censor to assume the loftier bearing of the moralist. I
should have wondered that the same mind which produced these noble
effusions could have perpetrated the enormities of the sixth satire
and some others, if I did not reflect that Rome, originally an asylum
for robbers, was nothing more than a standing camp, with the virtues
and vices, the manners and the feelings of a camp, to the day of its
downfall. Rape and violence procured its first women, and it would
seem as if the original act had influenced their feelings to the sex
throughout. It is certain that theirs is the only literature in the
world in which no female character is delineated worthy of the slightest
recollection,&mdash;a striking circumstance, and well deserving critical
investigation; but it would now lead us too far from our subject,
from which indeed I have delayed too long already. We must get
back to Shakspeare, staying only to remark that if Boccacio and his
imitator, Chaucer, have intermingled licentious tales in their miscellaneous
collection, they have done so, only in compliance with the
supposed necessity of delineating every species of life, and that they
hasten to show that they could be of finer spirit when emancipated
from the thraldom of custom; that Cervantes chequers the comic of
Don Quixote with visions of graceful and romantic beauty; and that
such will be found to be the case more or less in every composition
that takes firm hold of the human mind. I except, of course, works
of morals, science, and philosophy; and under those heads must
come the unromantic and unpoetic books of wit, and even buffoonery,
if they be doomed to last. Rabelais will live for ever to speak vocally
to the intelligent; but mere licentiousness must perish. Indulgence
in woman-scorning ribaldry inflicts due punishment upon
talent itself, if it be prostituted to such miserable work. The melancholy
ability which has been so successful in La Pucelle affords
a sufficient reason why its author failed when he attempted a Henriade.</p>

<p>Supereminent over all the great geniuses of the world,&mdash;and with
no others have I compared him,&mdash;is Shakspeare in his women. Homer
was not called upon to introduce them in such number or variety,
nor could they enter so intimately into the action of his poems.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
Still less was there opportunity for their delineation in Milton. But
Shakspeare's is the unique merit that, being a dramatist wielding
equally the highest tragic and the lowest comic, and therefore compelled
to bring females prominently forward in every variety of circumstance,
he has carefully avoided themes and situations which
might either inspire horror or disgust, or excite licentious feeling.
We have in him no Phædra, Clytemnestra, or Medea; no story like
those of Jocasta, or Monimia, or the Mysterious Mother. He would
have recoiled from what is hinted at in Manfred. Even the Myrrhs
of Sardanapalus could not have found a place among his heroines. In
none of his plots, comic or tragic, does female frailty form an ingredient.
The only play in which ladies have been betrayed is Measure
for Measure; and there he takes care that their misfortune shall be
amended, by marrying Mariana to Angelo, and ordering Claudio to
restore honour to Julietta, whom he had wronged. Nowhere else
does a similar example occur, and there it is set in strong contrast
with the high-toned purity of Isabella. In the instances of slandered
women, it seems to delight him to place them triumphant over their
slanderers; as Hero in Much Ado about Nothing, Hermione in the
Winter's Tale, Imogen in Cymbeline. All his heroes woo with the
most honourable views; there is no intrigue in any of his plays, no
falsehood to the married bed. Those who offer illicit proposals are
exposed to ruin and disgrace. Angelo falls from his lofty station.
Prince John is driven from his brother's court. Falstaff, the wit and
courtier, becomes a butt, when his evil star leads him to make lawless
courtship to the Wives of Windsor. The innocent and natural
love of Miranda in the Tempest affords a striking contrast to
the coarse and disgusting passion of Dorinda: a character thrust
into the play as an improvement by no less a man than Dryden.
Here again we may remark how great is the distance which separates
genius of the first order even from that which comes nearest
to it. The two most detestable women ever drawn by Shakspeare&mdash;Regan
and Goneril&mdash;are both in love with Edmund; but we
have no notice of their passion until the moment of their death,
and then we find that, wicked as were the thoughts which rankled
in their bosoms, no infringement of the laws of chastity was contemplated;
marriage was their intention: "I was contracted to them
both," says Edmund; "all three now marry in an instant." With his
dying breath he bears testimony that in the midst of their crimes
they were actuated by the dominant feeling of woman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"Yet Edmund was beloved;</div>
<div class="verse">The one the other poisoned for his sake,</div>
<div class="verse">And after slew herself."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Emilia is accused by Iago in soliloquy as being suspected of faithlessness
to his bed, but he obviously does not believe the charge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"I hate the Moor;</div>
<div class="verse">And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets</div>
<div class="verse">He has done my office; <em>I know not if 't be true</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,</div>
<div class="verse">Will do as if for surety."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He uses it merely as an additional excuse for hating the Moor; a
palliation to his conscience in the career which he is about to pursue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
Queen Gertrude's marriage with her brother-in-law is made
the subject of severe animadversion; but it does not appear that she
had dishonoured herself in the life of her first husband, or was in
any manner participant in the crime of Claudius. Hamlet, in the
vehemence of his anger, never insinuates such a charge; and the
Ghost, rising to moderate his violence, acquits her by his very appearance
at such a time, of any heinous degree of guilt. As for the
gross theory of Tieck respecting Ophelia, it is almost a national insult.
He maintains that she had yielded to Hamlet's passion, and
that its natural consequences had driven her to suicide. Such a
theory is in direct opposition to the retiring and obedient purity of
her character, the tenour of her conversations and soliloquies, the general
management of the play, and what I have endeavoured to show
is the undeviating current of Shakspeare's ideas. If the German
critic propounded this heresy to insult English readers through one
of their greatest favourites in revenge for the ungallant reason which
the Archbishop of Canterbury,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> in Henry V, assigns as the origin
of the Salique law, he might be pardoned; but, as it is plainly dictated
by a spirit of critical wickedness and blasphemy, I should consign
him, in spite of his learning, acuteness, and Shakspearian knowledge,
without compassion, to the avenging hands of Lysistrata.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Such, in the plays where he had to create the characters, was the
course of Shakspeare. In the historical plays, where he had to write
by the book, it is not at all different. Scandal is carefully avoided.
Many spots lie on the fame of Queen Elinor, but no reference is made
to them by the hostile tongue which describes the mother-queen as
a second Até, stirring her son, King John, to blood and strife. Jane
Shore, of whom Rowe, a commentator on Shakspeare too, made a
heroine, is not introduced on the stage in Richard III. Poor Joan
of Arc is used brutally, it must be owned; but it is not till she
is driven to the stake that she confesses to an infirmity which not
even her barbarous judges can seriously believe. We must observe,
besides, that the first part of Henry VI. can scarcely be considered
a play of Shakspeare, for he did little more than revise the old play
of that name. To the charge of the older dramatist, too, must be set
the strange exhibition of Margaret of Anjou mourning over the head
of the Duke of Suffolk in the second part. When Shakspeare has
that vigorous woman to himself, as in Richard III, she shows no
traces of such weakness; she is the heroic asserter of her husband's
rights, the unsubdued but not-to-be-comforted mourner over her
foully slaughtered son. He makes the scenes of the civil wars sad
enough; the father kills the son, the son the father, under the eyes
of the pitying king; but there is no hint of outrage on women. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
contrives to interest us equally in Katharine of Aragon and Anne
Boleyn. Everything that poetry can do, is done, to make us forget
the faults of Cleopatra, and to incline us to think that a world was
well lost for that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit nez retroussé</i>. We should in vain search the
writings of the Romans themselves for such Roman ladies as those of
Coriolanus and Julius Cæsar. In his camps and armies we have
much military tumult and railing, but nowhere the introduction of
licentious scenes. If Alcibiades be attended by his Phrynia and Timandra,
and Falstaff have his poll clawed like a parrot by Doll Tearsheet,
the Athenian ladies are introduced as a vehicle for the fierce
misanthropy of Timon, and the fair one of Eastcheap acts as a satire
upon the impotent desires of the withered elder, the dead elm, whom
she clasps in her venal embraces. They are drawn in their true
colours: no attempt is made to bedeck them with sentimental graces&mdash;to
hold them up to sympathetic admiration with the maudlin novelist,
or to exhibit them as "interesting young females" with the
police reporter. They lift not their brazen fronts in courts and palaces;
in obscure corners they ply their obscene trade. We know
that it is their vocation, and dismiss them from our minds. There is
no corruption to be feared from the example of the inmates of Mr.
Overdone's establishment or Mrs. Quickly's tavern. Shakspeare exhibits
only one fallen lady in all his plays,&mdash;and she is Cressida. But
Troilus and Cressida deserves a separate paper, if for no other reason,
yet because it is a play in which Shakspeare has handled the same
characters as Homer. It is worth while to consider in what points
these greatest of poets agree, and in what they differ.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the female character as drawn in Shakspeare. It is
pure, honourable, spotless,&mdash;ever ready to perform a kind action,&mdash;never
shrinking from a heroic one. Gentle and submissive where
duty or affection bids,&mdash;firm and undaunted in resisting the approaches
of sin, or shame, or disgrace. Constant in love through
every trial,&mdash;faithful and fond in all the great relations of life, as wife,
as daughter, as sister, as mother, as friend,&mdash;witty or refined, tender
or romantic, lofty or gay,&mdash;her failings shrouded, her good and lovely
qualities brought into the brightest light, she appears in the pages of
the mighty dramatist as if she were the cherished daughter of a fond
father, the idolized mistress of an adoring lover, the very goddess of
a kneeling worshipper. I have catalogued most of the female names
which adorn the plays. One is absent from the list. She is absent;
the dark lady of that stupendous work which, since the Eumenides,
bursting upon the stage with appalling howl in quest of the fugitive
Orestes, electrified with terror the Athenian audience, has met no
equal. I intend to maintain that Lady Macbeth, too, is human in
heart and impulse,&mdash;that she is not meant to be an embodiment of
the Furies.</p>

<p>Macbeth is the gloomiest of the plays. Well may its hero say that
he has supped full of horrors. It opens with the incantations of
spiteful witches, and concludes with a series of savage combats, stimulated
by quenchless hate on one side, and by the desperation inspired
by the consciousness of unpardonable crime on the other. In
every act we have blood in torrents. The first man who appears on
the stage is the <em>bleeding</em> captain. The first word uttered by earthly
lips is, "What <em>bloody</em> man is that?" The tale which the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
relates is full of fearful gashes, reeking wounds, and <em>bloody</em> execution.
The murder of Duncan in the second act stains the hands of Macbeth
so deeply as to render them fit to incarnadine the multitudinous seas,
and make the green&mdash;one red. His lady imbrues herself in the crimson
stream, and gilds the faces of the sleeping grooms with gore. She
thus affords a pretence to the thane for slaughtering them in an
access of simulated fury.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Their hands and faces were all badged with <em>blood</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">So were their daggers, which unwiped we found</div>
<div class="verse">Upon their pillows."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Macbeth carefully impresses the sanguinary scene upon his hearers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"Here lay Duncan,</div>
<div class="verse">His silver skin laced with his golden <em>blood</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature</div>
<div class="verse">For ruin's wasteful entrance; there the murderers,</div>
<div class="verse">Steeped in the colours of their trade, their daggers</div>
<div class="verse">Unmannerly breeched in <em>gore</em>."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Direful thoughts immediately follow, and the sky itself participates in
the horror. The old man who can well remember threescore and
ten, during which time he had witnessed dreadful hours and strange
things, considers all as mere trifles, compared with the sore night of
Duncan's murder.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"The heavens,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou seest, as troubled with man's act,</div>
<div class="verse">Threaten his <em>bloody</em> stage; by the clock 'tis day,</div>
<div class="verse">And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The horses of Duncan forget their careful training, and their natural
instincts, to break their stalls and eat each other. Gloom, ruin, murder,
horrible doubts, unnatural suspicions, portents of dread in earth and
heaven, surround us on all sides. In the third act, desperate assassins,
incensed by the blows and buffets of the world, weary with disasters,
tugged with fortune, willing to wreak their hatred on all mankind,
and persuaded that Banquo has been their enemy, set upon and
slay him, without remorse and without a word. The prayer of their
master to Night, that she would, with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"<em>Bloody</em> and invisible hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>which kept him in perpetual terror, is in part accomplished; and he
who was his enemy in, as he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"Such <em>bloody</em> distance,</div>
<div class="verse">That every minute of his being thrusts</div>
<div class="verse">Against my life,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>lies breathless in the dust. The murderers bring the witness of their
deed to the very banquet-chamber of the expecting king. They come
with <em>blood</em> upon the face. The hardened stabber does not communicate
the tidings of his exploit in set phrase. He minces not the matter,&mdash;his
language is not culled from any trim and weeded vocabulary;
and the king compliments him in return, in language equally
vernacular and unrefined.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"<span class="speaker">Mur.</span> My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Cheered by this flattering tribute to his merits, the accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
artist goes on, in all the pride of his profession, to show that he had
left no rubs or botches in his work. Macbeth, after a burst of indignation
at the escape of Fleance, recurs to the comfortable assurance
of Banquo's death, and asks, in the full certainty of an answer in the
affirmative,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi8">"But Banquo's safe?</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="speaker">Mur.</span> Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,</div>

<div class="verse vi2">The least a death to nature.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="speaker">Mac.</span> Thanks for that."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Presently the gory locks of Banquo's spectre attest the truth of what
the murderer has told, and the banquet breaks up by the flight, rather
than the retirement, of the astonished guests; leaving Macbeth dismally,
but fiercely, pondering over thoughts steeped in slaughter.
The very language of the scene is redolent of blood. The word itself
occurs in almost every speech. At the conclusion of the act, come
the outspeaking of suspicions hitherto only muttered, and the determination
of the Scottish nobles to make an effort which may give to
their tables meat, sleep to their eyes, and free their feasts and banquets
from those bloody knives, the fatal hue of which haunted them
in their very hours of retirement, relaxation, or festival.</p>

<p>The sanguine stain dyes the fourth act as deeply. A head severed
from the body, and a bloody child, are the first apparitions that rise
before the king at the bidding of the weird sisters. The blood-boltered
Banquo is the last to linger upon the stage, and sear the eyes
of the amazed tyrant. The sword of the assassin is soon at work in
the castle of Macduff; and his wife and children fly from the deadly
blow, shrieking "murder"&mdash;in vain. And the fifth act,&mdash;from its appalling
commencement, when the sleeping lady plies her hopeless
task of nightly washing the blood-stained hand, through the continual
clangour of trumpets calling, as clamorous harbingers, to blood and
death, to its conclusion, when Macduff, with dripping sword, brings
in the freshly hewn-off head of the "dead butcher," to lay it at the
feet of the victorious Malcolm,&mdash;exhibits a sequence of scenes in
which deeds and thoughts of horror and violence are perpetually, and
almost physically, forced upon the attention of the spectator. In
short, the play is one clot of blood from beginning to end. It was
objected to Alfieri, (by Grimm, I believe,) that he wrote his tragedies
not in tears, but blood. Shakspeare could write in tears when he
pleased. In Macbeth he chose to dip his pen in a darker current.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the course of the play does he seek to beguile us of
our tears. We feel no more interest in the gracious Duncan, in
Banquo, in Lady Macduff, than we do in the slaughtered grooms.
We feel that they have been brutally murdered; and, if similar occurrences
were to take place in Wapping or Rotherhithe, London would
be in commotion. All the police from A to Z would be set on the
alert, the newspapers crammed with paragraphs, and a hot search instigated
after the murderer. If taken, he would be duly tried, wondered
at, gazed after, convicted, hanged, and forgotten. We should think
no more of his victim than we now think of Hannah Browne. The
other characters of the play, with the exception of the two principal,
are nonentities. We care nothing for Malcolm or Donalbain, or
Lenox or Rosse, or the rest of the Scottish nobles. Pathetic, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
are the words which burst from Macduff when he hears the
astounding tidings that all his pretty chickens and their dam have
been carried off at one fell swoop; but he soon shakes the woman out
of his eyes, and dreams only of revenge. His companions are slightly
affected by the bloody deed, and grief is in a moment converted into
rage. It is but a short passage of sorrow, and the only one of the
kind. What is equally remarkable is, that we have but one slight
piece of comic in the play,&mdash;the few sentences given to the porter;<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and their humour turns upon a gloomy subject for jest,&mdash;the occupation
of the keeper of the gates of hell. With these two exceptions,&mdash;the
brief pathos of Macduff, and the equally brief comedy of the
porter,&mdash;all the rest is blood. Tears and laughter have no place in
this cavern of death.</p>

<p>Of such a gory poem, Macbeth is the centre, the moving spirit.
From the beginning, before treason has entered his mind, he appears
as a man delighting in blood. The captain, announcing his deeds
against Macdonwald, introduces him bedabbled in slaughter.</p>

<p>After this desperate backstroke, as Warburton justly calls it,<a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Macbeth
engages in another combat equally sanguinary. He and Banquo</p>

<div class="verse">I cannot tell."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hot from such scenes, he is met by the witches. They promise him
the kingdom of Scotland. The glittering prize instantly affects his
imagination; he is so wrapt in thought at the very moment of its
announcement that he cannot speak. He soon informs us what is the
hue of the visions passing through his mind. The witches had told
him he was to be king: they had not said a word about the means.
He instantly supplies them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Why do I yield to that suggestion</div>
<div class="verse">Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,</div>
<div class="verse">And make my seated heart knock at my ribs</div>
<div class="verse">Against the use of nature."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The dreaded word itself soon comes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"My thought, whose <span class="smcap">murder</span> yet is but fantastical,</div>
<div class="verse">Shakes so my single state of man, that function</div>
<div class="verse">Is smothered in surmise."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To a mind so disposed, temptation is unnecessary. The thing was
done. Duncan was marked out for murder before the letter was
written to Lady Macbeth, and she only followed the thought of her
husband.</p>

<p>Love for him is in fact her guiding passion. She sees that he
covets the throne,&mdash;that his happiness is wrapt up in the hope of
being a king,&mdash;and her part is accordingly taken without hesitation.
With the blindness of affection, she persuades herself that he is full
of the milk of human kindness, and that he would reject false and
unholy ways of attaining the object of his desire. She deems it,
therefore, her duty to spirit him to the task. Fate and metaphysical
aid, she argues, have destined him for the golden round of Scotland.
Shall she not lend her assistance? She does not ask the question
twice. She will. Her sex, her woman's breasts, her very nature,
oppose the task she has prescribed to herself; but she prays to the
ministers of murder, to the spirits that tend on mortal thoughts, to
make thick her blood, and stop up the access and passage of remorse;
and she succeeds in mustering the desperate courage which bears
her through. Her instigation was not in reality wanted. Not merely
the murder of Duncan, but of Malcolm, was already resolved on by
Macbeth.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step</div>
<div class="verse">On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,</div>
<div class="verse">For in my way it lies. Stars! hide your fires,</div>
<div class="verse">Let not light see my black and dark desires!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As the time for the performance of the deed approaches, he is harassed
by doubts; but he scarcely shows any traces of compunction
or remorse. He pauses before the crime,&mdash;not from any hesitation
at its enormity, but for fear of its results,&mdash;for fear of the poisoned
chalice being returned to his own lips,&mdash;for fear of the trumpet-tongued
indignation which must attend the discovery of the murder
of so popular a prince as Duncan,&mdash;one who has borne his faculties so
meekly, and loaded Macbeth himself with honours. He is not
haunted by any feeling for the sin, any compassion for his victim;&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
dread of losing the golden opinions he has so lately won, the consequences
of failure, alone torment him. His wife has not to suggest
murder, for that has been already resolved upon; but to represent the
weakness of drawing back, after a resolution has once been formed.
She well knows that the momentary qualm will pass off,&mdash;that Duncan
is to be slain, perhaps when time and place will not so well adhere.
Now, she argues,&mdash;now it can be done with safety. Macbeth
is determined to wade through slaughter to a throne. If he passes
this moment, he loses the eagerly desired prize, and lives for ever
after, a coward in his own esteem; or he may make the attempt at a
moment when detection is so near at hand, that the stroke which
sends Duncan to his fate will be but the prelude of the destruction of
my husband. She therefore rouses him to do at once that from which
she knows nothing but fear of detection deters him; and, feeling that
there are no conscientious scruples to overcome, applies herself to
show that the present is the most favourable instant. It is for him
she thinks&mdash;for him she is unsexed&mdash;for his ambition she works&mdash;for
his safety she provides.</p>

<p>Up to the very murder, Macbeth displays no pity&mdash;no feeling for
anybody but himself. Fear of detection still haunts him, and no other
fear.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"Thou sure and steadfast earth,</div>
<div class="verse">Hear not my steps which way they walk, for fear</div>
<div class="verse">The very stones prate of my whereabout."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As Lady Macbeth says, it is the frustrated attempt, not the crime,
that can confound him. When it has been accomplished, he is for a
while visited by brain-sick fancies; and to her, who sees the necessity
of prompt action, is left the care of providing the measures best calculated
to avert the dreaded detection. She makes light of facing
the dead, and assures her husband that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"A little water clears us of this deed.</div>
<div class="verse">How easy it is then!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Does she indeed feel this? Are these the real emotions of her
mind? Does she think that a little water will wash out what has
been done, and that it is as easy to make all trace of it vanish from
the heart as from the hand? She shall answer us from her sleep, in
the loneliness of midnight, in the secrecy of her chamber. Bold was
her bearing, reckless and defying her tongue, when her husband was
to be served or saved; but the sigh bursting from her heavily-charged
breast, and her deep agony when she feels that, so far from its being
easy to get rid of the witness of murder, no washing can obliterate
the damned spot, no perfume sweeten the hand once redolent of
blood, prove that the recklessness and defiance were only assumed.
We find at last what she had sacrificed, how dreadful was the struggle
she had to subdue. Her nerve, her courage, mental and physical, was
unbroken during the night of murder; but horror was already seated
in her heart. Even then a touch of what was going on in her bosom
breaks forth. When urging Macbeth to act, she speaks as if she held
the strongest ties of human nature in contempt.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi4">"I have given suck, and know</div>
<div class="verse">How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:</div>
<div class="verse">I would, when it was smiling in my face,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums,</div>
<div class="verse">And dashed the brains out, had I but so sworn</div>
<div class="verse">As you have done to this."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Is she indeed so unnatural,&mdash;so destitute of maternal, of womanly
feeling? No. In the next scene we find her deterred from actual
participation in killing Duncan, because he resembled her father in
his sleep. This is not the lady to pluck the nipple from the boneless
gums of her infant, and dash out its brains. Her language is exaggerated
in mere bravado, to taunt Macbeth's infirmity of purpose
by a comparison with her own boasted firmness; but if the case had
arisen, she who had recoiled from injuring one whose life stood in the
way of her husband's hopes from a fancied resemblance to her father,
would have seen in the smile of her child a talisman of resistless
protection.</p>

<p>The murder done, and her husband on the throne, she is no
longer implicated in guilt. She is unhappy in her elevation, and
writhes under a troubled spirit in the midst of assumed gaiety. She
reflects with a settled melancholy that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi6">"Nought's had, all's spent,</div>
<div class="verse">When our desire is got without content.</div>
<div class="verse">'Tis safer to be that which we destroy,</div>
<div class="verse">Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This to herself. To cheer her lord, she speaks a different language
in the very next line.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,</div>
<div class="verse">Of sorriest fancies your companions making;</div>
<div class="verse">Using those thoughts which should indeed have died</div>
<div class="verse">With those they think on?"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Her own thoughts, we have just seen, were full as sorry as those of
her husband; but she can wear a mask. Twice only does she appear
after her accession to the throne; once masked, once unmasked.
Once seated at high festival, entertaining the nobles of her realm,
full of grace and courtesy, performing her stately hospitalities with
cheerful countenance, and devising with rare presence of mind
excuses for the distracted conduct of her husband. Once again,
when all guard is removed, groaning in despair.</p>

<p>The few words she says to Macbeth after the guests have departed,
almost driven out by herself, mark that her mind is completely
subdued. She remonstrates with him at first for having
broken up the feast; but she cannot continue the tone of reproof,
when she finds that his thoughts are bent on gloomier objects.
Blood is for ever on his tongue. She had ventured to tell
him that the visions which startle him, were but the painting of his
brain, and that he was unmanned in folly. He takes no heed of what
she says, and continues to speculate, at first in distraction, then in
dread, and lastly in savage cruelty, upon blood. The apparition of
Banquo almost deprives him of his senses. He marvels that such
things could be, and complains that a cruel exception to the ordinary
laws of nature is permitted in his case. Blood, he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"&mdash;&mdash;has been shed ere now in the olden time,</div>
<div class="verse">Ere human statute purged the gentle weal,"&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and in more civilized times also; but, when death came, no further
consequences followed. Now not even twenty mortal murders [he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
remembered the number of deadly gashes reported by the assassin]
will keep the victim in his grave. As long as Banquo's ghost remains
before him, he speaks in the same distracted strain. When
the object of his special wonder, by its vanishing, gives him time to
reflect, fear of detection, as usual, is his first feeling.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The most improbable witnesses have detected murder. Stones,
trees, magotpies, choughs, have disclosed the secretest man of blood.
Then come cruel resolves, to rid himself of his fears. Mercy or
remorse is to be henceforward unknown; the firstlings of his heart
are to be the firstlings of his hand,&mdash;the bloody thought is to be followed
instantly by the bloody deed. The tiger is now fully aroused
in his soul.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse vi12">"I am in blood</div>
<div class="verse">Stept in so far, that, should I wade no more,</div>
<div class="verse">Returning were as tedious as go o'er."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He sees an enemy in every castle; everywhere he plants his spies;
from every hand he dreads an attempt upon his life. Nearly two
centuries after the play was written, the world beheld one of its
fairest portions delivered to a rule as bloody as that of the Scottish
tyrant; and so true to nature are the conceptions of Shakspeare, that
the speeches of mixed terror and cruelty, which he has given to
Macbeth, might have been uttered by Robespierre. The atrocities
of the Jacobin, after he had stept so far in blood, were dictated by
fear. "Robespierre," says a quondam satellite,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> "devenait plus
sombre; son air renfrogné repoussait tout le monde; il ne parlait que
d'assassinat, encore d'assassinat, toujours d'assassinat. Il avait peur
que son ombre ne l'assassinât."</p>

<p>Lady Macbeth sees this grisly resolution, and ceases to remonstrate
or interfere. Her soul is bowed down before his, and he communicates
with her no longer. He tells her to be ignorant of what
he plans, until she can applaud him for what he has done. When he
abruptly asks her,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"How say'st thou,&mdash;that Macduff denies his person</div>
<div class="verse">At our great bidding?"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>she, well knowing that she has not said anything about it, and that
the question is suggested by his own fear and suspicion, timidly inquires,</p>

<p class="linequot">"Have you sent to him, <em>sir</em>?"</p>

<p>The last word is an emphatic proof that she is wholly subjugated.
Too well is she aware of the cause, and the consequence, of Macbeth's
<em>sending</em> after Macduff; but she ventures not to hint. She is no longer
the stern-tongued lady urging on the work of death, and taunting her
husband for his hesitation. She now addresses him in the humbled
tone of an inferior; we now see fright and astonishment seated on her
face. He tells her that she marvels at his words, and she would fain
persuade herself that they are but the feverish effusions of an overwrought
mind. Sadly she says,</p>

<p class="linequot">"You lack the season of all nature,&mdash;sleep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>
<p>Those are the last words we hear from her waking lips; and with a
hope that repose may banish those murky thoughts from her husband's
mind, she takes, hand in hand with him, her tearful departure
from the stage; and seeks her remorse-haunted chamber, there
to indulge in useless reveries of deep-rooted sorrow, and to perish by
her own hand amid the crashing ruin of her fortunes, and the fall of
that throne which she had so fatally contributed to win.</p>

<p>He now consigns himself wholly to the guidance of the weird
sisters; and she takes no part in the horrors which desolate Scotland,
and rouse against him the insurrection of the enraged thanes. But
she clings to him faithfully in his downfall. All others except the
agents of his crimes, and his personal dependents, have abandoned
him; but she, with mind diseased, and a heart weighed down by the
perilous stuff of recollections that defy the operation of oblivious antidote,
follows him to the doomed castle of Dunsinane. It is evident
that he returns her affection, by his anxious solicitude about her
health, and his melancholy recital of her mental sufferings. He
shows it still more clearly by his despairing words when the tidings
of her death are announced. Seyton delays to communicate it; but
at last the truth must come,&mdash;that the queen is dead. It is the overflowing
drop in his cup of misfortune.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"She should have died hereafter;&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">There would have been a time for such a word."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I might have borne it at some other time; but now&mdash;now&mdash;now that
I am deserted by all&mdash;penned in my last fortress&mdash;feeling that the
safeguards in which I trusted are fallacious,&mdash;now it is indeed the
climax of my calamity, that she, who helped me to rise to what she
thought was prosperity and honour,&mdash;who clung to me through a
career that inspired all else with horror and hate,&mdash;and who, in sickness
of body, and agony of mind, follows me in the very desperation
of my fate, should at such an hour be taken from me,&mdash;I am now
undone indeed. He then, for the first time, reflects on the brief and
uncertain tenure of life. He has long dabbled in death, but it never
before touched himself so closely. He is now aweary of the sun&mdash;now
finds the deep curses which follow him, sufficiently loud to
pierce his ear&mdash;now discovers that he has already lived long enough&mdash;and
plunges into the combat, determined, if he has lived the life of
a tyrant, to die the death of a soldier, with harness on his back.
Surrender or suicide does not enter his mind; with his habitual
love of bloodshed, he feels a savage pleasure in dealing gashes
all around; and at last, when he finds the charms on which he depended,
of no avail, flings himself, after a slight hesitation, into headlong
conflict with the man by whose sword he knows he is destined
to fall, with all the reckless fury of despair. What had he now to
care for? The last tie that bound him to human kind was broken
by the death of his wife, and it was time that his tale of sound and
fury should come to its appropriate close.</p>

<p>Thus fell he whom Malcolm in the last speech of the play calls
"the dead butcher," By the same tongue Lady Macbeth is stigmatised
as the fiend-like queen. Except her share in the murder of
Duncan,&mdash;which is, however, quite sufficient to justify the epithet in
the mouth of his son,&mdash;she does nothing in the play to deserve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
title; and for her crime she has been sufficiently punished by a life
of disaster and remorse. She is not the tempter of Macbeth. It
does not require much philosophy to pronounce that there were no
such beings as the weird sisters; or that the voice that told the Thane
of Glamis that he was to be King of Scotland, was that of his own
ambition. In his own bosom was brewed the hell-broth, potent to
call up visions counselling tyranny and blood; and its ingredients
were his own evil passions and criminal hopes. Macbeth himself
only believes as much of the predictions of the witches as he desires.
The same prophets, who foretold his elevation to the throne, foretold
also that the progeny of Banquo would reign; and yet, after the completion
of the prophecy so far as he is himself concerned, he endeavours
to mar the other part by the murder of Fleance. The
weird sisters are, to him, no more than the Evil Spirit which, in
Faust, tortures Margaret at her prayers. They are but the personified
suggestions of his mind. She, the wife of his bosom, knows
the direction of his thoughts; and, bound to him in love, exerts every
energy, and sacrifices every feeling, to minister to his hopes and
aspirations. This is her sin, and no more. He retains, in all his
guilt and crime, a fond feeling for his wife. Even when meditating
slaughter, and dreaming of blood, he addresses soft words of conjugal
endearment; he calls her "dearest chuck," while devising assassinations,
with the fore-knowledge of which he is unwilling to sully her
mind. Selfish in ambition, selfish in fear, his character presents no
point of attraction but this one merit. Shakspeare gives us no hint
as to her personal charms, except when he makes her describe her hand
as "little." We may be sure that there were few "more thoroughbred
or fairer fingers," in the land of Scotland than those of its
queen, whose bearing in public towards Duncan, Banquo, and the
nobles, is marked by elegance and majesty; and, in private, by affectionate
anxiety for her sanguinary lord. He duly appreciated her
feelings, but it is pity that such a woman should have been united to
such a man. If she had been less strong of purpose, less worthy of
confidence, he would not have disclosed to her his ambitious designs;
less resolute and prompt of thought and action, she would not
have been called on to share his guilt; less sensitive or more hardened,
she would not have suffered it to prey for ever like a vulture
upon her heart. She affords, as I consider it, only another instance
of what women will be brought to, by a love which listens to no considerations,
which disregards all else beside, when the interests, the
wishes, the happiness, the honour, or even the passions, caprices,
and failings of the beloved object are concerned; and if the world, in
a compassionate mood, will gently scan the softer errors of sister-woman,
may we not claim a kindly construing for the motives which
plunged into the Aceldama of this blood-washed tragedy the sorely
urged and broken-hearted Lady Macbeth?</p>

<p class="author"><cite>Motto of Undertakers' Mystery. Free translation.</cite></p>


<p>A certain philosopher once said, with a degree of truth that
proved the strength of his own head and the weakness of the human
nature he was anatomizing, that "many men could easily bring themselves
to <em>practise</em> those things they would in nowise permit to be
<em>preached</em> to them." He saw the line of distinction between virtue in
<em>thought</em> and virtue in action,&mdash;the ease with which we could have the
former, the difficulty of possessing in practice the latter; he knew
how easy it is to be good when and where there is no temptation to
the contrary; he knew the proneness of people thus luckily located
on the top of Fortune's wheel, to inquire with seeming wonder wherefore
they who were being pulverized beneath the bottom of the same,&mdash;the
pulverization being no jot the pleasanter from the obvious fact of
the inquirer's weight being on the top,&mdash;why the discontented fellows
presumed to be so uncomfortable, when their superiors made so many
inquiries after their well-being; he knew that the top wheelmen were
but too apt to argue about the fellows below as if they were of themselves,
and to conclude that it was as wicked a thing for a man to
steal a penny loaf when starving, as for an alderman to do the same
thing, whose well-turtled stomach would bring the robbery into an act
of wanton appropriation, only to be explained by his superabundant
organ of acquisitiveness. In short, respectable reader, he knew what
we all know, after he has made it clear, that the <em>degree</em> in which we
practise what we will not permit to be preached to us, is proof of
human weakness, and measure of the want of health in our personal
morals. It is a confession of our inability to act up to our conception
of virtue; and the cherishing the theory of good without making the
practice follow after, is a postponement of active virtue <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</i>. Or
if we beat away that pertinacious dun, conscience, by saying, "Ah!
never mind, I'll start with bran-new morals next year," it is only like
moving that a bill be read this day six months,&mdash;a humane method of
knocking the measure on the head without the unfeeling necessity of
saying in so many words that knocking is to be its entertainment.</p>

<p>Now, if I were to say,&mdash;which I feel very much disposed to do,&mdash;that
cutting one's own throat (where there are no kindred feelings to
be cut)&mdash;"that cutting one's own throat in this case was a very proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
thing,&mdash;where a man likes it," I should at once have a cloud of the
schoolmen upon me, each with the weapons his master of the ordnance,
Paley, has supplied to him, proving, until breath, temper, and
text were exhausted, that I am a presumptuous puppy in imagining
for one moment that I have any property at all in my own throat,
which is given to me for the good of society, and not to be cut by
and for me, and my proper satisfaction. This would be the language
of these "top wheelmen,"&mdash;fellows who are far too comfortable not to
wish to be as immortal as a corporation, and who therefore doubt my
sanity in not being as jolly as themselves,&mdash;like the young princess
to her miserable little subject, "What is the matter with you?&mdash;how
can you cry? <em>I</em> am very happy?" "Live," says the archdeacon, as
he wipes his mulligatawnied mouth with his napkin;&mdash;"live," cries he
to the lank-cheeked fellow who has been fished out of the river
against his will, whither he had gone to stop the disagreeable function
of breathing on a scanty supply of bread;&mdash;"<em>live</em>," cries the archdeacon,&mdash;"life
you cannot give, life you cannot take. You are
placed in this world to run your course; you must run it accordingly.
How soon it may require your aid, you do not know; at any rate,
when it is fit you should retire hence, you will be <em>called</em> hence; rush
not uncalled-for, into the other world. I am sorry for you; here is
half-a-crown; and, John," turning to the footman, who has been picking
the crumbs of morality falling from the rich man's mouth, "<em>John,
show this poor man out</em>." The poor man, with a sad aspect and a
slow pace, crawls toward the door; and looks as if, did not deferential
modesty restrain him, he would reply to the good archdeacon in
these words. As the old man has seen them, and owned, with wonder
at our penetration, that they correctly exhibit the thoughts at that time
passing through his brain, we at once put the reader in possession.
"Live, my dear sir! I am quite willing to do so; it is what I have
been in vain struggling to do. Live! Have not the slightest objection;
but then I <em>must</em> live; <em>you</em>, your honour, have said you could not afford
to keep a conscience, although you doubtless think it a very good
thing among people who <em>can</em> afford to do so; indeed I know well your
<em>writings</em> venerate many things your <em>acts</em> do not, for want of this article
you cannot afford to keep. So my abstract admission must be
given to all arguments against suicide in the main, reserving a particular
conclusion for myself, <em>viz</em>. that to attempt to live without money
is quite as bad as cutting off my legs, in order to pit myself in a
walking-match against Mr. Coates. I shudder, Mr. Paley, as deeply
as yourself at the general idea of suicide; but, in reference to particular
cases, it's all a matter of cash. <em>You</em> cannot afford to keep a
conscience, another man cannot afford to keep a mistress, a third
finds the keeping <em>himself</em> beyond the capacity of his exchequer: the
first denies himself the luxury of a conscience for the present, the
second puts his lady quietly away, the third puts himself in a pond
quietly and comfortably." The would-be suicide was quite right: as
the profound estimator of political tactics some time back remarked,
in reference to the gladiatorial exercises of the factions of the day,
"it's all a matter of 'wittals:'" necessity compels us to do what principle
will not hear preached by others; so that I almost despair of
miseries great as mine making out a claim for mortality, and apprehend
that only a few very sensible people will say at the end of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
paper, "There, <em>go, my good fellow, and hang yourself</em>, as soon as you
can beg, borrow, or steal a sufficient bit of cord for that laudable
purpose."</p>

<p>Yet if there be one moral truth clearer, stronger, and less assailable
than another, it is that, in some circumstances, "self-murder" is the
most virtuous act a man can perform. A burthen to himself, an annoyance
to the world, no relatives or connexions to regret his loss,
may not an intentional stopping of the breathing function be the best
act he can commit for all sides? The utilitarian will say "<em>Yes</em>,"
among whom we rank the Paleyites, all of whom were and are utilitarians;
the old-fashioned addlepates will shake their heads, take
snuff, and finally declare that a good deal may be said on both sides.</p>

<p>The above useful reflections, as well as those that immediately follow,
had their origin on the third step above high-water mark of Waterloo
Bridge.</p>

<p>I was thinking about providing for myself in the flood beneath, and
after mature reflection concluded I had better not. They are your
"thinkers" about it who never do the thing,&mdash;a man who is always
thinking about marrying is sure to die an old bachelor. Hamlet
thought about killing his uncle so long, that that very immoral elderly
gentleman had very nearly slipped through his reflective nephew's
fingers; and so a man who thinks about throwing himself in
the water is sure to conclude the argument as I did, by turning
round and walking up the steps. Indeed death's a nasty thing; we
go to it as to a last resource, sharp though sure, as the young woman
said on handling the hatchet that was to dissociate her head and
shoulders. The watery form of it has its advantages and disadvantages;
there is little pain, but it is cold, plashy, sneaking, and kitten-killing
in its general style: the warmest imagination cannot save the
body from a certain shiver as the thing is contemplated; at least that
was my experience on the third step aforementioned. I tried to fancy
that it was but a sort of hydrostatic bed without the expense of the
India-rubber casing. It was of no use; active memory recurred to the
attitudinizings of a fine growing family of young mousers whom in early
life I had introduced to the cold comfort of a pail of water; and at
the reminiscence my blood ran colder than the water at my feet.
With a quiet rippling plash it washed along the step. It sounded to
the ear as if old Charon called from the bottom, ready to start over
that other stream to which this merely branch canal must conduct us.
Bright and tempting it ran at my feet, ready to conceal both me and
my sorrows. But the foolish instinct for life prevailed within me; I
returned to walk the streets at night,&mdash;an employment from which I
had thought, ten minutes before, <em>death</em> would be a happy relief; a delusion
which the being confronted with it soon dissipated. In walking
up the steps I felt as one who had been reprieved, to whom life
in its worst aspects would be infinitely preferable to that 'hereafter'
which the fancy studs with such dimly awful horrors.</p>

<p>"Stuff!" I hear some one say who is reading this perhaps on a
full stomach; "nonsense! a happy relief from walking about the
streets, indeed! the fellow does not know what to write about." So
would not poor old Dr. Johnson have said after one of <em>his</em> street vagabondizings,
when he sate down to write the essay whose signature
"Impransus," indicated the dinnerless state of the writer's stomach;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
so would not <em>he</em> have said; no, nor his wandering chum, Savage: warm
tears would have coursed down their rough cheeks, for they knew
what it was in <em>their</em> time; and living in the streets, notwithstanding
the improvement of the paving, is not much more desirable now than
it was in their time, or in the old time before them.</p>

<p>It is only at night,&mdash;and that cold, drizzly, and muddy,&mdash;you can feel
in its full force the misery that is foodless and houseless. In the day
the busy streets are thronged with the crowds drifting along, intent
on their respective objects. Then, houseless though you be, you feel
no consciousness of it from contrast: purposeless as you are, the fact
is known to none but yourself, and you enjoy the poor privilege of
promenading the pavement free from staring remark or official interruption.
But at night, about twelve or half-past, the theatre-frequenters
hurrying home, happy shopmen returning from their sweethearts,
and attorneys' clerks and small joyous shopboys, cigar in
mouth, hastening to their quiet beds, the very poorest Cyprian, perhaps,
staggering away in silence and ginny stupor to her squalid
room,&mdash;then you feel that you are not one of the mass; it is the
school-boy sensation of strangeness in a new school, carried up and
increased into one's manhood; you are a misfit in society,&mdash;of no
use; a shoe-black, a hackney-coachman, a costermonger are respectable
in your eyes, for each of these holds a department in the great
game of life. If you walk fast, the tears come into your eyes at the
thought of the sad mockery of people with homes,&mdash;for <em>where</em> should
<em>you</em> walk <em>to</em>? You slink from street to street, shivering and broken-spirited;
afraid to pause, lest the searching eye of the policeman shall
for one moment mistake the unfortunate for a thief; and tremblingly
shunning to stretch your weary limbs in a doorway, tempting as it
looks, that your miseries shall not the next morning be presented to
a police office, and published to the world. In fine, you almost feel
that the "<em>world would move on much the same even if you were dead
and buried</em>,"&mdash;a root-and-branch cutting-up of one's self-esteem that
may be called the last conviction of the dejected.</p>

<p>Many are the poor wretches who for months pass through such an
existence as this. If men, enlistment is a last resource: if women,
prostitution, paint, gin, and jollity that would look wonderfully <em>like</em>
happiness were it not so <em>loud</em>, low spirits, laudanum, or Waterloo
steps; paragraph in newspapers&mdash;old story&mdash;seduction and suicide&mdash;fine
young woman&mdash;parents in the country; penny-a-liner pockets
his fee, and keeps the "<em>form</em>" of his female biography open for the
next name the same set of circumstances may bring to him.</p>

<p>There is something awfully desolate in walking the streets through
a night, passing across that dark gulf of the four-and-twenty which is
a sort of temporary banishment from humanity,&mdash;that on-and-on purposeless
tramp from the coming down of the darkness to the dawning
of light, passing perhaps not two persons within the space of a
mile; the solitary pad of our feet on the pavement; the sombre and
dim hue of the streets relieved by the gas; the seemingly unnatural
quiet in a place old custom tells us should be so noisy; the strange
feeling that we are watching and thinking, whilst the vast Leviathan
of toil, and luxury, and woe, and pleasure, has run its daily course,
and is now snatching from the Lethe of sleep the instalment of energy
for the next day's career. What passions and aspirations, what purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
of pomp and glory, of wickedness and virtue, what golden glories
of the poet's brain quenched, or flickering in the twilight of
dream, the strategy of the politician, all plunged into the "death of
each day's life!" What a time, what a scene for reflection, with the
deep, and awful, and warning gong of old Paul's clock striking two,
in a tone which, plain as words, tells us how time with flying foot runs
from us,&mdash;and all the humbler fry of iron pots in the metropolis plagiarising
the sad fact tolled forth by their grave old leader! The streets
are completely empty; the very policeman has slunk into some early
house, and we feel like the last man.</p>

<p>And who will wonder, after this course repeated with little variation
for a respectable period of three or four months, that a man
looks upon a dissolution of partnership with this lower life as the best
fate open to him? Why should one in this state stay longer among
men, when no occupation can be secured which will rescue him from
indifference, or shield him from contempt? Why should moralists,
like Paley, try to stay his purpose by flinging the salt of their sapiency
on his tail, when his only ambition, like Goldsmith's George
Primrose, is to <em>live</em>, and that humble aim thwarted at every avenue
by the grim visage of starvation staring him in the face? It is time
he is gone. Let him unlock his soul from its painful prison, and send
it cleaving its way in the joy of emancipation to those regions where
the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. Without
wife or children, brothers, sisters, or cousins, grandfathers or grandmothers,
dogs, cats, or birds, which can call with the voice either of
nature or custom for my personal presence here below, why should <em>I</em>
be tied by the leg with a moral "ne exeat mundo?" I <em>am my own</em>,&mdash;not
a chop or a cutlet of me belonging to my creditors, for I am out
of debt; and surely, I repeat, I may do what I like with my own.
"You are <em>not your own</em>," again cries my moralist, attempting to throw
a net of words over my mind about relative and social duties, society
and its incidents, law of civilization, &amp;c.&mdash;the whole leading to a sort
of conclusion that if the world may not want me <em>now</em>, there is no
saying the time will not come when it may find out what an indispensable
person I am; and upon the dependence of this "may want"
I am to hang about in the outer hall of this sublunary state, until
those very comfortable fellows within, happen to think of us shivering
without, and promote us to the pleasures of their well-plenished
table. Truly we must wait long for this,&mdash;perhaps until an earthquake
comes, and they call for our assistance in fishing them up
through the bricks and beams of their fallen chambers.</p>

<p>No, no; Mr. Creech was quite right, if he thought himself so, in
writing on the margin of his Lucretius, "When I have finished my
translation, I must kill myself." That gentleman took the extended
and philosophical view of the subject; life was to him something to
be and to do; to be a translator, to do Lucretius, and then to do for
the personal estate of Mr. Creech in this world, in order to translate
the accidents and chances of personalty into the settled and comfortable
remainder of eternity. Cool, philosophical man! what refinement
of reflection, to come to regard the act of letting out life with
as little perturbation as ordinary men contemplate eating their dinners!
To translate Lucretius was his task; performed, he was to
kill himself: a silk-weaver has to weave so many yards of his fabric;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
done, he promises himself with his wife and little ones a walk in the
fields. In both cases there is a duty to fulfil, in both cases the emancipation
follows; both must we subject to the same test in endeavouring
to settle their respective characters,&mdash;the necessity or obligation
of the translator on the one hand, or the weaver on the other,
loitering in the world, or the workshop, after their work is executed.
The only difference is an affair of time and distance; the one being
bound, as he thinks, for the <em>Elysian</em>, the other and humbler for the
<em>Marylebone</em> fields.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear sir," cries the reader, "I see you are intent on
your <em>point</em>. I shall perhaps only waste my lungs and logic in trying
to beat you away from your delusion; but reflect, sir, the tendency&mdash;how
catching&mdash;the imitative faculty in man,&mdash;lateral organ largely developed."
Fiddlestick!&mdash;away with your organs and developements!
An old gentleman, who has read all qualities of human dealing in a
learned spirit, writes as follows:&mdash;"All I will venture to assert with
confidence is, that there is no reason to apprehend that suicide will
become an epidemic malady. Nature has provided too well for that.
<em>Hope and fear are too powerful as inducements</em> not to frequently <em>stop
the hands of a wretch about to terminate his own life</em>."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is useless blinking the moral fact, that suicide is as
natural a result of compared good and evil as any other act in life.
In every case (not excepting those of insanity) we shall find it takes
that shape. Whether it be Mr. Creech, who sits down and stares
death out of countenance with a familiarity that must have disconcerted
the conceit of the omnipotent old commissioner,&mdash;or one with
blasted hopes, like myself,&mdash;or blighted ambition, like old Anthony,&mdash;or
repulsed patriotism, like Brutus,&mdash;the process is the same in all,&mdash;comparison
of the inestimable evils of life with the presumed quiet and
rest of the grave, and action in accordance with the conclusion. Men
are not cowards for not living to face evils, for the mere sake of
facing them without any other result; they are men of policy and
magnanimity to quit, when the grappling with them can alone be
productive of a self-destruction of a more painful and protracted character,
or at best exhibitory of an idle and vain bravery of bearing,
of no avail either one way or the other. They are not cowards, and
no imputation of cowardice will prevent them following out the clear
conceptions that are shaped from their exigencies, any more than it
would deter one in a burning ship at sea from casting himself overboard,
rather than become an insulated and floating roast; or than it
shall prevent me, when I have made an end of this confession, plaiting
my garters for the office of strangulation, if after the plait is
finished I entertain the same fixed principles on the subject as I do
at present.</p>

<span class="f90 smcap">Chapter II.</span></h2>

<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY TOBY ALLSPY.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<h3>THE FIVE FLOORS.</h3>


<p>To the best of our belief, Paris is the only city in Europe where a
prize is annually distributed for the encouragement of <span class="smcap">Virtue</span>. In
England&mdash;that Joseph Surface of the civilized globe&mdash;we give premiums
for the growth of fat sheep and piccotees, we boast of prize-oxen
and prize-heartsease; but at present we have no prize-virtue.
The celebrated benefaction founded by Monsieur de Monthyon (confided
to the administration of the French Academy) consists in annual
premiums for the production of the finest trait of moral excellence,
and the literary work best calculated to promote its recurrence.</p>

<p>Now, Monsieur Bonc&oelig;ur, of the first-floor of the corner of the Rue
Montmartre, might have monopolised the whole Monthyon endowment
for the last fifteen years. The whole man was an incarnate
virtue; his works, literary or literal, were based upon the strictest morality.
From his top-knot to his shoe-tie, propriety predominated.
Methodical in his hours and diet, regular as a chronometer in despatch
of business, he insured his own ease of mind and body by scrupulous
exactitude in the discharge of their duties and pleasures. His apartment
was a model of commodiousness,&mdash;doors and windows shutting
to a hair; not a draught of air, not a creaking hinge, not an unsteady
table, not a hard-shutting drawer, not an easy-opening lock in the
whole suite. The floors in summer were as polished as their master's
demeanour, the carpets in winter as soft as his address. No grand
displays of fragile luxury, of Japan porcelain or Bohemian glass,
alarmed the anxieties of Monsieur Bonc&oelig;ur's constituency. It was
the "comfortable" in perfection,&mdash;but nothing more.</p>

<p>What wonder that a man thus basking in the sunshine of prudent
prosperity should bask in the favour of the world?&mdash;that such an
ornament to society should be incorporated in all the learned and
charitable societies of the city?&mdash;that so worthy a fellow should be a
fellow of every academy and literary association? A string of conventional
distinctions was attached to Bonc&oelig;ur's name, vying in length
with the catalogue of chivalric honours appended in German almanacks
to that of Prince Metternich; but, what was more to the purpose,
the patronymic thus honoured was inscribed in every public
stock or fund, domestic or foreign. His house was a house of universal
bondage. Not a railroad could be started by government till
Bonc&oelig;ur had been closeted in the stuffy, fussy, great-talking-little-doing
cabinet of the Home Department; nor a minister accredited,
till he had hinted his hints and inferred his inferences in the sphinxical
blue-chamber of the Foreign. The worsted epaulettes of that all-conciliating
monarch, the citizen king, were observed to bow lower to
their excellent and much-esteemed friend Monsieur Bonc&oelig;ur than
to any other of the golden calves invited to feed and ruminate at the
royal rack and manger of the Tuileries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the inhabitants of the house whose <em>cordon</em> was pulled by
Madame Grégoire, Bonc&oelig;ur may be considered as at once the least
and the most domestic. His business lay elsewhere,&mdash;his pleasures
lay elsewhere; it was only his respectability that lodged in ostentatious
comfort in the first-floor of that memorable dwelling. He knew
and cared nothing concerning the neighbours. On his progress from
his apartment to his carriage, from his carriage back to his apartment,
the banker's countenance expressed only a mild, imperturbable
magnanimity, looking neither to the right nor left, but enwrapt in
reminiscences of the panacean speech he had been delivering to
the Chamber, in proof to the kingdom that it paid no taxes, but lay
stretched upon a bed of roses. One day, however, when his ascent
happened to be more mercurial than usual, he came suddenly in contact
with Claire de Courson, whose slight figure was bending under
the weight of a piece of furniture which she was carrying up to her
mother's room; and her pure complexion became suffused with the
deepest blushes as she acknowledged and declined his polite offers of
assistance in her task. Next day, Robert the footman, who had been
deputed to relieve her from the burthen of the elbow-chair, was commissioned
to convey the "Follet" and apricot marmalade in the same
direction. Till that memorable epoch, the virtuous Monsieur Bonc&oelig;ur
had remained ignorant that the house contained so powerful
an incentive to the fulfilment of the Christian commandment to love
his neighbour as himself. But it was not too late. The banker was
fond of apricot marmalade, and partial to the prettinesses of a fashionable
magazine,&mdash;his fair neighbour of an age to share his predilections;
and, in presenting these saccharine offerings, he did as he
would be done by. The virtuous Monsieur Bonc&oelig;ur was too painfully
aware, however, of the scandal-mongering propensities of a
sinful world to entrust to the remarks of a common staircase and
porter's lodge the visits of a bachelor first-floor to a single third-floor,
with large grey eyes, long black eyelashes, and the shape of a nymph.
His respectable Robert, a corpulent middle-aged footman, might in
the first instance represent his high-principled principal, without provoking
the espionage of Ma'mselle Berthe, or the commentations of
Madame Grégoire. In the intimacy he hoped to establish, all the
advances must come down stairs. The man after the king's own
heart was too prudent to stir a single step upward.</p>

<p>Beyond the door of the antechamber, however, which was opened
by Mademoiselle de Courson in person, the corpulent footman did not
penetrate. The young lady returned, in her mother's name, a civil
answer of acknowledgment to their wealthy neighbour, stating that
the infirmities of her mother's health rendered it impossible for them
to receive visitors. The corpulent footman (despising these wretched
people,&mdash;as wretched people who keep no establishment of servants
ought to be despised by a corpulent footman,) immediately settled it
in his own mind that the apartment was too shabby and littered to
admit of receiving a gentleman of such far-famed respectability as the
eminent banker of the Rue Bergère; that the Coursons' furniture
was probably mean,&mdash;their fare meagre. The utmost stretch of his
pampered imagination did not conjecture that their fare consisted of
their furniture,&mdash;that ever since Madame's arrival with the truck, she
had been dining on chairs and breakfasting on feather-beds. Not a
soul in the house (except Guguste) had at present noticed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
<em>meubles</em> carried down and conveyed away "to be mended" never
found their way back again.</p>

<p>Small as were the appetites of the third-floor, it is extremely difficult
to feed and lodge two full-grown human beings upon a pension of
forty pounds a-year; and, by the recent failure of the notary in whose
hands the small funds of Madame de Courson were deposited, this
was all that remained to support her and her daughter. On the discovery
of their misfortune, indeed, Claire had undertaken to increase
her own and her mother's daily bread by assiduous needle-work; but
the constant attendance required by the poor and sorrowful invalid
rendered it difficult for her daughter to fulfil her good intentions.
Till the loss of their property, they had resided, in tolerable comfort,
in cheerful rooms on the Quai Voltaire, assisted by an effective servant;
but all this had been perforce resigned,&mdash;the best part of their
goods was sold off, their wardrobe stript of its luxuries, and Claire was
fully justified in undertaking, as she did, the service of the kitchen and
pantry; for it was clear that their diet must henceforward consist of
bread and water. Like most poor people, they were proud; and
pride served to increase their privations. Madame de Courson, the
widow of an officer, one of the victims of the Russian campaign, had
never yet solicited a pecuniary favour from living mortal. She preferred
working for her livelihood, or starving; that is, she preferred
that her daughter should work for their livelihood, and consequently
that they should starve together. It must be owned (<em>par parenthèse</em>)
that the only favours tendered to her acceptance since she took up her
domicile in the corner house, were Monsieur Bonc&oelig;ur's gift of
apricot marmalade and loan of a journal, and poor Guguste's earnest
entreaty to Mademoiselle, into whose acquaintance he had intruded
by carrying up Madame de Courson's first and last batch of wood, to
be permitted to black her shoes, and perform other little neighbourly
offices of similar delicacy. When, however, the shoes grew thinner
and thinner, without being replaced, his aid was more rarely accepted,
and at length positively declined; and little Guguste, who was more
a man of the world than the corpulent footman, justly concluded that
Mademoiselle Claire did not like to expose her attempts at repairing
the inevitable fissures to the comments of Monsieur Georges's lad of
all work. Still, though tacitly dismissed from her service, the grey-eyed
beauty never passed him on the stairs without a word or smile
of recognition, even when her heart was sorest and countenance saddest;
for Guguste had installed himself her friend. It remained to
be seen whether the donor of the apricot marmalade would prove as
true a one as the young shoeblack.</p>

<p>Be it not inferred, however, that the amiable attentions of the
ragamuffin page were paid solely as a tribute to beauty; they were a
tribute to beauty in distress. There were two other particles of the
fair sex resident under the same roof, whom most lads of his age
would have preferred to the grey-eyed nymph of the third-floor, viz.
Madame la Baronne de Gimbecque, a pretty widow, somewhere between
twenty-five and fifty years of age, (for in a well-dressed widow
it is extremely difficult to determine a woman's age within ten years
or so,&mdash;none but a lady's husband being admitted to investigate the
case before she</p>

<p>and Madame la Baronne de Gimbecque's coquettish waiting-maid,
Mademoiselle Aglaé. But for neither of these divinities of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entresol</i>
had Guguste ever felt inspired with an inclination to wield the
blacking-brush! Not that either the widow or the maid was at any
moment guilty of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaussure</i> susceptible of such plebeian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enchainement</i>:&mdash;Madame
la Baronne walked not only in silk attire, but silken
shoes; while Ma'mselle Aglaé, like Lear's soldiers, was shod with
felt, shuffling in slippers all the morning, and reserving prunella or
satin for her visits, play-goings, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bals masqués</i>.</p>

<p>Madame la Baronne, with a fortune of thirty thousand francs, or
twelve hundred pounds, per annum, would have passed in London
for a widow of moderate means, and might perhaps have speculated on
improving them by marriage. In Paris she passed for a rich one, and
occupied herself with her own amusement. It is amazing how much
pleasure may be purchased in that circumscript capital at the rate of
one hundred pounds per month, particularly in the state of blessedness
which is called single. Conscious of her advantage, Madame
de Gimbecque was far from anxious to inscribe herself in the register
of lodgers in the Rue Montmartre by double entry. France is peculiar
in its views of wedded happiness. In England, what is called
a well-assorted marriage implies parity of condition, and compatibility
of temper; in Paris, it implies equality of fortune. Five thousand
a-year proposes to five thousand a-year,&mdash;three hundred per annum
to three hundred; not Lord Thomas to Miss Sophia, or plain Tom to
pretty Sophy. Beauty, harp-playing, quadrilling, have nothing to do
with it,&mdash;all is matter of arithmetic! If the match turn out ill, it is
no fault of the matchmakers; all has been done according to Cocker.</p>

<p>Now Madame la Baronne, like most Frenchwomen, was a capital
calculatress. She knew that, though Sophy and Tom are richer with
six hundred a-year between them than Sophy with three and Tom
with the same pittance, a pretty Madame de Gimbecque, between
twenty-five and fifty years of age, is richer as a widow with thirty
thousand francs per annum, than as the wife of a man of fashion with
sixty. To espouse any man, <em>un</em>fashionable, was out of the question,&mdash;that
is, any man unfashionable with an income only equal to her own.
A Cr&oelig;sus of any age or calling would have brought his own apology;
and she would have added herself and her establishment to that of
the respectable banker of the Rue Bergère at a moment's notice.
But that consummation was past praying for. A Cr&oelig;sus would
require a Cr&oelig;sa as his partner for life, as surely as the primitive lion
trotted side by side with a lioness into Noah's ark; and Monsieur
Bonc&oelig;ur, if matrimonially inclined, would demand hundreds of
thousands per annum to amalgamate with his hundreds of thousands.
The charming Adolphes and exquisite Amédées, meanwhile, frequenting
Madame de Gimbecque's opera-box, or ambling by her side
in the Bois de Boulogne, had either not an unmortgaged estate
wherewith to pretend to her hand, or, if successful pretendants, would
appropriate after marriage to their own gratification, not only their
own thirty thousand, but three-fourths of hers. Very early in her
widowhood Madame de Gimbecque came to this conclusion; and, on
giving utterance at her toilet, as she threw off her widow's weeds, to
her anti-matrimonial intention, they were confirmed by Mademoiselle
Aglaé with so loud an "amen," that a by-stander might have supposed
them two lay-nuns pronouncing vows of eternal celibacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame de Gimbecque, though thus egoistical in her calculations,
was nevertheless a light-hearted, good-humoured little woman, who,
if she did not go out of her way to do good, did all the good that lay
in it. She had been born, bred, married, and widowed according to
that matter-of-fact social system of the French which leaves no
space for the expansion of the feelings. Nothing like affection had
graced her parents' household,&mdash;nothing like affection had warmed
her own. Her fifteen thousand francs per annum had been married
to those of an ex-colonel of cuirassiers, thirty years her senior, who
had pretty nearly scolded, sworn, smoked, and expectorated his
pretty wife out of patience, when the sour little cherub who sits up
aloft keeping watch over matrimonial destinies, took pity on the lady,
and took the colonel to itself.</p>

<p>Marianne de Gimbecque, (then <em>not</em> between fifty and five-and-twenty,
but between five-and-twenty and fifteen,) though an orphan
as well as a widow, consoled herself as thoroughly as propriety would
admit for this sudden bereavement. She had neither a tie nor a
relative in the world; but what pretty Parisian with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trente mille
francs de rente</i> can feel lonely, while there is an opera, a carnival, and
a milliner's shop in existence!</p>

<p>The baroness speedily set about improving her solitary hours. She
devoted herself to the cultivation of her charms, as an Englishwoman
might have done to the cultivation of her mind. Her accomplishments
as a cosmetician were really surprising; she studied the art as
a branch of natural history; not a perfumer in Paris could have
deceived her as to the ingredients of a wash, or chemical compounds
of a pommade. She knew what acids would injure the enamel of her
teeth, what astringents wither the smooth surface of her cheek, what
spirituous infusions turn her sable locks to iron-grey or silver, as well
as Berthollet or "Sromfridevé." She could tell what atmospheric
changes enabled her to exchange blue ribbons for pink, without compromise
of the becoming; and regulated by the phases of the moon
her ebbs and flows between cap, hat, and turban.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more artistically managed than the apartment of
the little coquette. Nothing, by the way, is so <em>easy</em> to render
coquettish as an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entresol</i>, which is, in fact, a series of boudoirs: saloons
like those of Devonshire House, or a hall like that of Stafford,
must be stately and ostentatious; the trickery of prettiness would
be as much out of place in such places as rouge and pearl powder on
the marble cheek of Michael Angelo's Moses. But a light airy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entresol</i>,
or <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mezzonino</i> story, whose windows, fronting the south, are shaded
by Genoese awnings, overhanging balconies, filled with geraniums,
heliotropes, and mignonette,&mdash;whose anteroom is painted blue
stripewise, to represent a tent, and whose dining-room is varnished
scagliola fashion,&mdash;whose drawing-room is of white and gold, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fauteuils</i>
and divans of yellow satin, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabarets</i> of pale Saxon blue porcelain,
adorned with shepherds, shepherdesses, and garlands of carnations,&mdash;the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">consoles</i> of varnished maple, white as snow, or as the
single marble table, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">taillé en bloc</i>, which sustains a scentless exotic in
a vase of pale-green Sèvres,&mdash;whose boudoir is a tent of white muslin,
drawn over dove-coloured <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gros de Naples</i>,&mdash;whose bed-room is hung
with cachemere spotted with palm-leaves, leading to a bath-room
altogether spotless, and lined with mirrors;&mdash;such an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entresol</i> is a
paradise for a Peri, (whose age is between twenty-five and fifty!) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
such was the one inhabited in the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre by
Madame la Baronne de Gimbecque!</p>

<p>The household was concomitant. A page in a neat livery, a powdered-headed
middle-aged sobriety of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d'hôtel</i>, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</i> of sufficient
merit for a lady neither a dinner-giver nor dinner-devotee; and,
to complete the measure, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soubrette</i>, the waiting-maid, the spruce,
cunning, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pimpante</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fringante</i>, Mademoiselle Aglaé, with her embroidered
cambric aprons and pink ribbons;&mdash;one pennyworth of waiting-maid
to all this monstrous quantity of male-faction! The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître
d'hôtel</i> dusted the china, the page rubbed the floors,&mdash;everything but
the lady's toilet being performed in France by slaves of the masculine
gender. Monsieur Simon, the sober <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d'hôtel</i>, and Lindor, the
pert page, sometimes suggested to their mistress's mistress that an
additional petticoat would be far more advantageous to the establishment
than entertaining a workwoman fifteen days in the month for
the care of the household linen; but the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de chambre</i> would not
hear of it. She chose to be the sole Helen in Troy; and, though
devoid of personal views on either page or butler,&mdash;the cook in his
white paper <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casquette</i>, or the coachman in his flaxen wig,&mdash;resolved to
admit no rival near the throne of her soubrettish autocracy. It was
quite plague enough to have the house frequented by Eugène de
Marsan, (the handsome cousin-german of the ugly defunct ex-colonel
of cuirassiers, Monsieur le Baron Nicodême de Gimbecque,) and
Claude de Bercy, (the popular author of seventy-five successful vaudevilles,)
without encumbering the little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entresol</i> (or its double entrance,
double staircase, and corridor, appropriately named in Paris
"of escape,") with such lumber as a chambermaid.</p>

<p>"Has Madame Oudot sent home my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foulard peignoir</i>?" demanded
Madame la Baronne of her waiting-maid, as she lay reclining in her
marble-bath, whose tepid warmth served to diffuse through the little
room the aroma of the eau de Ninon which Mademoiselle Aglaé was
sprinkling on the surface.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Non, madame!</i> Yet I was particular in making her promise it
for yesterday, knowing that Madame expected a visit from Monsieur
Eugène before she dressed to take her ride."</p>

<p>"Tiresome woman!" cried the lady in the bath,&mdash;an apostrophe
which Aglaé of course applied to the unpunctual <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couturière</i>. "Give
me the new number of 'Le Bon Ton,' and in five minutes ring for my
chocolate, and bring in my warm linen,&mdash;not sooner, or it will be cold
before I am ready."</p>

<p>The waiting-maid obeyed; but finding on the marble slab in the
corridor the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Constitutionnel</i>, damp from the press, she held it for a
moment over the drying-basket of the bath-linen, and returned to her
lady, taking the liberty, as she slowly paced the room, to cast an eye
upon the news of the morning.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacristie! ce cher Monsieur Bonc&oelig;ur!</i> another audience of the
king!" exclaimed Mademoiselle Aglaé, presenting the paper to her
lady, who extended to receive it, a languid hand, humid with the perfumed
exhalations of the bath.</p>

<p>"Doubtless about his title," she replied.</p>

<p>"<em>Title!</em>" inquired the waiting-maid, fearing she might be about to
forfeit the envied distinction of belonging to the only household of
quality in the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you that our neighbour overhead had purchased the
estate of D'Offémont, and was trying to obtain the royal sanction to
assume the name? Ay, exactly: the King, I perceive, has created
him a baron; not D'Offémont, however,&mdash;he is to be Baron de Bonc&oelig;ur.
What people this government <em>does</em> ennoble!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Bonc&oelig;ur has one of the greatest names in the monied
world," remonstrated the waiting-woman: "he is mayor of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrondissement</i>,
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marguiller</i> of the parish."</p>

<p>"He may be beadle or drum-major, for anything I know or care,"
said Madame de Gimbecque with sublime contempt; "but I am convinced
that in the time of the elder branch he would never have
shaken the dust from his feet in the palace of the Tuileries. Ha!&mdash;a
critique on Claude's new play. Pray remind me, by and by, to send
to Monsieur de Bercy the note-case wadded with vitiver I have been
embroidering for him. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyons! 'Sophie de Melcour</i>, a drama in three
acts. We regret&mdash;a-hem!&mdash;feeble&mdash;diffuse&mdash;flat&mdash;a-hem!&mdash;dialogue
full of platitudes&mdash;characters full of exaggeration&mdash;style stilted&mdash;catastrophe
contemptible&mdash;false taste&mdash;corrupt morality.' (This must
have been written by some particular friend!) 'We cannot take
our leave of Monsieur de Bercy without counselling him to turn his
mind to some other branch of literary occupation than the stage, for
which the bent of his genius evidently disqualifies this pains-taking
but ill-judging young man.' Bah!&mdash;Eugène de Marsan's doing, I am
convinced! He knows I dote upon theatrical entertainments; he
knows that I bespoke half-a-dozen boxes to give <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> to Monsieur de
Bercy's piece, and thinks to disgust me by this disparagement. Eugène
does not know me; he does not appreciate the generosity of
woman's nature! His abuse of poor Claude's play has put me more
in conceit with it than ever. Certainly the style of 'Sophie de Melcour'
is rather stilted, and nobody can deny the exaggeration of the
characters. <em>I</em> expected that the catastrophe would cause the damnation
of the piece; and as to the dialogue, I could scarcely sit it
out without a yawn. Aglaé! on second thoughts, Monsieur de Marsan
is going out of town, and has been plaguing me for the last six
months for some little trifle of my own work. I will give <em>him</em> the
<em>vitiver</em> pocket-book: there will be plenty of time hereafter to get up
another for Monsieur de Bercy. People so devoted to letters have
no time to think of embroidered pocket-books. I dare say Bercy
would like one bought at the Petit Dunquerque twice as well. There
is no more sentiment in him than in one of his own farces."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Aglaé was of the same opinion. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Constitutionnel</i>
having decided that Claude's seventy-sixth vaudeville was not to run,
she decided that the author of the vaudeville was also at a stand-still.
The loss of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droits d'auteur</i>, which would probably deprive her of
the gold chain and cross promised by her lady's love, determined <em>his</em>
forfeiture of the embroidered note-case!</p>

<p>While the sacred mysteries of the toilet are proceeding in the bath-room,
let us take a peep at the equivocal gentleman of the third-floor;
no longer arrayed in velvet or sparkling with solitaires, but engirt in
a scanty, washed-out printed calico dressing-gown, torn in the button-holes,
and short enough to display at the open wristbands the sleeves
of a dirty checked shirt, covering a yellow shrivelled skin, apparently
washed out, like the calico. A pair of flannel drawers, yellow as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
arnotto, covered his shrunk shanks; a pair of old shoes, cut down into
agonizing slippers, his stockingless feet; while, enfranchised from the
spruce, lustrous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toupet</i> adorning his brows when exposed to day's or
gas-light's garish eye, his mean, narrow, Emperor-of-Austrian forehead
recedes into a bare crown, whose denuded ugliness adds thirty
years to the age of the full-dressed sallier-forth of the night before.
Even his mouth&mdash;that critical verifier of age&mdash;is strangely oldened;
for his set of <em>Desirabodes</em> is still freshening in a glass of water on the
chimney-piece, while the mumbling, toothless gums, fallen on each
other, allow the lanky sallow cheeks to collapse, like the sides of a
half-empty balloon.</p>

<p>Such was the unsophisticated man of the individual whose "getting-up"
(as Claude de Bercy would have called it) for public representation
was one of the miracles of the Palais Royal; a bazaar which, like the
pedlar from the fair Lavinian shore, hath "complexions in its pack,"
and youth and beauty per yard, per ell, or per ounce, exposed in all its
plate-glass windows. It was, as we have already stated, usually half-past
seven of an evening when the full-dressed effort of art started
forth along the Boulevards; it was as invariably three o'clock in the
morning, minus a quarter, when it returned again to lay aside its
adornments, and subside into the lean and slippered pantaloon. Ma'mselle
Berthe had been three hours snoring when, with a patent key,
he nightly let himself in, to deposit his <em>Desirabodes</em>, false fronts, whiskers,
and calves on his dressing-table; and in the secretaire beside it
realities of a more solid nature: bags of silver pieces, rouleaux of
golden ones, and now and then a flimsy I O U from some English
flat, or an I O U addressed by the Bank of England to millions of
English flats, which he rarely ensnugged within the secret-paper-drawer
of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonheur du jour</i> without pronouncing a benediction over
its senseless form, varying in intensity of expression, indeed, according
as the document happened to be accompanied by bags of silver
or rouleaux of gold. When wholly unaccompanied,&mdash;sole trophy of
his midnight gains,&mdash;the fiendish expression of the little mummy's
puckered visage deepened into downright demonism.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was the morning duty of the sour <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de confiance</i>
to summon the shattered remains of humanity, which she called
master, to breakfast. But let it not be inferred from the squalid nature
of his personal costume that the board of Monsieur Georges
was spread penuriously: his outward man regarded the gratification
of others; his inward regarded his own. The colour of his dressing-gown
tended not a jot to his selfish enjoyment; but the amber coffee
and smoking cream, the spongy bread and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">présalé</i> butter, the slices
of hard <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saucisson d'Arles</i> and tender <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">côtelettes à la minute</i> in their
silver <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réchaud</i>, regarded exclusively his own five senses. It was to
ensure to his daily use these sweeteners of human existence that the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevalier d'industrie</i> toiled in his loathsome calling from eight o'clock
to two per night; it was to ensure them hot and hot, and upon the
most moderate terms, that he bore with the angular and acid female
who presided over his domestic arrangements the remaining eighteen
hours of the twenty-four. A younger and fairer <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de ménage</i>
would have exacted a nicer toilet, and the daintiest half of the dainties
wherewith it was her duty to provide his table. But the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chissie</i>
not only calculated the weight of provisions to be consumed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
thirty-second fraction of an ounce, but was content to eat the drumsticks
of the chickens, the wings of the woodcocks, as well as to support
the unsightly spectacle of his bald head and nauseous costume.</p>

<p>"Of what were you disputing last night with the old witch, Madame
Grégoire, when I passed the porter's lodge?" demanded Monsieur
Georges of the perpendicular shrew seated opposite to him, as he
swallowed to his own share the twentieth of the two dozen oysters of
Murênes provided for their breakfast.</p>

<p>"I only stepped in to pay her the twenty francs for Guguste's
monthly board."</p>

<p>"But what was there in <em>that</em> to beget a squabble?" demanded the
toothless man, in the mumbling chuckle which nothing but long custom
enabled his housekeeper to understand. "Had she a complaint
to make against the lad?"</p>

<p>"No one has complaints to make of him but <em>you</em>," said Ma'mselle
Berthe, (forgetting her own venomous impeachment concerning the
coffee and cream.) "We disputed because Madame Grégoire, like
an ill-conditioned woman as she is, presumed to insult me."</p>

<p>"And what then?&mdash;you can make her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étrennes</i> pay for it."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> can: but what compensation will it be to <em>me</em> that you diminish
her New-year's gift from twenty francs to ten? She had the impudence
to ask me to have an eye to the people on the third-floor!
As if I was paid to do the spy-work of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">propriétaire</i>!"</p>

<p>"And who <em>are</em> the people on the third-floor?" demanded Monsieur
Georges, who knew and cared very little for the proceedings of any
house save the one under government licence in the Rue de Richelieu,
amid the blaze of whose Corcel lamps, and glare of whose gilded
cornices, he had the honour nightly to assist in fleecing the disloyal
subjects of Louis Philippe and the greenhorn foreign visitors to his
realms.</p>

<p>"How should I know?"</p>

<p>"Because Madame Grégoire, doubtless, informed you."</p>

<p>"She told me it was a lady and her daughter, about whom she
had her doubts."</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> doubts?&mdash;that they were disreputable people?"</p>

<p>"Bah!&mdash;that they were <em>beggars</em>!"</p>

<p>"Then why don't the landlord get rid of them?"</p>

<p>"How can he?&mdash;they pay their rent."</p>

<p>"Then what did she want you to find out?"</p>

<p>"How the young lady employs herself of a morning, and why the
mamma did not choose to receive the visits of that excellent man
Monsieur le Baron de Bonc&oelig;ur."</p>

<p>"Is the first-floor made a baron?"</p>

<p>"To be sure he is!&mdash;everybody is made something now-a-days.
If you had the spirit of a mouse, you would call yourself the Chevalier
de Georges."</p>

<p>"I <em>have</em> the spirit of a mouse, which is to 'ware trap!" chuckled
the dilapidated croupier. "I had a little adventure one season at
Bagnères de Bigorre, under the name of the Chevalier St. Georges,
which the police may not happen to have forgotten. But to return
to the banker: what can he have in view by visiting a couple of beggarly
women on a third-floor above the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entresol</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are as bad as Ma'me Grégoire! That is just what she inquired
of <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>"But though you mightn't choose to acquaint <em>her</em> with what had
come to your knowledge&mdash;Hark! a ring at the bell," cried Monsieur
Georges, interrupting himself as he shuffled out of his seat, and prepared
to retreat into his adjoining chamber. "If 'tis any one for
me, say I'm gone out, and shan't be at home till evening."</p>

<p>"Don't flurry yourself," replied the housekeeper, moving towards
the ante-room; "'tis only Guguste, come up to varnish your boots
and bring your <em>toupet</em> from the barber's. Don't you hear him scratching
the panel? That is the signal by which I know his ring from
any other person's."</p>

<p>And no sooner had she charily opened the door, and prepared to
lock it again after admitting him, than the quick-witted <em>gamin</em>, in his
fustian blouse, and barret-cap, though thread-bare, set jauntily on
one side, insinuated himself into the hated apartment.</p>

<p>"What makes you so late, sirrah?" demanded the mummy in the
washed-out calico dressing-gown, grudging the foundling even the
savoury steam of the viands that still circled in the eating-room.</p>

<p>"'Tis only half-after eleven, sir," replied the drudge. "You desired
there might be no noise in the apartment till half-after eleven."</p>

<p>"'Tis three minutes after the half-hour."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle does not choose me to come in, till breakfast is
cleared away, and the things ready to be washed up," said Guguste,
not caring to hear.</p>

<p>"In that case you have no right to be here now. But you know
my orders, that you are to enter this room with my dressing things
every day at half-past eleven. Where have you been idling for the
last three minutes?"</p>

<p>"I have not been idling."</p>

<p>"Where have you been working, then?"</p>

<p>"Helping to put up a truckle-bed in Madame Grégoire's back-room.
Her son Jules returned at five o'clock this morning from
India."</p>

<p>"From India, child?" demanded the gouvernante, peeling the only
slice of saucisson left in the dish, and insinuating it between lips as
thin as itself.</p>

<p>"From Algiers in the Indies. Monsieur Jules serves in the
twenty-third regiment of the line; and, having suffered considerably
from the climate, has obtained his furlough."</p>

<p>"Another lazy useless hanger-on in the house! God help us!"
ejaculated the housekeeper. "There, go and arrange your master's
things in his dressing-room, while I put away breakfast. I will leave
the china for you to wash up, outside the kitchen-door. Go!"</p>

<p>And he went,&mdash;neither whistling, however, nor with any want of
thought. Between his discoveries concerning the Courson family,
and the wonderful events he had just heard recited in the metaphorical
military prose of Monsieur Jules, (<em>alias</em> the slang of the twenty-third
regiment of the line,) Guguste had a forty-horse power of
cogitation at that moment labouring in his brain!</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="THE_LAST_OF_THE_BANDITS" id="THE_LAST_OF_THE_BANDITS"></a>THE LAST OF THE BANDITS.</h2>


<p>I much admired, and have often thought of, two pictures of Horace
Verney's, which I saw in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Exposition des Tableaux</i>, of I forget what
year, at Paris; in truth to nature, in conception and character, they
leave nothing to desire. They were painted at Rome; and represent,
one, the attack of brigands,&mdash;and the other, the death and confession
of the captain of the gang after their falling into the hands
of the dragoons.</p>

<p>Much has been written, too, on the subject of these outcasts of society;
but no description of their manner of life and habits can compare
with Washington Irving's "Painter's Story," or rather Charles de
Chatillon's own adventures, when carried off from Lucien Bonaparte's
villa at Frescati, in mistake for that prince.</p>

<p>The times are grown degenerate; brigandage is no longer a profession;
bandits, like the Mohicans, are become extinct, and from
Terracina to Forli, travellers have now-a-days no chance of meeting
with a Paolo Ucelli, a Fiesole Ogagna, a De Cesaris, or a Barbone. I
remember traversing that tract at a period when I expected every moment
to see some of these freebooters in their picturesque costume
peep from behind every projecting rock. Civilization and morality
have stifled all sentiment;&mdash;the Neapolitan frontier is become a
Salvator Rosa without its figures.</p>

<p>When I landed at Cività Vecchia from the steamer, I inquired
of the landlord of the inn whether the redoubtable Barbone was still
an inmate of the fortress; and, on his answering in the affirmative,
obtained an order to visit the place. Under the escort of one of the
Pope's carabiniers, behold me then in the shadow of that colossal
edifice!</p>

<p>It was built by Michael Angelo, and, like all his works, whether in
architecture, statuary, or painting, is stamped with the grandeur of
his genius. Its stupendous bastions, its ponderous gateway, seem
built for eternity. Every stone is a rock such as Briareus and his
earth-born brothers might have hurled against Jupiter, in that Titanic
war described with such sublime obscurity by Hesiod.</p>

<p>The gendarme was, as is common to all the tribe of cicerones,
talkative&mdash;not respecting the building, for he had never heard of the
great architect, but concerning its then inhabitants. He would, if I
had listened to him, have recounted the particulars of Signor Barbone's
exploits during the seventeen years that he ravaged like a pestilence
the Pontifical states. But I expected to obtain information
from the fountain-head, and checked his loquacity.</p>

<p>Our hero had, twice before his present captivity, made terms with
the Papal government. Once he was placed with Marocco and Garbarone,
two worthy confreres, in the seminary of Terracina; and, just
as the priests began to consider him an example of contrition and
penitence, bore off the youths into the mountains, where this wolf of
the fold barbarously murdered all those whose fathers would not, or
could not, pay the exorbitant ransom demanded.</p>

<p>One only of the prisoners escaped the proscription, and the circumstance
is a curious one. They were bound two and two, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
after great privations and fatigues,&mdash;for they were dragged into fastnesses
almost inaccessible,&mdash;an order was given for their execution.
One had already fallen by the stiletto, when his companion invoked
Sant' Antonio, the patron saint of brigands, and that name saved him.
It is a hint worth knowing. Should any future Barbone arise, remember
to call upon Saint Anthony!</p>

<p>Barbone afterwards became keeper of the château of St. Angelo,
the great prison at Rome; but quickly relapsed into his old practices,
the last of which exceeded in ferocity the rest.</p>

<p>Not far from Forli, an Englishman of distinction, whose name I
will not mention, was stopped on his way to Rome. They plundered
the father, and carried off the daughter. On reaching his destination
he put a price on Barbone's head; but one morning a box arrived,
which, instead of his, contained that of the daughter!</p>

<p>The revolting recollection of this ruffian's cruelty made me pause
as I stood in the portal and thought of that of the Inferno, for which
it would have been no bad model; and thought, too, of the giants who
guarded it, whose arms, as they wildly brandished them, looked in
the distance like the vans of windmills (the original, by the by, of
Cervantes'). They would have been in excellent keeping with the
place. For a moment, I say, I hesitated about entering; but curiosity
got the better of terror, and I resolved to visit the Bagno, a
name which in the month of August it well merited.</p>

<p>In the court-yard were walking several of the brigands who belonged
to their monarch's train,&mdash;his satellites; but I did not stop to
address them. I desired my conductor to show me to the head-quarters
of the general, in the interior of the prison.</p>

<p>I found there a great many cells or holes, not unresembling dog-kennels,
arched and formed in the massive walls; and, among the rest,
the den of the Cacus. He was lying at full length on the floor,
which might be eight or ten feet in length; and behind him, almost
hid in shade, was crouching another brigand, leaning on his elbows,
and stooping low. He was taking his siesta. This bandit was, I
afterwards found, Barbone's prime-minister. They were inseparable&mdash;the
tiger and his jackal, or rather, perhaps, wolf.</p>

<p>Barbone raised himself on one arm at my approach, and eyed me
with all the hauteur of a prince. He was dressed like the rest, in
the usual uniform,&mdash;cap, jacket, and coarse trowsers. He by no
means corresponded in appearance with one of Horace Verney's
brigands. He was a man of a middle height, corpulent in his person,
with a countenance that showed no trace of crime: his features were
handsome and regular; and his hair, long, black, and curly, hung over
his shoulders. He certainly set all Lavater's theories at defiance.
As to his head, I leave that to the phrenologists.</p>

<p>He seemed little inclined to enter into conversation; and, fettered
as he was, I should have felt as little disposed to trust myself in his
den as in that of a bloodhound. However, perceiving that I did not
go away, and stood at the entrance, he at last had the courtesy to
come forth. I, too, was inclined to address him civilly, with the
hope of knowing something of his history and character; so I said to
him,</p>

<p>"You are the famous Barbone, of whom I have heard so much,
and long wished to see?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gasparoni, a servirlo</i>," said he.</p>

<p>The reply made me smile, for I doubted not he would have served
me, if set at liberty, in his own peculiar way.</p>

<p>"You smile," said he; "perhaps you are come to mock me?" He
folded his arms, and looked at me sternly.</p>

<p>"I had no such intention," I replied. "You call yourself Gasparoni.
I thought your name had been Barbone?"</p>

<p>"So they styled me," he answered, "from the long beard which I
formerly wore."</p>

<p>"Pray may I ask you how you happened to be taken?" I observed
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Preso!</i>" said he contemptuously; "I was never taken. Not all
the troops in the Pontifical states could have taken me. None but
eagles could have reached our resorts. There we wanted for nothing,
besiege us as they might. The peasants were our friends, and
brought us plenty of provisions. We annihilated party after party
that they sent against us, till the soldiers would fight no longer.
Many of them entered our band, which at one time consisted of nearly
one hundred. But I got tired of that savage life. In the summer
months it was well enough; but to brave the winter among the
mountains,&mdash;to sleep on the snows with nothing but our mantles to
shelter us,&mdash;to be deprived of our wives and children,&mdash;not to be
able to dispose of our booty without great risk, so that even money
was often of no use to us! I could point out where many a napoleon
and doppia d'oro is buried. And yet," said he after a pause, "that
life, with all its privations and miseries, is preferable to confinement
in a prison. Oh! you cannot fancy what the want of liberty is to
us mountaineers!&mdash;to rot in a dungeon,&mdash;not to have the free use of
our limbs!" Here he clanked his chains.</p>

<p>After this harangue, which he delivered with great volubility, he
folded his arms again, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Napoleon</i>, and a gloom came over him.
He seemed to be lost in thought.</p>

<p>"You have said," I observed, "that you were never taken. How
then came you here?"</p>

<p>"Here!" he said with emphasis; "I was trepanned&mdash;betrayed!
The Pope broke his faith; my confessor, his sacred word. I was
promised pardon,&mdash;full pardon for myself and my brave brothers. We
were betrayed&mdash;sold; and yet we live in hopes that the holy father
will redeem his promise."</p>

<p>"Yes," thought I; "if he <em>had</em> done you justice, you would not be
here."</p>

<p>"Your name," I said flatteringly, "is well known in Europe. You
are the Napoleon of bandits, and worthy of being classed with De
Cesaris."</p>

<p>"De Cesaris," said he contemptuously, "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">era un miserabile!</i> He
took a poor painter for a prince. Ha! ha! Gasparoni would not
have made such a blunder." Here he laughed again with a consciousness
of superiority. "The fool, too," said he, "to allow the
artist to paint his portrait!&mdash;it was like a man's putting his name on
a stiletto, and leaving it as evidence against himself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, "like him, you have no objection to the world's
knowing something of your story. Charles de Chatillon has immortalized
him; he is become an historical character."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no such ambition," said he. "It matters little what the
world thinks of me; but you shall have my history, if you have any
curiosity to know it."</p>

<p>"The greatest," I replied.</p>

<p>"It is a short one," observed the bandit.</p>

<p>"I am the son of Rinalda, better known in the Roman annals than
I am. She was cruelly injured. Deprived of her lover, Peronti,
whom they made a priest, she took a hatred to all mankind&mdash;a just
one, and taught me to revenge her wrongs on the whole human
species; brought me up to brigandage as a profession,&mdash;and as good a
one as any other, and as honourable! I went very early into the
mountains, and joined a band of brave fellows, which, on the death of
their captain, I was unanimously chosen to command. Chosen from
my merit, I governed them by opinion. They knew that I was brave
and prudent. I had many times an opportunity of showing that I
had all the qualities that constitute a good general: had I commanded
an army, like Napoleon, I should have been as invincible. Once we
were besieged in the upper ranges of the Abruzzi by a company of
Austrians, at the time those <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">maledetti tyranni d'Italia</i> had possession
of Naples. We were enclosed on three sides by the troops, and on
the other was a precipice of many hundred feet, that plunged, without
a shelf or ledge of rock, into the plain. I was at that time detached
with nine of my companions; but such was the nature of the
crag on which we bivouacked,&mdash;so narrow the access to it, that only
one person could mount the pass at a time. This our enemies knew,
for they lost several men in making a reconnaissance. But our provisions
failed us, and we were on the point of giving ourselves up, for
fear of starvation, when I discovered an eagle's eyrie, and, to the
wonder of our foes, contrived, by plundering it of hares and kids, to
support nature for many days. At last the eaglets flew; and then
our distress returned, and with it the thought of surrender.</p>

<p>"I recollected, however, that opposite to where a single sentinel
had been posted there was a chasm&mdash;a fissure&mdash;a deep ravine, the
top of which was covered with wood; and one dark night, leading
my little band, I crawled on hands and knees without being perceived,
and poniarded the vidette:&mdash;he fell without a groan! We
then, after overcoming incredible dangers, reached the brink of the
abyss. My troop eyed the gulph with terror. It was narrow; but
at the bottom roared a mountain torrent, that from its immeasurable
depth looked like a silver thread. I came provided with a rope, to
which, when we dare not go down into the plain, we are in the habit
of attaching a basket, which we lower to the peasants for provisions;
to this rope I adjusted a heavy dagger, and hurled it across the
chasm. By good fortune, it got entangled at the first throw among
the brushwood, and stuck fast between two of the branches. Having
drawn it tight, I fastened it to a tree on our side of the ravine. My
companions watched me with anxiety, wondering what next I was
about to do. I spoke not a word, but suspended myself over the
abyss; and, hand over hand, reached the opposite bank in safety. All
followed me, and with like success, save one, whose strength or courage
failed him: he unhappily sunk into the boiling gulph, but he was
dead long before he reached it; so that his sufferings were less than
had he been taken by the Tedeschi. What a supper we made that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
night! and how soundly we slept! That night&mdash;that sleep repaid
all our toils!</p>

<p>"Great was the astonishment of our foes when they found we had
escaped their snares; and you may by that escape form some notion
of the pleasures of a brigand's life.</p>

<p>"But this was not the only time we were near falling into the
power of the soldiery. In all my seventeen years of service we were
never betrayed but once. You know that one of the great trades in
our mountains is that of Carbonari. The wood is of no value but to
make charcoal, which principally goes into the markets of Rome and
Naples. We always kept on good terms with these gentry. One
night we were incautiously&mdash;contrary to our usual practice&mdash;drinking
with them, without having placed a single sentinel, when we found
ourselves attacked by an armed party,&mdash;not, however, before I
heard their arms rattling in the branches; so that we had time to
seize our muskets. They were much more numerous than ourselves,
but they paid dear for their attack: I killed four with my own hand.
I was wounded; but that is nothing&mdash;I am full of wounds: look here,
and here, and here! The Carbonari fled; but we surprised them
afterwards. Who can escape from those intent on revenge!&mdash;a time
always comes, or soon or late. So with them. We retaliated&mdash;terribly
retaliated; not a man escaped! Not that I lifted a hand against
them,&mdash;none ever fell by Gasparoni but in action."</p>

<p>As he said this, his stature seemed to grow; and it was clear that
he thought himself a hero. He waited, expecting, no doubt, that I
should express my admiration of his exploits; but I remembered the
last, and said to him,</p>

<p>"You forget the daughter of the Englishman&mdash;her head&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Questo Inglese era un impertinente</i>," replied he. "Why did he
not send the ransom? He knew, or ought to have known, the laws
of brigands; we could not have spared her life had we wished it.
No; it would have been an act of injustice&mdash;of gross partiality."</p>

<p>Here some of the brigands, who had heard his words, came up,
and by their gestures gave confirmation of their general's words.</p>

<p>"And who among the band," I inquired, "was the executioner;
for, like Louis XI, I suppose you had your Tristan?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the back of the cave, and called Geronymo, the
figure whom I had first observed. He came forward.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Son quì!</i>" said the man with a hoarse guttural voice, that might
have been mistaken for the howl of a wolf.</p>

<p>I looked at him attentively, and not without a sense of horror and
disgust. His long and bony, yet athletic form, might have served as
a model for a gladiator, for the muscles protruded like one of Michael
Angelo's anatomical figures: his cadaverous sallow countenance
pale with crime,&mdash;his eyes deep sunk, and overhung by thick
bushy eyebrows, and emitting a gloomy light as within caverns,&mdash;his
thin and straight upper lip, with the lower underhung like that
of a dog-fish, fitted him well for the bourreau of Signor Gasparoni.</p>

<p>"So you were the executioner of the Englishman's daughter, Geronymo,
eh?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Si, signor</i>," said he, with a grin of satisfaction, that betrayed a
pride of office, and a superiority over his fellows.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Era molto bella!</i>" observed one of the bandits behind me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked over my shoulder. The wretch who spoke was a little
corpulent man, and reminded me of one of Rubens' satyrs. There
was a most revolting leer on his countenance, which suggested to
my mind not her death,&mdash;which was a mercy,&mdash;but the miserable
fate that preceded it. I remembered the story of the peasant girl in
the Tales of a Traveller, and shuddered.</p>

<p>Turning round again to that iron-visaged wretch, Geronymo, I said
to him,</p>

<p>"Have you no remorse, Geronymo, for all the murders you have
committed?"</p>

<p>"Remorse!" he replied, as though he did not understand the meaning
of the word: "ought not a good soldier to obey the word of command?
Whenever the captain said '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Amazza!</i>' <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">amazzava</i>."</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Avete amazzato molte?</i>" I asked.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Si, signor, moltissime</i>," he replied, with the greatest nonchalance.
His eye lighted up, as he spoke, with a gloomy joy.</p>

<p>I turned from him as from a basilisk, and almost thought I heard
the death-rattle of one of his victims.</p>

<p>As I was about to leave the Bagno, I met a capuchin, their confessor.
It was the same who had persuaded Gasparoni to deliver
himself up to the Roman authorities. I took him aside, and entered
into conversation with him. He was a man advanced in age, and of
a physiognomy such as I have observed to be common to almost all
ecclesiastics in Italy,&mdash;heavy, dull, and unmeaning. He told me that
Gasparoni and most of his band were very religious, and went regularly
to mass and confession. He added, that he had petitioned the
holy father for their liberation, and that he had no doubt, if released,
that they would now make good subjects.</p>

<p>"The Pope," I observed, "knows them too well by past experience
to trust such wretches at large again."</p>

<p>What tales might not this man reveal! but I found he was disinclined
to be communicative, and in a hurry to commence his duties.
I wished him therefore a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">buon giorno</i>.</p>

<p>When we have voluntarily shut ourselves up in a Bagno with its
unhappy inmates, it seems as though the return to liberty was interdicted
to us,&mdash;that we are the victims to some snare, and that the iron
gates of the prison are actually closed on us for ever. But a moment's
reflection dissipates the fearful illusion, and we abandon ourselves, as
Lucretius describes those who behold a storm at a distance, to the
pleasure derived from our own security; or as we do when leaning
over the parapet of a precipice. But, at the same time, I rushed
through the open doors like a captive on being delivered from his
chains, and, having emerged from the gloomy gateway, breathed more
freely, inhaled with a new delight the sea-breeze, and stood watching
the sun sink slowly through the vaporous atmosphere till it had totally
disappeared below the waters. Then I returned to my inn,
reflecting that I had perhaps just seen the last of the bandits. And
yet the scene I had witnessed left no impression behind it such as I
had expected; it furnished no stores to feed the imagination or to
awaken the enthusiasm of art. The poetry of banditism has perished
in the citadel of Cività Vecchia.</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><h2 class="space-above2"><a name="THE_GLORIES_OF_GOOD_HUMOUR" id="THE_GLORIES_OF_GOOD_HUMOUR"></a>THE GLORIES OF GOOD HUMOUR.</h2>

<p class="center f90 b space-below2">BY GODFREY GOODFELLOW.</p>

<p class="linequot">"Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit æquus."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hor.</span></p>


<p>What a charming thing good humour is! How superexcellent and
inestimable a quality, or character, or attribute of the mind! Yes, I
unhesitatingly declare there is nothing like it. It is the only true
key to the casket of happiness, the real source of all this world's enjoyments,
the potent mithridate of misery, the balm of life, the care-dispelling
Nepenthe, the rich restoring heavenly elixir drawn by wisdom
from the alembic of content.</p>

<p>The good-humoured man is the only true philosopher. He alone
knows how to enjoy life. He is wiser far than all the grave <em>Saturnine</em>
star-gazers and moralists in the world. Is he not? Why, of what use
is all our philosophy if it does not enable a man to be merry and live
happy? Psha! to give way to grief, to allow the mind to succumb
to despondency, is certainly to exhibit our poor humanity in one of
the most ridiculous positions in which it could be placed. Diogenes,
domiciled in a tub, cuts rather a curious figure amidst the sages of
antiquity; and so do a host of others: but, certainly, Heraclitus in
tears exhibits the weakness of human nature more glaringly than any
of them. Grieving, forsooth! Why, 'tis just as if a man, plunging
into the sea, should tie a stone about his neck in order to enable him
to swim the better. Grieving is indeed a bad sort of a safety-jacket
in a "sea of troubles." No: give me the good-humoured man; the
fine, gay, jovial fellow, whom no disasters can depress; the true minion
of merriment and fun, whom no sorrows can sadden; the genuine
votary of "heart-easing mirth," whose mind, like the lark at sunrise,
is ever cheerful and gay;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Whose wit can brighten up a winter's day,</div>
<div class="verse">And chase the splenetic dull hours away."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Give me such a man; his philosophy is worth all the dogmas, and
rules, and precepts, that ever were expounded in the Academe, the
Porch, or the Lycæum.</p>

<p>What should I be now&mdash;or, rather, <em>where</em> should I be&mdash;but for my
good humour? Alas! perhaps sailing the Styx in company with Charon;
or, not having the ferry money, wandering disconsolate upon the
banks, (for it is only the good-humoured, such as Menippus, that can
manage to get over passage-free.) But here I am now, a fine, fat,
rubicund fellow,&mdash;and all, I say it unhesitatingly, owing to my good
humour. Good humour, thou hast indeed been to me a true, and
kind, and trusty benefactress! Oh! thou fair, and sweet, and lovely
thing, in whatever form thou holdest communion with mortals: whether
thou art an immaterial essence that blends at will with our mortal
bodies or whether thou art something more loving and palpable,&mdash;that
light, blithe, blue-eyed maid,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Whom lovely Venus at a birth,</div>
<div class="verse">With two sister graces more,</div>
<div class="verse">To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;"</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span></p>
<p>or whether a wild spirit, a lovely Ariel of the air, thou transfusest
thyself into all the beautiful things of this world,&mdash;the green fields,
and the silvery streams, and the sunny skies,&mdash;and then, rich with
the sheen of their loveliness, comest into the presence-chamber of the
mind, fixest thyself in the great senate of the senses, cheering and
gladdening all their emotions!&mdash;whatever thou art, good humour,&mdash;be
thou a bodiless essence, a lovely maid, a lively spirit, or any other
modification of the mysterious and the beautiful, I love thee; love
thee as dearly as ever Orpheus loved his Eurydice, Petrarch his
Laura, or Waller his Sacharissa. Thou art the harbinger of comfort,
the inductress of joy, the dove that bringest to mortals the olive of
happiness and peace. Without thee what were life?&mdash;a dull, dreary,
uninteresting scene,&mdash;a bare, bleak, barren, joyless, empyreanless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Stop&mdash;stop&mdash;stop&mdash;stop!&mdash;halloo, Pegasus! where the devil are
you going to? Soho! softly; not quite so high if you please; much
as you admire good humour, do, pray! stay a little nearer to the confines
of this "visible diurnal sphere."</p>

<p>"Who are you? where do you come from? You have no right
to be dealing out such fulsome panegyrics about good humour."</p>

<p>Yes, but I have, though; I am universally acknowledged to be
the most good-humoured man on town. The pure blood of the Allwits,
the Easymirths, and the Goodfellows, flows in my veins. I am
heir to a large property in Merryland, and my residence is at Jollity
Hall, a picturesque, romantic spot in the county of Greatlaughtershire.
I intend to start at the next general election for the borough
of Gaybright; when I shall bring in such a measure of reform
as shall astonish all our modern menders of constitutions.</p>

<p>I have every right, then, to descant upon the merits of good humour;
and I do so the rather because men do not sufficiently appreciate
them.</p>

<p>Now I fully agree with Dr. Johnson in thinking that "good humour
is the quality to which everything in this life owes its power of pleasing."
It is the one great source from which spring all those innumerable
streams of enjoyment that intersect, and refresh, and beautify
the social and moral world. It is, like Fame, "the spur that the clear
spirit doth raise" above the fogs, and the damps, and the vapours
that so often hang over and darken this sublunary scene. It is the
grand moral alkali that completely neutralizes the corrosive acerbity
of all this world's cares and sorrows. It is a pure heavenly sunshine
illumining the chambers of the soul; a coal from heaven's own golden
hearth, that warms into a congenial and ever-during glow all the best
and kindliest emotions of our nature.</p>

<p>How different, indeed, would be the condition of the world if a system
of good humour were universally established! For what is it
but the absence of good humour that is the cause of almost all the
troubles of life? All the wars that have desolated the world spring
from no other origin. Kings and rulers wanting good humour have
fallen out, and whole nations have been set at loggerheads:</p>

<p class="linequot">"Quicquid delirant reges plectuntur Achivi."</p>

<p>Now, if good humour universally influenced the actions of men, there
would be none of these things; war would be at an end. General Evans
might then attend to his parliamentary duties. The "mailed Mars"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
might "on his altar sit," but it would not be "up to the ears in blood."
He might lay by his lance, and commence smoking the calumet of
peace. Again, we should have no need of that noisy, brawling, troublesome
class of men yclept lawyers,&mdash;for it is plainly from the absence
of good humour that all the litigation in the world takes its rise. The
gentlemen of the long robe might then leave <em>silk gowns</em> to their ladies,
and transfer their pleading to some other court than a court of law.
At all events, the world would be freed from their forensic displays,
for men would be on such <em>good terms</em> with each other that there
would be no need of <em>law terms</em> to set them right. And also, under a
general system of good humour, we should be freed from all the turmoil
and contention of politics. Tithes, and church-rates, and corporation
bills, would no longer afford such scope for violent and angry
declamation. Would not this be glorious? As for our physicians,
they might shut up shop, for there is no such admirable conservative
of the constitution as good humour,&mdash;it being generally admitted that
all diseases take their rise from the prevalence of <em>bad</em> humour in the
blood. These disciples of Galen, then,&mdash;these knights of the lancet,&mdash;might
become philosophers, and study physics instead of physic; or
they might devote themselves to analyse the faculties of the mind,
and thus, instead of physicians, become metaphysicians.</p>

<p>But, indeed, the ramifications are so numerous, that it would not be
easy to follow out and describe all the innumerable advantages that
would result from the establishment of an universal system of good
humour.</p>

<p>And thus we are enabled at once to explain what the poets have
meant by the Golden Age. It was plainly nothing else than the
reign of universal good humour. The proof is quite obvious. Gold
is the most excellent of metals,&mdash;good humour is the most excellent
of the qualities of the mind; and therefore, the analogy being so
striking, the poets at once styled this happy period the Golden Age.
And hence it is evident that good humour is the only true philosopher's
stone.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"This is the charm by sages often told,</div>
<div class="verse">Converting all it touches into gold.</div>
<div class="verse">Content can soothe, where'er by Fortune placed:</div>
<div class="verse">Can rear a garden in the desert waste."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this passage "content" is only another name for good humour.
Cease, then, ye followers of the Hermetic art, cease toiling over your
crucibles; good humour is the true moral alchemy that will really
enrich and ameliorate mankind.</p>

<p>This, then, is the reform bill which I intend to introduce as soon
as I have the honour of a seat in the house; a bill for striking
out, arranging, devising, and establishing some plan by which good
humour may be reduced to a system; so that henceforward it will
be the cardinal principle of life,&mdash;the rule by which all the actions of
men shall be guided, regulated, and directed. Let me but pass this;
and then, my country! thy happiness is secured. Let us hear no
more about the ballot, and universal suffrage, and all those Utopian
schemes of our modern speculators. Let us have no more hunting
after a visionary political optimism; good humour is the only one
thing necessary to bring all our civil institutions to a state of
complete perfection. "Give me," said Archimedes, "a point in extra-mundane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
space, and I will remove the solid earth from its foundations."
"Give me," say I, "good humour, and I will uproot all miseries,
and contentions, and quarrellings from the world." Away with
all the nostrums of our moralists and philosophers!&mdash;good humour is
the one sole, infallible panacea for all the ills of life. Misfortunes may
lower, and disappointments may assail; but still the mind of the good-humoured
man, like a Delos emerging from the deep, rises buoyant
above them all. Hurrah, then, for an eternal, cloudless, bright, jovial,
unsubduable good humour! Let us have nothing but good humour!
Let a cheerful smile be for ever playing upon the happy faces
of our lovely wives; let our children be born in good humour, and
in good humour let them grow up; let the girls be taught to smile
with their mother's smile, and the boys after the manner of their father;
and thus we shall be taking the best way to establish and consolidate
one vast, wide, universal empire of love, happiness, and joy!</p>

EIGHTY YEARS AGO.</h2>

<p class="center f90">EARL FERRERS.</p>


<p>The sensation created in London by that which has now become
no ordinary spectacle,&mdash;two public executions in the course of the last
few months,&mdash;naturally leads the observant mind to contemplate the
march of intellect in this great metropolis with respect to the
shedding of human blood by judicial authority. It may be interesting
to the general reader to lay before him the reflections thus suggested,
together with some curious and minute descriptions of scenes
witnessed within the last century.</p>

<p>The practice of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sus per Col</i>, as described in legal abbreviations, or
hanging, is the only mode of putting to death ("pressing to death"
excepted) known to the law of England for all felonies short of high
or petty treason. In cases of conspiracy against the state, traitors
of rank were indulged with the privilege of being beheaded; but
meaner offenders, besides other inflictions, were to suffer on the
gallows. This distinction necessarily caused the punishment to be
regarded as very ungenteel, if an expression of levity may be allowed;
and, in consequence, no respectable person, or, at any rate,
only here and there one, would choose to be hanged. Earl Ferrers,
who was convicted of the murder of his steward in the reign of
George the Second, petitioned that he might die by the axe. This
was refused. "He has done," said the old king, "de act of de bad
man, and he shall die de death of de bad man." The feeling of the
monarch was good, but it was rather odd that a king should seem
to think the punishment of treason, called by judges "the highest
crime known to the law," an ennobling indulgence which ought not
to be extended to a simple murderer.</p>

<p>One luxury, however, Lord Ferrers is reported to have secured for
the last hour of his life,&mdash;a silken rope; but a more important deviation
from the common mode, so far as abridgement of bodily pain
is concerned, was made on that occasion, for then it was that
what is now familiarly called the "drop" was first used. Till that
period, to draw a cart from beneath the culprit, or to throw him from
a ladder, by turning it round, after he had ascended to a certain
height for the halter to be adjusted, had been the practice; but for
the wretched peer a scaffold was prepared, part of the floor of which
was raised eighteen inches above the rest, which, on the signal of
death being given, became flat. The contrivance, however, did not
very well succeed, according to the narrative left us by Lord Orford;
which, from the remarkable circumstances it details of that memorable
exit, and of the usages which then prevailed, is worth
transcribing.</p>

<p>The crime for which the nobleman suffered was a most cruel murder.
He had been through life a very depraved character. It was doubted
if this were the only homicide he had committed; he had separated
from his wife, and ill-used his mistress. He, however, met his fate
with great firmness. "On the last morning," says Lord Orford
in a letter, "he dressed himself in his wedding clothes, and said
he thought this, at least, as good an occasion for putting them
on, as that for which they were first made." The account proceeds:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
"Even an awful procession of above two hours, with that
mixture of pageantry, shame, and ignominy, nay, and of delay, could
not dismount his resolution. He set out from the Tower at nine,
amidst thousands of spectators. First went a string of constables;
then one of the sheriffs, in his chariot and six, the horses dressed
with ribands; next, Lord Ferrers, in his own landau and six, his
coachman crying all the way,&mdash;guards at each side; the other sheriff's
chariot followed empty, with a mourning coach and six, a hearse, and
the Horse-guards. Observe, that the empty chariot was that of the
other sheriff, who was in the coach with the prisoner, and who was
Vaillant the French bookseller in the Strand. How (exclaims Lord
Orford to his correspondent) will you decypher all these strange
circumstances? A bookseller, in robes and in mourning, sitting as a
magistrate by the side of the earl; and, in the evening, everybody
going to Vaillant's shop to hear the particulars. I wrote to him, as
he serves me, for the account; but he intends to print it. Lord
Ferrers, at first, talked on indifferent matters; and, observing the
prodigious confluence of people, (the blind was drawn up on his side,)
he remarked, 'they never saw a lord hanged, and perhaps will never
see another,' One of the dragoons was thrown, by his horse's leg
entangling in the hind wheel: Lord Ferrers expressed much concern,
and said, 'I hope there will be no death to-day but mine;' and was
pleased when Vaillant told him the man was not hurt. Vaillant
made excuses to him for performing the duties of his office in person.
'For that,' said the earl, 'I am much obliged to you: I feared the
disagreeableness of the duty might make you depute your under-sheriff.
As you are so good as to execute it yourself, I am persuaded
the dreadful business will be conducted with more expedition.' The
Chaplain of the Tower, who sat backwards, then thought it his turn
to speak, and began to talk on religion; but Lord Ferrers received
it impatiently. However, the chaplain persevered; and said, he
wished to bring his lordship to some confession, or acknowledgment
of contrition, for a crime so repugnant to the laws of God and man,
and wished him to endeavour to do whatever could be done in so
short a time. The earl replied, 'he had done everything he proposed
to do, with regard to God and man; and, as to discourses on religion,
you and I, sir,' said he to the clergyman, 'shall probably not
agree on that subject. The passage is very short; you will not have
time to convince me, nor I to refute you; it cannot be ended before
we arrive.' The clergyman still insisted, and urged that, at least,
the world would expect some satisfaction. Lord Ferrers replied,
with some impatience, 'Sir, what have I to do with the world? I
am going to pay a forfeit life, which my country has thought proper
to take from me; what do I care now what the world thinks of me?
But, sir, since you do desire some confession, I will confess one thing
to you; I do believe there is a God. As to modes of worship,
we had better not talk on them. I always thought Lord Bolingbroke
in the wrong to publish his notions on religion: I will not fall into
the same error.' The chaplain, seeing that it was in vain to make
any more attempts, contented himself with representing to him, that
it would be expected from one of his calling, and that even decency
required, that some prayer should be used on the scaffold, and asked
his leave, at least, to repeat the Lord's Prayer there. Lord Ferrers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
replied, 'I always thought it a good prayer; you may use it if you
please.'</p>

<p>"While these speeches were passing, the procession was stopped by
the crowd. The earl said he was dry, and wished for some wine-and-water.
The sheriff said, he was sorry to be obliged to refuse him.
By late regulations they were enjoined not to let prisoners drink on
their way from the place of imprisonment to that of execution, as great
indecencies had been formerly committed by the lower species of criminals
getting drunk; 'and though,' said he, 'my lord, I might
think myself excusable in overlooking this order, out of regard to a
person of your lordship's rank, yet there is another reason, which I
am sure will weigh with you,&mdash;your lordship is sensible of the greatness
of the crowd: we must draw up to some tavern; the confluence
would be so great, that it would delay the expedition which your
lordship seems so much to desire.' He replied he was satisfied,
adding, 'Then I must be content with this;' and he took some pigtail
tobacco out of his pocket. As they went on, a letter was thrown
into his coach; it was from his mistress, to tell him that it was impossible,
from the crowd, for her to get round to the spot where he
had appointed her to meet and take leave of him, but that she was
in a hackney-coach of such a number. He begged Vaillant to order
his officers to try to get the hackney-coach up to his. 'My lord,'
said Vaillant, 'you have behaved so well hitherto, that I think it is
pity to venture unmanning yourself,' He was struck, and was satisfied
without seeing her. As they drew nigh, he said, 'I perceive
we are almost arrived: it is time to do what little more I have to
do; and then, taking out his watch, gave it to Vaillant, desiring him
to accept it as a mark of his gratitude for his kind behaviour; adding,
'It is scarce worth your acceptance, but I have nothing else; it is a
stopwatch, and a pretty accurate one.' He gave five guineas to the
chaplain, and took out as much for the executioner. Then giving
Vaillant a pocket-book, he begged him to deliver it to Mrs. Clifford,
his mistress, with what it contained, and with his most tender regards;
saying, 'The key of it is to the watch, but I am persuaded
you are too much a gentleman to open it' He destined the remainder
of the money in his purse to the same person, and with the same
tender regards.</p>

<p>"When they came to Tyburn, his coach was detained some minutes
by the conflux of people; but, as soon as the door was opened,
he stepped out readily, and mounted the scaffold. It was hung with
black by the undertaker, and at the expense of his family. Under
the gallows was a new-invented stage, to be struck from under him.
He showed no kind of fear or discomposure, only just looking at the
gallows with a slight motion of dissatisfaction. He said little,
kneeled for a moment to the prayer, said 'Lord have mercy upon
me, and forgive me my errors!' and immediately mounted the upper
stage. He had come pinioned with a black sash, and was unwilling
to have his hands tied, or his face covered, but was persuaded to
both. When the rope was put round his neck, he turned pale, but
recovered his countenance instantly; and was but seven minutes from
leaving the coach, before the signal was given for striking the stage.
As the machine was new, they were not ready at it: his toes touched
it, and he suffered a little, having had time, by their bungling, to raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
his cap; but the executioner pulled it down again, and they pulled
his legs, so that he was soon out of pain, and quite dead in four minutes.
He desired not to be stripped and exposed; and Vaillant
promised him, though his outer clothes must be taken off, that his
shirt should not. This decency ended with him: the sheriffs fell to
eating and drinking on the scaffold, and helped up one of their friends
to drink with them, while he was still hanging, which he did for
above an hour, and then was conveyed back with the same pomp to
Surgeons' Hall, to be dissected. The executioners fought for the
rope; and the one who lost it, cried. The mob tore off the black
cloth as relics; but the universal crowd behaved with great decency
and admiration, as they well might, for sure no exit was ever made
with more sensible resolution and with less ostentation."</p>

<p>The contrivance above described has caused the cart to fall into general
disuse on such occasions. The change, however, was not suddenly
effected. For many years after the death of Lord Ferrers, the triangular
gallows at Tyburn maintained its ground, and, on execution-days,
the cart passed from Newgate up Giltspur-street, and through
Smithfield to Cow-lane; Skinner-street had not then been built, and
the crooked lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's church, as
well as Ozier-lane, did not offer sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade
passing by either of them with convenience to Holborn-hill.</p>

<p>For centuries the prevailing opinion had been, that executions
ought to take place at a distance from the crowded part of the city.
Anciently malefactors were put to death at <em>The Elms</em> in Smithfield, or
rather, between Smithfield and Turnmill-street. But when the
houses had increased, so as to encroach on the space which had long
been kept open there, it was thought expedient to carry those appointed
to die, farther off; and a spot was fixed upon, which received
the name of Tyburn, near the beginning of Tottenham-court-road.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
When Holborn had been built up to St Giles's, a farther removal was
deemed necessary, and these tragic scenes were carried from one
end of Oxford-street to the other,&mdash;from the beginning of Tottenham-court-road
to the Tyburn of the present day.</p>

<p>But at length, in the reign of George the Third, it was judged
better to abandon the parade so long kept up, and to execute the
sentence of death in the immediate vicinity of Newgate. This alteration,
though many reasons may be urged in its favour, was not
universally approved. There were those who apprehended that, in
a constitutional point of view, it was dangerous to abate the publicity
which had so long attached to the consummation of the last severity
of the law. Mr. Horne Tooke was of the number. To hang a felon
at the door of his prison, he considered, "the next thing to putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
him to death within the walls," and directly approximating towards
secret executions.</p>

<p>By degrees, however, the public mind got perfectly reconciled to
the change. Much expense and confusion were spared; and the idle
were no longer indulged in a disgusting holiday, to witness a spectacle
in but too many instances known to produce anything but the
impression which might have been desired. The rabble went to the
mournful scene as to a public entertainment. The procession to
Tyburn, with the prayers and other ceremonies there, occupied a
large portion of the day, which many of the spectators closed in dissipation,
outrage, and robbery.</p>

<p>Instead of carrying the condemned three miles, and executing the
culprits from a cart, an apparatus was now erected close to Newgate;
and the awful ceremony, no longer made the business of many hours,
was regularly performed at eight o'clock in the morning, and every
vestige of the deplorable scene put away between nine and ten.
Some of the first executions witnessed at Newgate were most unlike
those which have been seen of late years, even before the late
king ascended the throne. Not fewer than eighteen or twenty
persons were conducted to the scaffold on the same day; and the
gallows originally set up in the Old Bailey was so contrived that
three cross-beams could be used, and the sufferers were, by this contrivance,
disposed in as many rows.</p>

<p>By degrees these spectacles grew less frequent, and the numbers
hurried into eternity on each occasion were fewer. The execution
of five or six persons on one day became an uncommon sight, and
seldom more than two or three suffered together.</p>

<p>This comparatively small sacrifice of life did not make the Old
Bailey less attractive on a hanging-day than Tyburn had formerly
been, though the rabble were constantly dismissed shortly after the
clock struck nine.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the present century, a notorious highwayman
of the name of Clark, with five other malefactors, submitted
to the last severity of man together. I went before the day had
dawned, and very shortly after the preparations had commenced, to
the Old Bailey. The spectacle then presented was most picturesque;
and to me, whatever it might be to others, most extraordinary.
Wooden posts made in a triangular form with rails, and a rod of iron
issuing from the tops to pass through holes prepared in strong bars
of timber, which they were to sustain, were lying about in every
direction. Lighted torches were carried by the workmen and their
assistants, the bars being first laid along the ground, nearly on or
over the spot where they were to be set up to keep off the crowd,
while the preparations went forward for the work of death. The
body of the drop had previously been brought out. This did not
take to pieces, but was kept, as at present, standing in the yard attached
to the prison; and, being placed on wheels, was&mdash;I might say
is, as executions have not wholly ceased,&mdash;drawn out at a very early
hour. It was curious to notice the interest, the levity, the indifference,
which prevailed in the different groups drawn together as
the awful hour approached, according to the various humours of the
individuals who composed them. When the cross-beam of the gallows
was raised to its place, it was gazed on with great eagerness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
As each rail was fixed, to mark the boundary of the space to be kept
clear, a mass of men and boys, with here and there a female, ranged
themselves close to it. The constables were occasionally seen struggling
through the human wall thus formed, and showing their authority&mdash;the
staff of office, to prove their right to be there; a form by
no means unnecessary, as many of them were only to be known by
that sign, as in truth they were almost impostors, having only assumed
the character in which they appeared, for the day, being engaged
by the respectable tradesmen really serving the office, to save
them the time that would be consumed, or to spare feelings that
must be wounded, if they appeared <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propriâ personâ</i>.</p>

<p>The scaffold was established at the Debtors'-door, in the widest
part of the Old Bailey; and the bar which was placed as above described
extended from the further side of the scaffold, to a few feet
south of the governor's house. The steps leading to the Felons'-door
were soon crowded; and several recesses and niches on that
side of the prison were peopled from an early hour with living
statues.</p>

<p>Well do I remember the awe with which I heard the chimes of St.
Sepulchre's church announce the lapse of another and another quarter
of an hour, the calculations which were made of the exact
number of minutes which the victims had yet to breathe, and the speculations
as to the manner in which they were then engaged, and the
deportment which they would assume in the closing scene.</p>

<p>The appearance of the city marshals between seven and eight
arranging the constables, announced that the time had nearly arrived.
A humourist would have jested at the overacted dignity of
the functionaries just named of that day. A Wellington disposing
his ranks to meet the fiercest shock of the best warriors of France,
could not have given a finer idea of the importance of command, than
these civic heroes suggested while placing in Newgate order their
crowd of clubmen.</p>

<p>It had been usual to hang black cloth on the chains which ran
along three sides of the scaffold. On the occasion now recalled this
part of the ceremonial was not omitted. The black was duly paraded;
but so beggarly a display in connexion with any public proceeding
my <em>not</em> "young memory" cannot parallel. It had been so
worn and torn, that such a collection of tatters, it might fairly be concluded,
could hardly have been found in any part of his Majesty's dominions,&mdash;Rosemary-lane,
perhaps, excepted. The idlers, who by this
time had assembled in great force, and who&mdash;the majority of them at
all events&mdash;evidently considered they had but to enjoy themselves,
laughed immoderately, and indulged in all sorts of jokes on this Ragfair
set-out; which, to confess the truth, as their streamers, shaped
into all imaginable forms, fluttered in the wind,&mdash;bearing in mind the
solemnity of the occasion, and the supposed object of the exposure of
the sable shreds, namely, mourning,&mdash;was the perfection of burlesque.</p>

<p>The hand of St. Sepulchre's clock was pointed at the quarter to
eight. Fifteen minutes more, and the unhappy ones appointed to die
were expected to ascend that platform from which they were to sink
into eternity. The immense multitude extended far up Giltspur-street
one way, and almost reached to Ludgate-hill in the opposite
direction. In all the houses commanding a view of the gallows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
windows were crowded; the ledges without the parapets and roofs
were in like manner surmounted by numerous spectators.</p>

<p>It would not be easy to describe the sensation created by the appearance
of the very important actors who next came on the stage,&mdash;the
executioners.</p>

<p>"Here are Jade Ketch and his man!" was the exclamation of
almost every individual in the crowd to his neighbour.</p>

<p>There was something in the look of the men which really challenged
attention. The principal, or "Jack Ketch himself," as he was
called, was a tall, elderly personage. His costume presented a long
blue frock-coat, a scarlet waistcoat, and his hose bound with red
garters below the knee-buttons of his inexpressibles. He wore a
flower in his coat, or carried one in his mouth. He surveyed the
eagerly-staring populace, and sustained their gaze with an air of calm
indifference, which, however, had nothing of startling effrontery about
it. His assistant was a very different figure; he was a coarse-featured,
pock-marked, short, thick-set man. All his motions indicated
great vivacity; and, if a judgment might be formed from his exterior,
he was proud and rejoiced to fill an office of such high distinction,
and felt more satisfaction in reflecting on the conspicuous
situation in which he was placed, than pity for the poor creatures
who almost instantly were to be committed to his professional care.
He generally wore dark clothes; but sometimes had a bit of his
master's distinguishing finery,&mdash;a red waistcoat. He nimbly paced
the scaffold on this occasion, and looked on the mob, as I fancied,
with an air of mirth or exultation, and presently applied himself, with
no bad taste, to tear down the miserable black rags which have been
mentioned; and, I believe, since that day they have never reappeared,
or anything of the kind in their place. This operation completed,
he seemed to confer with the other hangman on the business
before them. The tall steps necessary to enable them to attach the
halters to the gallows they moved towards the end of the platform
near the spot on which the first who came forth was to stand; and,
everything now being ready, they composedly waited the coming of
the sheriffs with their prisoners.</p>

<p>The clock of St. Sepulchre's church struck eight; a murmur burst
from the vast assemblage near it: and the solemn bell of St. Paul's
cathedral a moment afterwards confirmed, so to speak, the announcement
of the fatal hour. All was expectation. The executioners frequently
looked towards the door from which those expected, were
to advance, as if to ascertain if they were coming. There was something
of excitement in their manner, and a silent indescribable movement
among those within the enclosure, that told more distinctly than
could speech, that the last scene was about to open.</p>

<p>It was nearly ten minutes after eight when the heavy tone of the
prison-bell was heard. Such a sound!&mdash;a knell of death sounded for
the living, who were then in perfect health, but who were next minute
to be consigned to the grave, is well calculated to thrill the most
unfeeling. This usage always appeared to me to heighten the solemnity
of the scene, and the misery of the convicts for whom it tolled.
Yet the authorities deemed it a compliment, or honour, to the sufferer,
too great to be conceded in every case. The murderer, for instance,
was denied the privilege of hearing it. None but those condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
for the less heinous crimes of forgery, or other capital felony
unattended with the spilling of human blood, were <em>favoured</em> with the
melancholy distinction.</p>

<p>The signal for the bell, I believe, was given at the instant when the
brief procession, from the room in which the prisoners were pinioned
to the door from which they pass to the final scene of expiation, commenced.
The sullen sound was but three or four times repeated
when those immediately in front of the prison-entrance saw the white
wand of the sheriff approach from within. An officer appeared ascending
the ladder, and by his side a man whose solemn aspect indicated
with sufficient clearness that he was one of the doomed. The
next moment he had passed to the platform, and stood in presence of
the gazing populace. When the wand, the insignia of office, was
seen, the word was given "Hats off!" and the multitude on every side
obeyed the mandate, and stood uncovered.</p>

<p>The unfortunate man who appeared first of the six who were to surrender
their lives on this day, was perfectly resigned to his deplorable
fate. His eye was bright, his step was firm, and it was impossible for
a human being in such circumstances to be more collected, or to deport
himself with more propriety. If sorrow at leaving this world oppressed
him, hope solaced him with the cheering prospect that it
would be his, immediately, to enter on a better. He wore his hat,&mdash;such
being the usage at that time,&mdash;which was removed by the executioners,
and placed at one end of the scaffold; and then the clergyman
made his appearance. With him the culprit conversed devoutly,
but with cheerfulness. His cravat having been taken off, the old executioner
elevated himself by the steps, put the fatal noose over the
sufferer's head, on which the cap was immediately placed, and the
end of the halter being then passed round the beam, was carefully
tied. The chain and hook now introduced had not yet been adopted.
The companions in woe and death of the unfortunate I have described,
quickly followed. Clark was the third or fourth that appeared,
and he had the weakness to distinguish himself by the idle bravado
of throwing away his hat. To each of them the ordinary addressed
a few words. The caps, which had been left up for some moments,
were next drawn down over the whole face. A prayer was commenced;
but, before it concluded, the minister passed a white handkerchief
over his mouth. That was the fatal signal; the drop fell with
a dismal noise, and the death-struggle ensued. It was then twenty
minutes after eight, and in three or four minutes, all appearance
of life had ceased. In the same instant that they were suspended
the crowd began to withdraw, while those who had been at a distance
pressed forward to gain a more distinct view of the appalling
spectacle. A cry of horror burst from a portion of the multitude
when the floor gave way; but the impression it made was singularly
transient. In less than a quarter of an hour cool indifference was
everywhere to be marked, and foolish levity and boisterous mirth succeeded
to the awe and commiseration lately manifested.</p>

<p>A year or two after this scene, the public mind was violently excited
by the case of Governor Wall. This culprit, twenty years before,
being then the king's representative at Goree, had caused a
man to be flogged so severely that he died. He was present when
the punishment was inflicted, and excited the floggers by calling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
them, "Cut his liver out!" among other horrible expressions. The
crime of whipping a man to death was well calculated to awaken public
indignation; but it was not his guilt alone which caused the ferment
then witnessed in the metropolis. The belief that, because he had
been a governor, mercy was likely to be shown to him, which would
be denied to another, probably sealed his doom, and proved a cruel
aggravation of his wretched destiny. He was tried on a Wednesday,
and ordered for execution on the Friday next following, but was respited
till Monday. This was considered an indication that the sentence
would not be carried into effect at all, although on the last-mentioned
day a vast crowd assembled in the Old Bailey. A second
respite had been granted; but this was not generally known, at least
to the multitude congregated on the occasion. Great was the disappointment
when the hour of seven struck, and no preparations for the
execution were visible. Many clung to the expectation that it would
yet take place; and several affirmed, untruly I believe, that the apparatus
had often been brought out and erected after that hour. I mingled
with some of the numerous groups, and listened to the discussions,
which were carried on with great vivacity, on the subject of the
crime, and probable fate of the criminal. Not till after eight was the
idea totally abandoned that the raging thirst of the infuriated populace
for his blood would not then be gratified. It was between eight
and nine that I had an opportunity of speaking with Mr. Newman,
the governor of Newgate, and learned from him that further time had
been granted, and that Wall was to suffer on the coming Thursday.</p>

<p>The mob separated with bitter execrations; and the belief that a
murderer, whose guilt was of the blackest dye, would escape punishment
because he had powerful friends, gained ground throughout the
nation. If horror had previously been inspired by his crime, to that
personal and political rancour were now added, and the public mind
was in a state of violent exasperation. The Thursday arrived! and
another crowd assembled in front of Newgate, but doubting much
whether the spectacle so ardently desired would at last be offered to
their longing eyes. Though the officers were at their posts, and the
scaffold in its place, it was still insisted that the governor would escape
the fate he merited. The most ridiculous stories were circulated
of the influence exercised in his favour, and of the culpable resolution
of those who were in power to prevent the administration of
justice. These, however, were all confuted when the appointed hour
arrived, and the miserable object of public indignation was brought
out to suffer like a common offender.</p>

<p>When Governor Wall heard his sentence pronounced on the Wednesday,
with whatever dismay it filled him, he prepared to submit to
it with resignation. He threw himself, when he had returned to the
prison, on his wretched bed, and said he should not rise from it till
the officers of justice came to lead him to his fate. The respites granted
awakened in him a hope not before entertained, only to render the
rigour of the law more dreadful, from the unsettled state of his mind
up to the last moment.</p>

<p>He was a remarkably fine man in appearance, standing more than
six feet high. When he came on the scaffold, his figure served
but to swell the exultation of the crowd. As he advanced, he
was greeted with three loud huzzas. When these subsided, a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
ferocious voices addressed to the executioners the language
which the cruel governor was charged with having used while the
victim of his severity was writhing under the lash. The furious exclamations
were not lost on the criminal; he requested the executioners
to perform their part as expeditiously as possible. The drop almost
instantly fell, and the shouts of the mob were in that dreadful moment
renewed. He struggled long, and it was supposed that his sufferings
were greater than those of any other victim on whom the same
sentence had been executed. When about to be turned off, Wall
entreated that his legs might not be pulled. The wish was respected
till his long-protracted agonies compelled the sheriff, in the humane
performance of his duty, to order that it should be done in order to
terminate his misery. After hanging an hour, he was cut down; and
the remains were conveyed in a cart, attended by a joyful rabble, to
a house in Castle-street, Saffron-hill, there to be anatomized.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the period of which I have been speaking, an idea
was entertained of recurring to the old mode of execution; at least it
was revived on one occasion. A triangular gallows was made, and
sockets were inserted in the road, opposite Green-arbour-court, to receive
the supporting posts. On this, Anne Hurle, convicted of forgery,
and a male culprit, were put to death, about thirty years ago. The
criminals were brought out at the Felons'-door in a cart, and carried to
the upper end of the Old Bailey. There, after the necessary preparations,
the ordinary took his leave. The executioner urged the horse
forward, and the vehicle was drawn from under the feet of the criminals.
The motion caused them to swing backwards and forwards;
but this was speedily stopped by the hangman, who leaped from the
cart for the purpose. It appeared to the spectators that the victims
suffered more than they would have done if executed from the drop.
This was probably represented to the city authorities, for the latter
method of carrying the law into effect was promptly restored.</p>

<p>It was formerly the usage, when a crime of remarkable atrocity
had been committed, to execute the offender near the scene of his
guilt. The minds then exercised on these painful subjects judged
that a salutary horror would be inspired by the example so afforded,
and that localities once dangerous would thus be rendered comparatively
secure. Those who were punished capitally for the riots of 1780
suffered in various parts of the town; and, in the year 1790, two incendiaries
were hanged in Aldersgate-street, at the eastern end of
Long-lane. Since that period there have been few executions in
London except in front of Newgate. The last deviation from the regular
course was in the case of a sailor named Cashman, who suffered
death about the year 1817, in Skinner-street, opposite the house of a
gunsmith whose shop he had been concerned in plundering. The
gunsmith was anxious that this should not be; but his voice was
overruled, and the criminal was carried in a cart to the scaffold. It
was then, it should seem, supposed that an awful warning would be
given to the dissolute in Skinner-street, which would be in a great
measure lost if the executioner performed his work at a distance of
some forty yards from the scene of depredation.</p>

<p>Time, which alters everything, effected a remarkable change in
this respect; and, however appalling the guilt of the condemned, it
was at length presumed to be adequately visited by death in the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
Bailey. When the fiend-like Burkers were brought to justice, they
were sent to their account at the usual place of execution. To mark
horror for their crime, or to arrest its progress in the neighbourhood
of Shoreditch, it was not thought necessary to erect the gallows in
Nova Scotia Gardens.</p>

<p>In the course of the rambling thoughts and recollections here
brought together, it has been shown that various alterations have
from time to time been made; and one, not the least remarkable,
has recently been brought under public notice. Formerly it was
usual for the recorder to report the cases of those sentenced at one
Old Bailey sessions, to the king in council after the next ensuing sessions.
It however not unfrequently happened that, through negligence,
or perhaps from a feeling of commiseration for those to whom
it must bring death, the report was postponed, till the cases of
several sessions remained in arrear. In those days loud were the
complaints on the subject of the evil consequences of the delay. The
grand argument against it was, that the long interval which separated
punishment from crime caused the latter to be forgotten by the
public, and the violater of the law was in consequence regarded with
sympathy to which he had no just claim: the wrong, the violence
which he had perpetrated, were almost wholly lost sight of; and thus
the lesson, that an ignominious death would promptly requite a fearful
crime, was feebly impressed on the minds of the pitying spectators.
Such was the notion when executions followed at some considerable
distance from conviction, and the superior efficacy of the
course taken with regard to murders was often referred to as being
directly in point. Now, this is changed; death for robbery or forgery
is hardly known, and he who is sentenced to die for hurrying a fellow-creature
out of existence has five or six weeks allowed him to
prepare for eternity. In noticing the change, I do not mean to censure
it. Time will show whether the course now taken is followed
by an increase of homicide: as yet it is too early to pronounce an
opinion; but no suspicion of the sort up to the present moment has
been entertained.</p>

<p>One strange practice was common to all executions at Newgate:
a number of persons were "rubbed for wens," as it was called. Men,
women, and children afflicted with them were introduced within the
body of the vehicle of death, and elevated so as to be seen by the
populace, within a few minutes after the convicts had been turned off.
The patients were then indulged with a choice of the individual culprit,
from those who had suffered, whose touch was to be applied to
the part affected. The hands of the corpse selected were untied by
the executioner, and gently moved backwards and forwards for about
two minutes, which was supposed sufficient to effect a cure. This
custom has now ceased; it was abolished as a piece of contemptible
superstition, the continuance of which it would be disgraceful to
permit. The executioner was deprived of this lucrative part of his
business, without receiving for it any public compensation.</p>

<p>A strange sail is always a matter of interest in a ship of war;
and no sooner was the canvass set in chase of the brig mentioned in
my last, than the forecastle of the Spankaway received its usual group
of yarn-spinners, anxious to ascertain the character of the stranger,
and what amount of prize-money was likely to be shared in case of
her carrying an enemy's flag. There was our old friend Jack Sheavehole,
together with Joe Nighthead, Bob Martingal, Bill Buntline, and
several others; and occasionally the warrant-officers, and even the
mate of the watch, stopped to chime in with a few words, so as to
give life to their conversation.</p>

<p>"It bothers my univarsal knowledge," said old Savage, the boatswain,
"to make out what lay the skipper's on; and as for the chase,
mayhap she mayn't turn out to be moonshine arter all."</p>

<p>"How moonshine?" returned Mr. Bracebit, the carpenter; "she's
plain enough to be seen, and they've made her out to be a brig: there
can be no moonshine in that, anyhow."</p>

<p>"But I tell you there is moonshine in it," persevered the boatswain,
"a complete bag o' moonshine, unless you can diskiver the right
bearings and distance o' the thing. I tell you what it is, Mr. Bracebit,
I arn't been these many years man and boy in the sarvice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You should say boy and man, old Pipes," exclaimed the mate
of the watch as he stopped short in his walk by the veteran's side.</p>

<p>"And why should I say boy and man, instead of man and boy, Mr.
Winterbottom?" demanded old Savage in anger.</p>

<p>"Because, according to your own maxim, everything should be
done ship-shape," replied the other; "and you was a boy before
you was a man."</p>

<p>"He has him there," whispered Jack Sheavehole to his messmate
Bob. "I'm bless'd if that arn't plain-sailing, anyhow!"</p>

<p>"Ship-shape do you call it?" answered the boatswain wrathfully.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Muster Winterbottom, mayhap it may be according to your
calculations of the jometry of the thing. It's nothing new now-a-days
to see the boy put forud afore the man;" and he laid strong emphasis
on the latter words.</p>

<p>"There he hit him again, Jack," observed Bob Martingal in a
whisper; "and I'm blowed if there arn't Gospel truth in that, anyhow!"</p>

<div class="caption">Joe Nighthead and the Mummies</div>
</div>

<p>"Well, well, don't be angry, old friend," said Mr. Winterbottom,
himself somewhat offended; "there's no occasion for being hot upon
it; but, if you are, you may go to &mdash;&mdash; and cool yourself!"</p>

<p>"And a precious queer place that 'ud be for a cold-bath," said the
carpenter: "but let's have no contentions, gentlemen. What do
you take the brig to be, Mr. Winterbottom?"</p>

<p>"A ship with her mizen-mast out, bound to Bombay, with a cargo
of warming-pans," replied the young officer.</p>

<p>"That arn't being over civil, anyhow," whispered Bob to his messmate;
"though mayhap they may want warming-pans in Bumbay as
much as they do in the West Ingees. To my thinking, she's a treasure-craft
laden with mummies."</p>

<p>"Did you ever fall athwart any o' them there hanimals, Bob?"
inquired Joe Nighthead.</p>

<p>"What hanimals do you mean, Joe?" returned Martingal. "For
my part, I've seen a little somut of everything."</p>

<p>"I means the mummies," replied Joe, as he squatted down in
amidships just before the foremast, in preparation for a yarn, and
was soon surrounded by the rest;&mdash;"I means the mummies, my boyo."</p>

<p>"No; can't say as I have," answered Bob; "though I've heard
somut about 'em, too:&mdash;what rig are they?"</p>

<p>"Why, for the matter o' that," said Joe, laughing, "they're broomstick-rig
as soon as they makes a brush of it; but I'm blow'd if I
hadn't onest as pretty a spree with a whole fleet of mummies as ever
any man could fall aboard of in this world, or t'other either."</p>

<p>"What was it, Joe?" asked the boatswain's mate eagerly. "Pay
it out handsomely, messmate; but don't pitch us any of Bob's devil's
consarns;&mdash;let's have it all truth and honesty."</p>

<p>"I'd scorn to deceive <em>you</em>, Jack, or anybody else o' my shipmates
wot's seamen," responded Joe reproachfully. "It's all as true as the
skipper's a lord, and looks, alongside o' Johnny Cropoh there, like a
man alongside of a&mdash;But, there,&mdash;it arn't honourable to make delusions;
and so, shipmates, here goes for a yarn. I was coxswain in
the pinnace of the ould Ajax, the Honourable Captain Cochrane, at
that 'ere time when Sir Richard Bickerton took command of the
fleet, and a flotilla was employed in co-operating with the troops
again' Alexandria. Well, shipmates, I was always fond of a bit of
gab; and so, the night we lay at a grapplin', waiting for daylight to
begin the attack, my officer gets to talking about the place, and what
a grand consarn it was in former days for gould and jewels, and sich
like; and thinks I to myself, mayhap the Lords of the Admirality
will take all that 'ere into account in regard o' the prize-money: and
then he overhauls a good deal about the hobbylisks and Clipsypaddyree's
Needle, and what not, that I'm blow'd if it didn't quite bamfoozle
my larning. Well, we'd four or five days' hard work in the
fighting way, and then there was a truce, and my officer run the pinnace
aboard of a French prize laden with wine and brandy; so we
starts the water out of one of the breakers and fills it with the real
stuff, and I man-handled a pair of sodgers' canteens chock-full; and
the prize-master, Muster Handsail, an old shipmate of mine, gives me
a two-gallon keg to my own cheek, and I stows 'em all snug and
safe abaft in the box, and kivers 'em up with my jacket to keep 'em
warm. Well, it was just getting dusk in the evening when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
skipper claps us alongside, and orders the leftenant to land me well
up the lake, so as I might carry a letter from him across to a shore
party as manned one of the heavy batteries away inland, at the back
of the town.</p>

<p>"Now, in course, shipmates, I warn't by no manner o' means piping
my eye to get a cruise on <em>terror firmer</em>, seeing as mayhap I might
chance to pick up some 'o' the wee things aboot the decks' as likely
wud get me a bottle o' rum in England,&mdash;for, my thoughts kept running
on the gould and jewels the leftenant spun the yarn about, and I'd
taken a pretty good whack of brandy aboard the prize, though I warn't
not in the least tosticated, but ounly a little helevated, just enough
to make me walk steady and comfortable. So we run the boat's nose
on to the beach, and I catches up my jacket and my canteens, leaving
the keg to the marcy of Providence, and strongly dubersome in my
mind that I had bid it an etarnal farewell. Howsomever, I shins
away with my two canteens filled chock ablock; and 'Bear a hand,
Joel' says the leftenant, 'though I'm blessed if I know what course
you're to take, seeing as it's getting as dark as a black fellow's
phisog.'&mdash;'Never fear, yer honour,' says I; 'ounly let me catch sight
o' Clipsypaddyree's Needle for a landmark, and I'm darned if I won't
find myself somewhere, anyhow;' and away I starts, shipmates, hand
over hand, happy go lucky&mdash;all's one to Joe! But it got darker and
darker, and the wind came down in sudden gusts, like a marmaid
a-sighing; so, to clear my eyes, and keep all square, I was in course
compelled to take a nip every now and then out of the canteen, till
at last it got so dark, and the breeze freshened into a stiff gale, that
the more I took to lighten my way and enable me to steer a straight
course, I'm blessed, shipmates, if I didn't grow more dizzy; and as
for my headway, why, I believes I headed to every point in the compass:&mdash;it
was the dark night and the cowld breeze as did it, messmates."</p>

<p>"No doubt in the world on it, Joe," assented Jack Sheavehole;
"for if anything could have kept you in good sailing trim, it was the
brandy, and the more especially in token o' your drinking it neat;&mdash;them
dark nights do play the very devil with a fellow's reckoning
ashore, in regard of the course and distance, and makes him as apt
to steer wild, like a hog in a squall."</p>

<p>"You're right, Jack," continued Nighthead; "and anybody as
hears you, may know you speaks from experience o' the thing. Howsomever,
there I was,&mdash;not a sparkler abroad in the heavens, not a
beacon to log my bearings by; and, as I said afore, there I was in
a sort of no-man's-land, backing and filling to drop clear of shoals,
sometimes just at touch-and-go, and then brought-up all standing,
like a haystack a-privateering. At last the weather got into a downright
passion, with thunder, lightning, and hail; and 'I'm blessed,
Joe,' says I to myself, 'if snug moorings under some kiver or other,
if it's ounly a strip o' buntin', wouldn't be wastly superior to this
here!' But there was no roadstead nor place of shelter, and the way
got more rougherer and rougherer, in regard o' the wrecks of ould
walls and ould buildings, till I'm blessed if I didn't think I was getting
into the latitude and longitude of the dominions of the 'long-shore
Davy Jones."</p>

<p>"My eyes, Joe!" exclaimed Martingal, replenishing his quid from
an ample "'bacca" box, "but you was hard up, my boy!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed and I was, Bob," responded the other; "and I'm blowed
if every thing as I seed about me didn't begin to dance jigs and hornpipes
to the whistling of the wind, that I thought all manner of bedevilment
had come over me, and so I tries to dance too, to keep
'em company. But it wouldn't do, shipmates, and I capsizes in a
sudden squall, and down I went, headforemost."</p>

<p>"It's precious bad work that, Joe," said the old boatswain's mate,
shaking his head. "A fellow in an open sea may do somut to claw
to wind'ard; but when you're dead upon a lee-shore, it's time to
look for your bag. But what did you do, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Why, what could I do, shipmate, but to take another nip at the
canteen," responded Joe; "it was all I had in life to hould on by,
with a heavy gale strong enough to blow the devil's horns off, and the
breakers all round me: my eyes! but it was a reg'lar sneezer.
'Howsomever,' thinks I, 'it won't do, Joe, to be hove down here for
a full due&mdash;you must at it again, ould chap;' and so I tries to make
sail again, and heaves ahead a few fathoms, when down I comes again
into a deep hole, and, before you could say Jack Robison, I'm blow'd
if I warn't right slap in the middle of a large underground wault, where
there was a company o' genelmen stuck up in niches, and peeping
over mummy-cases, with great candles in their hands; and in other
respects looking for all the world like the forty thieves as I once
seed at the play, peeping out of their oil-jars; and there was a
scuffling and scrimmaging at t'other eend o' the wault: and, 'Yo
hoy!' says I, 'what cheer&mdash;what cheer, my hearties!' but not nobody
never spoke, and the genelmen in the niches seemed to my thinking
to be all groggy, and I'm blessed if ever I seed sich a set o' baboon-visaged
fellows in all my days. 'Better luck to us, genelmen,' says I,
filling my tot and taking a dram; but not a man on 'em answered.
'Pretty grave messmates I've got,' says I; 'but mayhap you don't
hail as messmates, seeing as you arn't yet had a taste o' the stuff.
Come, my hearties, I'll pipe to grog, and then I'll sarve it out all
ship-shape to any on you as likes.' So I gives a chirp, and 'Grog
ahoy!' sings I. Well, shipmates, I'm blessed if one on 'em didn't
come down from the far eend o' the wault, and claps me alongside as I
was sitting on the ground, and he takes hould o' the tot, knocks his
head at me, as much as to say, 'All in good fellowship,' and down
went the stuff through a pair o' leather lips in the twinkling of a hand-spik.
'All right, my hearty,' says I, filling the tot again: 'is there
any more on you to chime in?'&mdash;'Sailor,' says he, in a voice that
seemed to come from a fathom and a half down underneath him, for
I'm blowed, messmates, if his lips ever moved;&mdash;'sailor, you must
get out o' this,' says he.&mdash;'Lord love your heart,' says I, 'the thing's
onpossible; you wouldn't have the conscience to make an honest tar
cut and run in sich a rough night as this here.'&mdash;'We arn't never got
no consciences,' says he; 'we're all dead.'&mdash;'Dead!' says I laughing,
though, messmates, I own I was a bit flusticated; 'dead!' says I;
'that's gammon you're pitching, and I thinks it's hardly civil on you
to try and bamboxter me arter that fashion. Why, didn't I see you
myself just now when you spliced the main brace?&mdash;dead men don't
drink brandy.'&mdash;'We're privileged,' sings out a little cock-eyed fellow
up in one o' the niches; 'we're the ould ancient kings of Egypt, and
I'm Fairer.'&mdash;'If there warn't many more fairer nor you,' says I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
'you'd be a cursed ugly set, saving your majesty's presence,' for I
thought it best to be civil, Jack, seeing as I had got jammed in with
such outlandish company, and not knowing what other privileges they
might have had sarved out to 'em besides swallowing brandy. 'Will
your majesty like just to take a lime-burner's twist, by way of warming
your stumack a bit, and fumigating your hould?' says I, as I
poured out the stuff.&mdash;'Give it to King Herod, as is moored alongside
of you,' says he, 'and keep your thumb out of the measure;' for,
shipmates, I'd shoved in my thumb pretty deep, by way of lengthening
out the grog, and getting a better allowance of plush. How
the ould chap came to obsarve it, I don't know, unless it was another
of their privileges to be up to everything. 'Keep your thumb out!'
says he.&mdash;'All right, your honour,' says I, handing the little ould fellow
the tot; and he nipped it up, and knocked off the stuff in a moment.
And 'Pray,' says I, 'may I make bould to ax your honour
how long you've been dead?'&mdash;'About two thousand years,' says he:
and, 'My eyes!' thinks I, 'but you're d&mdash;d small for your age.'&mdash;'But,
sailor,' says he, 'what brought you here?'&mdash;'My legs, your
honour,' says I, 'brought me as far as the hatchway; but I'm blowed
if I didn't come down by the run into this here consarn.'&mdash;'You
mustn't stop here, sailor,' says he,&mdash;'that's King Herod,&mdash;you can
have no business with us, seeing as we're all mummies.'&mdash;'All what?'
says I, 'all dummies?' for I didn't catch very clearly what he said;
'all dummies?' says I. 'Well, I'm bless'd if I didn't think so!'&mdash;'No,
no! mummies,' says he again, rather cantankerously; 'not
dummies, for we can all talk.'&mdash;'Mayhap so, your majesty,' says I,
arter taking another bite of the cherry, and handing him a third full
tot, taking precious good care to keep my thumb out this time: 'but
what am I to rouse out for? It ud take more tackles than one to stir
Joe Nighthead from this. I'm in the ground-tier,' says I, 'and
amongst all your privileges, though you clap luff upon luff, one live
British tar, at a purchase, is worth a thousand dead kings, any day.'&mdash;'Haugh!'
says he, as he smacked his leather lips, and the noise was
just like a breeze making a short board through a hole in a pair of
bellows; 'Haugh!' says he, as soon as he'd bolted the licker, 'it
doesn't rest with us, my man: as mummies, we're privileged against
all kinds of spirits.'&mdash;'Except brandy,' says I.&mdash;'I means evil spirits,'
says he: 'but if the devil should come his rounds, and find you here
upon his own cruising-ground, he'd pick you up and make a prize of
you to a sartinty.'&mdash;'D&mdash;the devil!' says I, as bould as a lion, for I
warn't a-going to let the ould fellow think I was afeard of Davy Jones,
though I was hard and fast ashore; and 'D&mdash;the devil,' says I,
'axing your majesty's pardon; the wagabone has got no call to me,
seeing as I'm an honest man, and an honest man's son as defies him.'
Well, shipmates, I had my head turned round a little, and something
fetches me a crack in the ear, that made all sneer again, and
'Yo hoy! your majesty,' says I; 'just keep your fingers to yourself,
if you pleases.'&mdash;'I never touched you,' says he; 'but there's one
close to you as I can see, though you can't.'&mdash;'Gammon!' says I; 'as
if your dead-eyes were better than my top-lights.'&mdash;But, shipmates,
at that moment somut whispers to me,&mdash;for may I be rammed and
jammed into a penny cannon if I seed anything; but somut whispers
to me, Joe Nighthead, I'm here over your shoulder.'&mdash;'That's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
my name all reg'lar enough, whatever ship's books you got it from,'
says I: 'But who the blazes are you that's not nothing more than a
woice and no-body?'&mdash;'You knows well enough who I am,' says the
whisper again; 'and I tell you what it is, Joe, I've got a job for you to
do.'&mdash;'Show me your phisog first,' says I, 'or I'm blow'd if I've anything
whatsomever to say to you. If you are the underground Davy
Jones, it's all according to natur, mayhap; but I never signs articles
unless I knows the owners.'&mdash;'But you <em>do</em> know <em>me</em>, Joe,' says the
woice, that warn't more nor half a woice neither, in regard of its being
more like the sigh of a periwinkle, or the groan of an oyster.&mdash;'Not a
bit of it,' says I; for though I suckspected, shipmates, who the
beggar was, yet I warn't going to let him log it down again me without
having hoclar proof, so 'Not a bit of it,' says I; 'but if you wants
me to do anything in all honour and wartue,'&mdash;you see, Jack, I didn't
forget wartue, well knowing that when the devil baits his hook he
claps a 'skylark' on to the eend of it; so, 'all in honour and wartue,'
says I, 'and Joe's your man.'&mdash;'Do you know who's alongside of
you?' says the woice.&mdash;'Why, not disactly,' says I: 'he calls himself
King Herod; but it's as likely he may be Billy Pitt, for anything I
knows to the contrary.'&mdash;'It <em>is</em> King Herod,' says the whisper again;
'the fellow who killed all the Innocents,'&mdash;'What innocents?' axes I,
seeing as I didn't foregather upon his meaning.&mdash;'The innocent babbies,'
says the woice; 'he killed them all, and now he's got a cruising
commission to keep me out o' my just rights, and I daren't attack him
down below here.'&mdash;'The ould cannibal!' says I: 'what! murder
babbies?&mdash;then I'm blowed if he gets a drop more out of my canteen.'&mdash;'Who's
that you're meaning on?' says King Herod; 'who
isn't to get another taste?'&mdash;'Not nobody as consarns you, your honour,'
answers I, for I didn't like to open my broadside upon him, in
regard of not knowing but he might have a privilege to man-handle
me again.&mdash;'I think you meant me,' says he; 'but if you didn't, prove
the truth on it by handing me over a full gill.' Well, shipmates, that
was bringing the thing to the pint, and it put me into a sort of quandary;
but 'All in course, your honour,' says I; 'but I'm saying,
your majesty, you arn't never got sich a thing as a bite o' pigtail
about you&mdash;have you? seeing as I lost my chaw and my 'bacca-box
in the gale&mdash;hove overboard to lighten ship.'&mdash;'Yes, I can, my man&mdash;some
real Wirginny,' says the king."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the sergeant of marines; "go it, Joe;&mdash;you'll
rival Tom Pepper presently. Why, Virginia is only a late
discovery; such a place wasn't known in the days of Herod, nor tobacco
either."</p>

<p>"To my thinking it's wery hodd, Muster Jolly, that you should
shove your oar in where it arn't wanted," muttered Joe. "Why?&mdash;couldn't
they have a Wirginny in Egypt? and as for the 'bacca, I'm
blowed if I don't wouch for the truth on it, for out his majesty lugs
a box as big round in dameter as the top of a scuttle-butt, and,
knocking off the lid, 'There's some of the best as ever was many-facter'd,'
says he. 'I loves a chaw myself, and there's nothing whatsomever
as 'ull beat the best pound pig-tail.'&mdash;'Sartinly not, in course,
your honour,' says I; 'but I'm blessed if it doesn't double upon my
calculations o' things to think how your majesty, who ought to be in
<em>quod</em> in t'other world, should take your <em>quid</em> in this.'&mdash;'We're privileged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
my man,' says he; 'we're privileged and allowed to take
anything, in reason,' and he fixed his glazed eyes with a 'ticing
look at the canteen. 'You know,' says he, 'that it's an ould saying
aboard, "the purser makes dead men chaw tobacco."' Well, shipmates,
that was a clencher in the way of hargyfication that brought
me up all standing; so I hands King Herod the tot again, and I
rouses out a long scope of pig-tail out o' the box, and takes another
nip at the brandy.&mdash;'You won't do it, then, Joe,' says the whisper
t'other side of me.&mdash;'What is it?' axes I.&mdash;'The best pound pigtail,'
says King Herod, as if he thought I was speaking to him.&mdash;'It's
ounly to borrow one of these here mummies for me for about half an
hour,' says the woice.&mdash;'Which on 'em?' says I.&mdash;'This here in the
box,' says King Herod. 'Why, I'm thinking your brains are getting
all becalmed.' And so they was, shipmates; for, what with the
woice at one ear that I couldn't see, and his majesty at the other,
who often doubled himself into two or three, I'm blowed if I warn't
reg'larly bamboozled in my upper works."</p>

<p>"You was drunk, Joe," said the sergeant of marines; "it's very
evident you was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non compos mentis</i>."</p>

<p>"And, what if I hadn't a nun compass to steer by?" replied Joe
angrily, "is that any reason I should be tosticated? I tell you I
warn't drunk, in regard o' the full allowance o' brandy I stowed in
my hould to keep me steady and sober. Ax Jack there if it's any
way likely I should be drunk."</p>

<p>"It stands to reason, not," argued Jack Sheavehole, "or, what's
the use of a fellow having the stuff sarved out at all? Short allowance
only brings a mist afore the eyes and circumpollygates the head
till everything looms, like Beachy in a fog. But when you've your
full whack, it clears the daylights, cherishes the cockles o' your
heart, and makes you more handy, 'cause you often sees two first
leftenants where there's ounly one."</p>

<p>"Dat berry true, massa Jack," said Mungo Pearl; "me al'ays
sweep de deck more clean when me tink me hab two broom in me
hand."</p>

<p>"In course," continued Joe, more soothed; "none but a Jolly would
go to say anything again it, or doubt the woracity o' the thing. Well,
shipmates, to heave ahead, I'm saying I was reg'larly bamblustercated
when one of the genelmen up in the niches squeaks out, 'King
Herod, I'll just thank you for a thimble-full of the stuff.'"</p>

<p>"Did he say 'a thimble-full?'" inquired Sam Slick, the tailor.
"It couldn't be a professional thimble, then, for they never has no
tops to 'em. It shows, however, the antickity of thimbles; though I
thought they never had any use for them in those days."</p>

<p>"And why not, you lubber?" asked Bob Martingale.</p>

<p>"Simply because their garments were not sewed together as they
are in the present day," answered the tailor.</p>

<p>"Tell that to the marines, Sam," said the boatswain's mate; "why
what was Clipsypaddyree's needle for, eh? But, get on, Joe; there's
no conwincing such ignoramasses."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, messmate!" uttered Joe. "'Well,' says the genelman
in the niche, 'I'll thank you for a thimbleful of that 'ere stuff.'&mdash;'With
all the pleasure in life, your honour,' says I as I filled up the
tot, and was going to carry it to him, but&mdash;&mdash;'Give it to me, I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
take it,' says King Herod;' and up he gets,&mdash;my eyes! I never seed
such a queer little ould chap in all my life!&mdash;and off he bolts to
t'other mummy, steering precious wild, by the way; and he tips him
the <em>likser witey</em>, and then back again he comes, and brings up in his
ould anchorage. 'May I make bould to ax your majesty,' says I,
'what the name o' that genelman is as you've just sarved out the
stuff to?'&mdash;'He's not a genelman, not by no manner o' means,' says
he, 'in regard of his being a king.'&mdash;'And King who?' axes I.&mdash;'You're
werry quizative, Muster Sailor,' says he; 'but it's in the
natur o' things to want to know your company. That's King Hangabull.'&mdash;'And
a devilish queer name, too,' says I, 'for a fellow to turn
into his hammock with. Is he of Irish distraction?'&mdash;'His mother
was an Irishman,' says the king, 'and his father came out of a Cartridge.'&mdash;'And
a pretty breed they'd make of it,' says I, 'somut
atwixt a salt cod and a marmaid.'&mdash;'Will you steal me a mummy?'
comes the whisper again; 'you'd better, Joe.'&mdash;'No threats, if you
please,' says I.&mdash;'I never threatened you,' says the king, who thought
I was directing my discourse to him; 'but, sailor, I must call over all
their names now to see there's none absent without leave,'&mdash;and I'm
blow'd if he didn't begin with King Fairer; but there was a whole
fleet of King Fairers and King Rabshakers, and King Dollyme, and
ever so many more, every one answering muster, as if it had been a
rope-yarn Sunday for a clean shirt and a shave, till at last I got fairly
foozlified, and hove down on my beam-ends as fast asleep as a parish-clerk
in sarmon time."</p>

<p>"A pretty yarn you 're spinning there, Mister Joe," said old Savage,
who it was evident had been listening,&mdash;as he had often done
both before and since he mounted his uniform coat:&mdash;"A pretty
yarn you're spinning. I wonder you arn't afeard to pay out the
slack o' your lies in that fashion."</p>

<p>"It's all true as Gospel, Muster Savage," responded Joe: "I seed
it, and suffered it myself, and afore I dropped asleep&mdash;'Mayhap,'
thinks I, 'if I could steal a mummy for myself to give to my ould mother,
it 'ud be a reg'lar fortin to her,&mdash;dead two thousand years, and
yet drink brandy and chaw tobacco!' So I sleeps pretty sound,
though for how many bells I'm blessed if I can tell; but I was waked
up by a raking fire abaft, that warmed my starn, and I sits upright to
clear my eyes of the spray, and there laid King Herod alongside of
me, with one of the canteens as a pillow, and all the ould chaps had
come down out o' their niches, and formed a complete circle round
us, that made me fancy all sorts of conjuration and bedevilment; so
I jumps up on to my feet, and lets fly my broadsides to starboard and
port, now and then throwing out a long shot a-head, and occasionally
discharging my starn chasers abaft till I'd floored all the mummies,
and the whole place wrung with shouts of laughter, though not a living
soul could I see, nor dead uns either,&mdash;seeing as they'd nothing but
bodies. Well, shipmates, if the thought didn't come over me again
about bolting with one on 'em, and so I catches up King Herod, and
away I starts up some steps,&mdash;for the moon had got the watch on
deck by that time, and showed her commodore's light to make every
thing plain:&mdash;Away I starts with King Herod, who began to hollow
out like fun, 'Stop&mdash;stop, sailor! stop!&mdash;where are you going to take
me? I'm Corporal Stunt.'&mdash;'Corporal H&mdash;!' says I, 'you arn't going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
to do me in that way,&mdash;you said yourself you was King Herod.'&mdash;'It
was all a trick,' says he, again, kicking and sputtering like
blazes; 'I'm not King Herod, I'm ounly Corporal Stunt,' says he.&mdash;'That
be d&mdash;;' says I, 'you're conwicted by your own mouth. And
didn't the woice tell me you was the barbarous blaggard as murdered
the babbies?'&mdash;'Yes,&mdash;yes; but I did it myself,' says he.&mdash;'I know
you did,' says I, fetching him a poke in the ribs,&mdash;for, shipmates, I
made sure he warn't privileged above ground,&mdash;'I know you did,' says
I, 'and I'm blessed if the first leftenant shan't bring you to the gangway
for it!' And then he shouts out, and I hears the sound of feet
astarn coming up in chase, and I carries on a taut press, till I catches
sight of Clipsypaddyree's needle, that sarved me for a beacon, and I
hears the whole fleet of mummies come 'pad-pad' in my wake, and
hailing from their leather-lungs, 'Stop, sailor&mdash;stop!' but I know'd a
trick worth two of that, shipmates; so I made more sail, and the little
ould chap tries to shift ballast so as to bring me down by the head;
but it wouldn't do, and he kept crying out, 'Let me down! pray let
me go, I'm ounly Corporal Stunt!'&mdash;'Corporal Stunt or Corporal
Devil,' says I, giving him another punch to keep him quiet; 'I knows
who are you, and I'm blessed if the ould woman shan't have you
packed up in a glass cage for a show! you shall have plenty o' pigtail
and brandy:' and on I carries, every stitch set, and rattling along at a
ten-knot pace, afeard o' nothing but their sending a handful o' monyments
arter me from their bow-chasers, that might damage some of
my spars. At last I makes out the battery, and bore up for the entrance,
when one of the sodgers, as was sentry, hails, 'Who goes
there?'&mdash;'No&mdash;no!' says I, seeing as I warn't even a petty officer.&mdash;'That
won't do,' says the sodger; 'you must give the countersign.'&mdash;'What
the blazes should I know about them there things?' axes I,
'you may see I'm a blue-jacket.'&mdash;'You can't pass without the countersign,'
says he.&mdash;'That be d&mdash;d!' says I, 'arn't I got King Herod
here? and arn't there King Fairer, and King Dollyme, and King
Hangabull, and a whole fleet more on 'em in chase!' says I.&mdash;'Oh,
Tom Morris, is that you?' says King Herod.&mdash;'Yes,' says the sentry;
'why, I say, sailor, you've got hould o' the corporal!'&mdash;'Tell that to
the marines,' says I, 'for I knows well enough who he is, and so shall
my ould mother when I gets him home! But, I'm blessed, but here
they come!' and, shipmates, I heard 'em quite plain close aboard o'
me, so that it was all my eye to be backing and filling palavering
there afore the sentry, and get captured, and with that I knocks him
down with King Herod, and in I bolts with my prize right into the
officer's quarters. 'Halloo! who the devil have we got here?' shouts
the leftenant, starting up from his cot.&mdash;'It's not the devil, your
honour,' says I, 'not by no manner o' means; it's Joe Nighthead, and
King Herod,' and I pitches the wagabone upright on to his lower
stancheons afore the officer.&mdash;'There, your majesty,' says I, 'now
speak for yourself.'&mdash;'Majesty!' says the leftenant, onshipping the
ould fellow's turban and overhauling his face,&mdash;'majesty! why, it's
the corporal&mdash;Corporal Stunt; and pray, Muster Corporal, what
cruise have you been on to-night?'&mdash;and then there was the clattering
of feet in the battery, and, 'Here they all are, your honour!' says I,
'all the ould ancient kings of Egypt as are rigged out for mummies.
My eyes, take care o' the grog bottles, for them fellows are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
very devil's own at a dram! Stand by, your honour! there's King
Dollyme and all on 'em close aboard of us! but, I'm blowed if I
don't floor some on 'em again as I did in the wault!' Well, messmates,
in they came; but, instead of mummies in their oil jars, I'm
bless'd if they warn't rigged out like sodger officers, and they stood
laughing at me ready to split their sides when they saw me squaring
away my yards all clear for action."</p>

<p>"But, what was they, Joe?" inquired the boatswain's mate, "they
must have shifted their rigging pretty quick."</p>

<p>"I think I can explain it all," said the sergeant, laughing heartily,
"for I happened to be there at the time, though I had no idea that
our friend Joe here was the man we played the trick on."</p>

<p>"Just mind how you shapes your course, Muster Sergeant!" exclaimed
Joe, angrily. "I'd ounly give you one piece of good adwice,&mdash;don't
be falling athwart my hawse, or mayhap you may wish
yourself out o' this."</p>

<p>"Don't be testy, Joe," said the sergeant, "on my honour I'll tell
you the truth. Shipmates, the facts are these:&mdash;I belonged to the
party in the battery, and went with some of the officers to explore
a burial-ground, not without hopes of picking up a prize or two, as
the report was that the mummies had plates of gold on their breasts.
Corporal Stunt went with us; and, when we got to the place we
lighted torches and commenced examination, but, if they ever had
any gold about them the French had been there before us, for we
found none. Whilst we were exploring, a storm came on, and not
being able to leave the vault the officers dressed Stunt up in some of
the cerements that had been unrolled from the mummies by way of
amusement, little expecting the fun that it was afterward to produce.
When Joe came in as he has described, we all hid ourselves, and, if
truth must be spoken, he was more than half sprung." Joe grumbled
out an expletive. "Stunt went to him, and we had as fine a piece of
pantomime&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Panter what?" uttered Joe, with vehemence, "there's no such
rope in the top, you lubber! and arter all you can say I werily believes
it wur King Herod; but, you see, messmates, what with running
so hard, and what with losing my canteens, I got dumbfoundered
all at once, and then they claps me in limbo for knocking down the
sentry."</p>

<p>"And the officers begged you off," said the sergeant, "on account
of the fun they'd enjoyed, and you was sent away on board, to keep
you out of further mischief, Joe, and to prevent your going a mummy-hunting
again. As for Corporal Stunt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Corporal D&mdash;n!" exclaimed Joe in a rage, "it's all gammon
about your Corporal Stunt; and in regard o' the matter o' that, what
have you got to say in displanation o' the woice? There I has you
snug enough anyhow; there was no mistake about the woice," and Joe
chuckled with pleasure at what he deemed unanswerable evidence in
his favour.</p>

<p>"It may be accounted for in the most sensible way imaginable,"
said the sergeant; "Corporal Stunt was what they call a ventriloquist."</p>

<p>"More gammon!" says Joe; "and, what's a wentillerquis, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
like to know; and how came the mummies to muster out of their
niches when I woke?"</p>

<p>"We placed them there whilst you were asleep," replied the sergeant,
"and, as for Stunt, he was as drunk and drowsy as yourself."</p>

<p>"Ay,&mdash;ay, sergeant!" said Joe, affecting to laugh, "it's all wery
well what you're overhauling upon, but I'm blessed if you'll ever
make me log that ere down about Corporal Stunt and the wentiller
consarn. I ounly wish I had the canteens now."</p>

<p>"Get a musket ready there for'ard!" shouted his lordship from
the gangway, "fire athwart the brig's bows."</p>

<p>"They seem to be all asleep aboard, my lord!" said Mr. Nugent.
"At all events they don't seem to care much about us."</p>

<p>"You're mistaken, Mr. Nugent," replied his lordship, as he directed
his night-glass steadily at the stranger, "she's full of men, and if
I am correct in my conjectures, there are many, very many eyes anxiously
watching our motions."</p>

<p>The musket was fired, and the brig came to the wind with her
maintopsail to the mast. The frigate ranged up to windward of her,
and the sonorous voice of Lord Eustace was heard,</p>

<p>"Brig a-hoy! What brig's that?"</p>

<p>"L'Hirondelle de Toulon," responded the commander of the vessel
hailing through his speaking-trumpet. "Vat sal your ship be?"</p>

<p>"His Britannic Majesty's frigate, the Spankaway," answered Lord
Eustace: "lower away the cutter, Mr. Nugent, and board her."</p>

<p>The two craft had neared each other so closely, and the moon shone
with such clearness and splendour, that every thing was perfectly visible
from each other on the decks of both. The brig was full of men,
and when Lord Eustace had announced the name of his ship, the
sounds had not yet died away upon the waters when out burst a
spontaneous cheer from the smaller vessel such as only English
throats could give,&mdash;it was a truly heart-stirring British demonstration,
and there was no mistaking it. The effect was perfectly electric
on the man-of-war's men,&mdash;the lee gangway was instantly crowded
as well as the lee ports, and, as if by a sudden communion of spirit
that was irrepressible, the cheer was returned.</p>

<p>There is amongst thorough tars a sort of freemasonry in these
things that no language can describe,&mdash;it is the secret sign, the mystery
that binds the brotherhood together,&mdash;felt, but not understood,&mdash;expressed,
yet undefined.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" shouted his lordship as soon as the cheering
had subsided.</p>

<p>"From Genoa, bound to Malta, your honour," answered a voice in
clear English: "we're a Cartel."</p>

<p>"Fortune favours us, Monsieur Capitaine," said his lordship to
Citizen Begaud; "the exchange of prisoners can be effected where
we are, and I will take it on my own responsibility to dismiss you on
the usual terms, if you wish to return to France."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, my lord," returned Begaud, with evident
satisfaction. "Yet all places are alike to me now. You have heard
my narrative, and I hope, if we part, you will not hold me altogether
in contempt and abhorrence. My spirits are depressed&mdash;my star is
dim and descending&mdash;my destiny will soon be accomplished."</p>

<p>"You fought your ship bravely, Monsieur," said Lord Eustace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
"and I trust your future career will redeem the past. You have
suffered much, and experience is a wise teacher to the human mind.
But there is one thing I am desirous of having explained. You say
that Robespierre detained you for some time before he gave you a
pardon for the Countess&mdash;do you think he was aware of her approaching
execution?"</p>

<p>"Aware of it, my lord?" exclaimed the French Captain, in a tone
approaching to a shriek: "Danton, whom you well remember I said
I met quitting the bureau, had the death-warrant, with the wretch's
signature, in his hand&mdash;'twas solely for the purpose of destruction
that he detained me&mdash;he knew the villain would be speedy&mdash;they
had planned it between them."</p>

<p>"All ready with the cutter, my lord," exclaimed Mr. Sinnitt,
coming up to the gangway, and saluting his noble captain.</p>

<p>"Board the brig, Mr. Nugent, and bring the master and his papers
to the frigate," directed Lord Eustace. "Call the gunner&mdash;a rocket
and a blue light."</p>

<p>Both orders were obeyed; the signal was readily comprehended by
Mr. Seymour, who hove-to in the prize, and in a few minutes Nugent
returned from his embassy with the master of the cartel and the
officer authorized to effect an exchange. The papers were rigidly
examined&mdash;there were no less than one hundred and six Englishmen
on board the brig, the principal portion of whom had been either
wrecked or captured in merchant-men, and were now on their way to
Malta for an equal number of French prisoners in return; the commander-in-chief
at Genoa, rightly judging that British humanity would
gladly accede to the proposition. There were no officers, but Lord
Eustace undertook to liberate Citizen Captain Begaud&mdash;the preliminaries
were arranged&mdash;the Frenchmen, man for man, were transferred
to the brig (his lordship throwing in a few hands who earnestly
implored his consideration)&mdash;the Englishmen were received on board
the frigate&mdash;necessary documents were signed, and they parted
company&mdash;the brig making sail for Toulon&mdash;the Spankaway rejoining
her prize.</p>

<p>"We've made a luckly windfall, Seymour," hailed his lordship
when the frigates had closed; "I've a hundred prime hands for you.
Out boats, Mr. Sinnitt, and send the new men away directly&mdash;but first
of all, let every soul of them come aft." A very few minutes sufficed
to execute the command. "My lads," said his lordship, addressing
them, "are you willing to serve your country?&mdash;speak the word. I've
an object in view that will produce a fair share of prize-money&mdash;enter
for his majesty's service, and you shall have an equal distribution
with the rest. Yonder's your ship, a few hours will probably bring
us into action, and I know every man will do his duty."</p>

<p>With but few exceptions, the seamen promptly entered, and were
sent away to the Hippolito, where Mr. Seymour was instructed to
station them at the guns with all possible despatch.</p>

<p>"Well, here we goes again," said old Savage, as the order was
given to bear up and make sail, "it's infarnally provoking not to be
able to discover what the skipper's arter. There's the Pollytoe
running away ahead, and Muster Seymour's just fancying himself
first Lord o' the Admirality."</p>

<p>"Beat to quarters, Mr. Sinnitt," exclaimed his lordship, "and cast
loose the guns."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'm &mdash;&mdash; if I can make anything on it, Jack," grumbled
the boatswain; "what are we going to engage now&mdash;the Flying
Dutchman, or Davy Jones?"</p>

<p>"Mayhap a whole shole of Joe's mummies, sir," said Jack Sheavehole,
with a respectful demeanour, as he cast loose his gun upon the
forecastle, and threw his eye along the sight. Suddenly his gaze
was fixed, he then raised his head for a moment, looked eagerly in the
same direction, and once more glanced along the gun. "Well, I'm
blessed if there aint," says he,&mdash;his voice echoed among the canvass
as he shouted&mdash;"two sail on the starboard bow."</p>

<p>"Who's that hailing?" said the captain, as he walked forward to
the bows, with his glass under his arm.</p>

<p>"It's Jack Sheavehole, your honour, my lord," replied the boatswain's
mate, his eye still steadily fixed upon the objects.</p>

<p>"If they're what I expect, it will be a hundred guineas for you,
my man, and, perhaps something better," said his lordship. "Where
are they?"</p>

<p>"Just over the muzzle of the gun, my lord," answered Jack, as a
fervent wish escaped him, that his lordship's expectations might be
realized; for the hundred guineas, and something better, brought to
his remembrance Suke and the youngsters.</p>

<p>Lord Eustace took a steady persevering sight through his night
glass, as the men went to their quarters, and the ship was made
clear for action; his lordship then ascertained the correct distance
of the Hippolito ahead to be about two miles. "Get top-ropes
rove, Mr. Savage," said he; "heave taut upon 'em, and see all clear
for knocking the fids out of the topmasts."</p>

<p>"Ay ay, my lord," responded the boatswain, as he prepared for
immediate obedience, but mumbling to himself, "What the&mdash;&mdash;
will he be at next; rigging the jib-boom out o' the cabin windows,
and onshipping the rudder, I suppose. Well, I'm &mdash;&mdash;, if the sarvice
arn't going to the devil hand-over-hand; I shouldn't be surprised if
we have to take a reef in the mainmast next."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sinnitt," said his lordship, "let them pass a hawser into the
cutter,"&mdash;the boat had not been hoisted up again,&mdash;"take the plug
out, and drop her astern."</p>

<p>"D'ye hear that, Joe?" growled the boatswain; "there'll be more
stores expended if she breaks adrift, and I'm &mdash;&mdash; if I can make it out;
first of all, we goes in chase o' nothing&mdash;now here's a couple o' craft
in sight, that mayhap may be enemies' frigates,&mdash;he's sinking the
cutter to stop our way. Well, we shall all be wiser in time."</p>

<p>The strangers were made out to be two ships, standing in for the
land, and whilst they were clearly visible to the Spankaway and the
Hippolito, the position the moon was in prevented the strangers from
seeing the two frigates. At length, however, they did obtain sight
of them, and they immediately hauled to the wind, with their heads
off shore.</p>

<p>"There's a gun from the prize, sir," shouted one of the men forward,
as the booming report of a heavy piece of ordnance came over
the waters.</p>

<p>"Run out the two bow-guns through the foremost ports, and fire
blank cartridge," said his lordship. "Where's the gunner?"&mdash;Mr.
Blueblazes responded, "Ay ay, my lord."&mdash;"Draw all the shot on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
the larboard side," continued Lord Eustace, to the great astonishment
of the man of powder, and still greater surprise of the old boatswain.</p>

<p>"Mr. Seymour is making signals, my lord," said the third lieutenant;
"and he's altered his course towards the strangers."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Nugent," said his lordship; "let them blaze
away with the bow-guns, but be careful not to shot them."</p>

<p>The Hippolito kept discharging her stern chasers as she stood
towards the strangers, who made all possible sail away, and the
Spankaway fired her bow-guns without intermission, as she pursued
her prize.</p>

<p>"What an onmarciful waste of powder," said the boatswain to his
mate; "I say, Jack, just shove in a shot to take off the scandal o'
the thing."</p>

<p>Whether Jack complied or not, is unknown. The boat astern was
cut away, the Spankaway felt relieved, and drew up with the prize;
the strangers retained their position, about three or four miles distant,
and thus the chase continued till daylight, no one being able to
make out what it all meant.</p>

<p>One of the evils of an increasing population is the difficulty of finding
names for all the new-comers. As long as the census remained
proportionate to the superficies of the country, and every man could
entrench himself within the walls of his own domicile, or isolate himself
between his own hedges, the principle of individuality continued
unassailed; but when, from a thousand causes, the population became
doubled, almost within our recollection, and men were forced to herd
together, gregarious by compulsion, we felt that a blow had been
struck at personal identity which it would require the utmost ingenuity
to parry.</p>

<p>Amongst the many responsibilities entailed upon parents, not the
least, in these prolific times, is that of providing their offspring with
names which shall carry them safely through the wear and tear of
after-life without encroaching upon the privileges, or sharing in the
disgraces, of others. The man, for instance, who <em>happens</em> to bear the
<em>not-impossible</em> name of Smith, and who chooses to christen his son by
the not-uncommon one of John, commits an error as fatal as can well
be imagined. At school that son is buffeted by mistake, and birched
by accident, for the broken windows and invaded orchards: the acts
of another John Smith. As he advances towards man's estate, his
good reputation is stolen, and a bad one substituted, by the graceless
conduct of a namesake. He is dunned for debts he never contracted,
rendered liable for hearts he never broke, and imprisoned for assaults
he never committed. He is superseded in the affections of his mistress
by another John Smith, disinherited on his account, and when
he dies&mdash;for even Smiths must die&mdash;no tear is shed to his memory,
no record commemorates his decease; like the pebble which is cast
into the ocean, a little circle just marks the spot for a moment, and
the waves of oblivion roll over it for ever!</p>

<p>The same melancholy fate haply attends the possessors of the
names of Green, Brown, Jones, Robinson, Thompson, and others no
less familiar. The destiny of one becomes involved in the general
lot of all; the multitude can no more distinguish between them than
they can separate one sheep from a flock, or one bee from a swarm.
The hand of fate is on the unhappy crowd,&mdash;"they are the victims
of its iron rule;" and victimised to a certainty they would have remained,
had not a boldly-conceiving individual invented a mode of
particularising that which was general, severing the with which bound
them in one universal faggot. It was effected in this wise. He considered
the name he bore&mdash;one of those already alluded to&mdash;as being
only the type of <em>man</em>; and, spurning at the imbecility or indifference
of a godfather, who had thus neutralised his existence at the very
outset, he resolved to intercalate certain high-sounding appellations,
which of themselves would attract sufficient attention, but, when
combined with his own futile denomination, would be sure to strike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
from the absurdity of the contrast, or singularity of the juxta-position.
Thomas Brown was a name as insignificant as parents or sponsors
could make it; but when, in the course of time, it swelled itself
into Thomas Claudius Fitzwilliam Carnaby Browne, it was impossible
to pass it unregarded. The feat once accomplished, like the broken
egg of Columbus, it became of easy performance; and few were the
Thompsons, few the Simpsons, and fewer still the Johnsons, who did
not claim "the benefit of the act."</p>

<p>A prospective advantage was included also in their calculations.
As time wore away, the obnoxious Thomas or John was silently
dropped; and then, by a daring <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-maître</i>, the plebeian sur-name,
which had been gradually contracting its powers, was altogether
sunk, and the grub became a butterfly of most aristocratic pretensions.
This is no vain theory founded on chance occurrences,
but a truth which every one will recognise who runs over the list of
his acquaintance, or examines the visiting-cards on his mantel-piece.
It is as impossible now-a-days to meet with a man content to bear
the opprobrium of a single monosyllabic name, as to raise money
without security, or induce any one to avoid politics in conversation.
The ancient prejudice against the "homo trium literarum" is now
wholly removed; and we verily believe that Cavendish Mortimer
Pierrepoint, an acknowledged scion of the swell-mob, would find more
favour in the eyes of society than plain Benjamin Bunks, a well-known
respectable hosier or linendraper, if a question of right were at issue
between them.</p>

<p>There are two classes of persons who build up to themselves an
altar of vain-glory founded on names of self-assumption. The first
are those who, being cast originally in the basest metal, add the
pinchbeck of quality to enhance the value of the original plebeian
pewter; the second, of "dull and meagre lead," who thereunto conjoin
the glare of brass or gloom of iron by the adoption of double
names of equal dissonance. Examples are rife everywhere. Mr. and
Mrs. Vokins, while their fortune was yet to make, were happy and
content "as such;" but, the carriage once set up, the arms <em>found</em>, and
the visiting-cards printed, her friends are awake to the pleasing consciousness
that "Mrs. Ferdinand Vokins" is "at home" every alternate
Wednesday during the season.</p>

<p>Mr. Mudge was a plain, simple Glo'stershire squire, shooting partridges
on the paternal acres, and called "Young Mr. Mudge," as
manhood and whiskers expanded on his native soil. He comes to
town, sees the world, and discovers, for the first time, despite the
importance which inflates him, that he is nameless. He accordingly
borrows from the French, and is straightway transformed into "the
interesting Mr. Montmorency Mudge, who plays so divinely on the
flute," though his very existence had been a question but a few brief
hours before.</p>

<p>The Badgers, though proud of course of their name <em>as a family
name</em>, have daughters to marry, and sons to provide for: it is of no
use to be good unless one appears so; and therefore Mrs. <em>Howard</em>
Badger's suppers are the best in town, while Mr. Howard Badger is
received with smiles at the Treasury.</p>

<p>Plain Boss would have succeeded nowhere, except, perhaps, on a
street-door; but Felix Orlando Boss may enter the gayest drawing-room
in Christendom, announced by files of intonating footmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span></p>

<p>We are invited to dine, and seek to ascertain the profit and loss of
the invitation by inquiries of a fellow <em>convive</em> as to the guests who will
be there: he is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'ami de la maison</i>, and, to give due emphasis to the
description, and honour to the Amphitryon, he thus enumerates them.
"Oh, you'll have the Mortimer Bullwinkles, Mr. and Mrs. Frederick
Cutbush, the Stafford Priddys, Sir Montague Stumps, Mr. Temple
Sniggers, the Beauchamp Horrockses, and Mrs. Courtenay Cocking;
nobody else, that I remember." "Won't the Wartons be there?" "I
don't know,&mdash;who are they?&mdash;I never heard of them:&mdash;what's their
<em>other</em> name?"</p>

<p>And so it is: this "other name,"&mdash;this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alter ego</i>&mdash;becomes the grand
desideratum in description,&mdash;the passport to fashion and celebrity.</p>

<p>The anonymous in authorship is no longer regarded, save in the
instance of those veterans in literature whose silence is more significant
than the loud-tongued voices of a million aspirants. We need
no sign-post to show us the way to London, neither do we seek a
name to anticipate their page. But the new candidates for fame are
of a different order. The title-page of a work is in their estimation
a maiden shield whereon it is their privilege to quarter the names of
all their lineage, concentrated in themselves, or pompously appealed
to in the names of others. Hence we have, "Rambles in Russia, by
Charles Valentine Mowbray Muggins;" "Thoughts on the Poor-Laws,
by Pygmalion Gammage;" "The Exile; a poem, by Brownlow
Busfield, of the Middle Temple, Barrister-at-Law;" "Desperation;
a novel, by Grenville Grindle, Esq.;" "The Veil Withdrawn, or, A
Peep behind the Curtain, by the Nieces of the Hon. and Rev.
Fitzherbert Fineclark;" and "Domestic Tyranny, or, The Stony-hearted
Step-father, by Lavinia Cecilia Bottomley, only child of the
late Captain Roderick Bottomley, of the Bombay Cavalry."</p>

<p>It is no longer our cue to be rendered "illustrious by courtesy;"
we compel the admiration which the niggard world so carefully withholds,
and extort the approbation it would smother. It matters little
how raw, how shapeless, how crude, how undigested be the mass
when drawn from the quarry of its creation; its uncouth aspect and
angular deformity offer no impediment to the lapidary's skill, but rather
enhance its value; and the more barbarous the name which
ignorant parents have transmitted, the wider is the scope afforded to
their descendants for rendering the adjunct more brilliant by the
contrast.</p>

<p>He who is born Buggins, and changeth not, perisheth unregarded;
his name appears in the Newgate Calendar, and whatever his fate, it
is deemed a just one. But he who (though equally degraded in the
annals of nomenclature by the repulsive or sneaking appellations of
Jaggers, Blatcher, Gullock, or Lumkin,) adds to his patronymic the
soft seduction or romantic interest of Albert, Eustace, Stanley, or
Fitzmaurice, may appeal to the lord in waiting, or a patroness at
Almack's, and kiss the hand of royalty, or bow at the shrine of
beauty.</p>

<p>The motto is old and true, which many "gentlemen of coat-armour"
do bear, that "Fortune favours the bold;" the daring speculators
in the names of others are eminently successful in their adventure
after greatness. To this category belong the sheriffs and
aldermen, the bearers of addresses, and the deputed of corporations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
these are they who may literally be said to have greatness "thrust
upon them."</p>

<p>The Mayor of Norwich, hight Timothy Gamblebuck, urged by the
ambitious spiritings of Mrs. G., kneels at his sovereign's feet, and,
rewarded by an accolade, returns, in the triumph of knighthood and
plenitude of loyalty, "Sir Timotheus Guelph Gamblebuck" by <em>more</em>
than royal permission.</p>

<p>Mr. Sheriff Hole, presented by a peer, and similarly honoured by
the king, marks his sense of his patron's kindness by the insertion of
his title before the cavernous epithet, and figures at urban festivals
as Sir John Cornwallis Hole, the most aristocratic on the shrieval
archives.</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke Fuggles, Sir Cholmondeley Bilke, Sir Constantine
Peregrine Rumball, Sir Temple Gostick, and Sir Peter Sackville
Biles, are amongst the many whom female instigation or personal desire
have led to illustrate the glory of ancient houses. It is somewhere
said in "Pelham" that one's unknown neighbour, or opposite
at dinner, must necessarily be a baronet and Sir John; it is no less
true that at the corner of every street, in the avenues of every ballroom,
a newly created knight lies in waiting to devour one. A man
with a bright blue coat, and, if possible, brighter buttons, with black
satin waistcoat and <em>very</em> gold chain, with large hands and a face of
red portent, cuts in with us at whist; his antagonists are perpetually
appealing to him by his brilliant title. "It is your deal, Sir Vavasour,"&mdash;"My
ace, Sir Vavasour,"&mdash;"Sir Vavasour, two doubles and
the rub;"&mdash;till, bewildered by the glories of our feudal partner, we
lose the game, and stealthily inquire of some one near, "Who <em>is</em> the
gentleman opposite?" "Sir Vavasour Clapshaw" is the whispered
reply, recalling the name of one much respected in our youthful days,&mdash;a
celebrated artist in the cricket-bat line, who has now pitched
his wicket within the precincts of aristocracy, and bowls down society
with the grandeur of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préfixe</i>.</p>

<p>A lady in crimson velvet, with a bird of paradise in her blue and
silver "turband," and a marabout boa wreathed round her neck, with
long white gloves tightened unto bursting, and serpentine chains
clinging unto suffocation, is seated in lofty pride at the <em>upper</em> end of
the <em>principal</em> saloon, and overwhelms by the dignity of her demeanour
all who come within the vortex of her "full-blown suffisance."</p>

<p>"Lady&mdash;what did you say? Harcourt, or Harewood,&mdash;which?&mdash;I
didn't distinctly hear." "Yes, Lady Harcourt." "Why, I thought
she was dead." "Oh, yes, the <em>Countess</em> is dead; but this is Lady
Harcourt Bumsted: that's her husband, Sir Julius,&mdash;he was knighted
last Wednesday."</p>

<p>"There's honour for you!&mdash;grinning honour," as Falstaff has it.</p>

<p>Notabilities like these are nearly as illustrious as the surreptitious
knights and dames who, by dint of surpassing impudence, pass current
for as good as they. Both classes remind us of the gypsy-herald
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rouge-Sanglier</i>," whose colours were as bright, and trappings
as gay, as those of the legitimate "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toison d'Or</i>:" they have but one
fault; like him, their blazon is false, their arms are wrongly "tricked,"
metal overlays metal, gold covers brass, and native <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gules</i> gives
way to intrusive purple. The glory of our chivalry is often awkwardly
eclipsed when it happens that a Frenchman is called upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
to designate the new-made knight; he treats his Christian name with
as much indifference as he manifests in the spelling of his surname,&mdash;a
rule he always applies to those of British growth. We know a clever,
shrewd, little, antiquarian Frenchman, whom no persuasion can induce
to abbreviate a single letter of reference to page, folio, edition,
or date; but who, whenever he has occasion to mention a knight or
baronet of his acquaintance, invariably omits his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de baptême?</i>.
How pleasantly it would sound to hear the announcement of "Sir
Biddles," "Sir Doody," or "Sir Farwig!" and yet this would be the
predicament of these worthies were they ungraced by noble <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prænomina</i>.</p>

<p>The second class whose merits we propose to discuss are the illustrators
of the "Binomial Theorem,"&mdash;the double-named families,&mdash;who,
too hideous to walk alone, conjoin ugliness of equal intensity to
scare and appal wherever they make their way. It is not sufficient
for such as they that their name be Groutage or Gramshaw; they incontinently
connect it&mdash;if they can&mdash;with "a worser," (to use the
showman's phrase,) and "double-up" with Rapkin or Titterton.
Thus we hear, at our morning concert, Mrs. Rapkin Gramshaw's carriage
stopping the way; and a vain and desolate outcry in the Opera
colonnade for the chariot of Mrs. Titterton Groutage. It would matter
little if we were only doomed to <em>hear</em> these names thus generally
repeated; but there is a mode of administering them which makes
us <em>feel</em> them, scorching and searing our inmost heart of hearts! A
double name&mdash;no matter how base or dissonant&mdash;is held to be the
most grateful to ears polite, as if the natural consequence of the intermarriage
of two great discords must of necessity give birth to harmony.</p>

<p>How often have we writhed under the cruel infliction, when, betrayed
by bad weather during a morning call, we have sat through
the tedious hour of detaining rain, and listened to the forgotten glories
of the races of Slark and Cutbush! It is a rule with <em>all people</em>,&mdash;no
matter how they may be designated <em>now</em>, or how utterly their
names defy the ingenuity of antiquaries to render their etymology,&mdash;to
derive their ancestral honours from the time of William the Conqueror!
It is true that the bastard Duke had a general letter of licence
for the enlistment of all the vagabonds that swarmed in Europe
at the period of his expedition; and we know how many ruffians of
all classes, from the predatory baron to the pillaging freebooter,
thronged to his standard,&mdash;and so far there may often be some show
of reason in the pretension.</p>

<p>But our claimants for origin among the Conqueror's <em>noblesse</em> are
not to be expected to dwell on this point with historical minuteness;
what they wish to imply when they tell us that "the Smookers and
Tites came over with the Conqueror," is, that they were equal in
station to the De Albinis and De Warennes, who led their forces to
the battle of Hastings, and gave the Conqueror his crown.</p>

<p>"Ours is a very old family indeed," says a thick-headed Devonshire
squire, with scarcely wit enough to spell the name he bears,&mdash;"we
came over with William the Conqueror: the Chubbs are a very
old family; the first of the name was William the Conqueror's standard-bearer,
Reginald de Chubb. Here's our coat of arms, we've got
it on <em>all</em> our carriages,&mdash;three Chubs proper, in a field vert; the crest
a hand and dagger,&mdash;<em>because</em> he saved the king's life!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span></p>

<p>We knew this man's grandfather well, "excellent well,&mdash;he was
a fishmonger," and sold the chubs he boasts of!</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor Pogson Lillicrap is a very fine young lady indeed;
she discourses much on the gentility of Pa's and Ma's family, but
chiefly of Ma's.</p>

<p>"The Lillicraps are very ancient,&mdash;a very old family in Sussex,&mdash;settled
there long before Magna Charta; indeed, I believe they came
over with the Conqueror. But the Pogsons&mdash;Ma's family&mdash;are
much older,&mdash;in fact, descended directly from Alfred."</p>

<p>And this is perfectly true;&mdash;Alfred Pogson kept a butcher's shop
at Brighton, and was Miss Eleanor's grandfather!</p>

<p>Some persons are not content with one bad name, but write and
engrave it in duplicate. There are the Brown Browns, and the
Jackson Jacksons, the Cooper Coopers, and the Grimes Grimeses.
These families consist of many members, every one of whom is enumerated
at the greatest possible length. We once saw the programme
of some private theatricals to be enacted one Christmas at the Gamsons',&mdash;we
beg pardon, the Gamson Gamsons'. It ran as follows,&mdash;the
play being Romeo and Juliet:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Cast list">
<tr><td class ="tdl">Romeo</td><td class ="tdl in2">Mr. Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl">Mercutio</td><td class ="tdl in2">Mr. John Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl">Benvolio</td><td class ="tdl in2">Mr. Charles Peter Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl">Tybalt</td><td class ="tdl in2">Mr. James Timbury Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl">Capulet</td><td class ="tdl in2">Mr. Philip de Walker Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl">Friar Lawrence</td><td class ="tdl in2">Mr. Wellington Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl">Juliet</td><td class ="tdl in2">Miss Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl">Lady Capulet</td><td class ="tdl in2">Mrs. Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl">Nurse</td><td class ="tdl in2">Miss Horatia Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl">Page</td><td class ="tdl in2">Miss Octavia Juliana Gamson Gamson.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>And, had there been more characters to fill up, there would still have
been Gamson Gamsons to supply the vacuum.</p>

<p>Double-named people abound in watering-places, and shine in
subscription-lists. The Master of the Ceremonies' book faithfully announces
the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett Hoskins Abrahall, and
Sir Joseph and Lady Moggridge Shankey. We are told in the provincial
records of "fashionable movements" that Mr. Raggs Thimbleby
has taken a house for the season on the New Steine at Brighton;
and that Mrs. Pilcher Frisby intends to pass the winter at Cheltenham.
The Poles are in distress, and require a subscription; who
heads the list?&mdash;Mr. Munt Spriggins! There is to be a meeting in
favour of the Spitalfields weavers; who takes the chair?&mdash;Sir Runnacles
Faddy! But there would be no end to the list were we to enumerate
even a tithe of those who "rush into our head." The proverb
which dooms the dog to destruction that bears "an ill name" is
reversed in the case of man; affix whatever inharmonious compound
you please to the patronymic of a Briton, and you only add to his
celebrity: and we are firmly of opinion that the time is not far
distant, when, the powers of permutation being exhausted, opprobrious
epithets will assume their place in the rank of names, and
figure in the annals of fashion; Sir Ruffian Rascal will then walk arm-in-arm
with Lord Percy Plantagenet, and the "lovely and accomplished"
Miss Mortimer be led to the altar by the wealthy and
fashionable Sir Swindle Bully!</p>

<p>Our readers will recollect that in our first number the facetious
priest of Water-grass-hill made a notable discovery that the Rev.
Mr. Wolfe's celebrated lyric on the burial of Sir John Moore was not
original, but a translation from a French poem written to commemorate
the loss of a certain Colonel de Beaumanoir, who fell in India while
defending Pondicherry against the forces of Coote. Father Prout, it
is well known, loves a joke, and we must be cautious how we receive
his evidence, more especially as another claim to the original of Mr.
Wolfe's lines has been set up on behalf of a German poet. The following
verses were found, it is said, in the monastery of Oliva, near
Danzig, where it is well known that, during the Swedish war in Germany

to occupy, if we consider the text as it now stands to be correct? Friar Lawrence
says to Juliet, when he is recommending the expedient,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Take thou this phial, being then in bed,</div>
<div class="verse">And this distilled liquor drink thou off:</div>
<div class="verse">When presently through all thy veins shall run</div>
<div class="verse">A cold and drowsy humour, which shall seize</div>
<div class="verse">Each vital spirit, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="verse">And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death</div>
<div class="verse">Thou shalt remain <em>full two and forty hours</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">And then awake as from a pleasant sleep."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">
Juliet retires to bed on Tuesday night, at a somewhat early hour. Her mother
says after she departs, "'Tis now near night." Say it is eleven o'clock: forty-two
hours from that hour bring us to five o'clock in the evening of Thursday;
and yet we find the time of her awakening fixed in profound darkness, and not
long before the dawn. We should allow at least ten hours more, and read,
</p>

<p class="linequot">"Thou shalt remain full <em>two and fifty</em> hours,"&mdash;</p>

<p class="no-indent">
which would fix her awakening at three o'clock in the morning, a time which
has been marked in a former scene as the approach of day.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"<em>Cap.</em> Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock has crow'd,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The curfew bell hath rung,&mdash;'tis three o'clock."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">
Immediately after he says, "Good faith, 'tis day." This observation may appear
superfluously minute; but those who take the pains of reading the play
critically will find that it is dated throughout with a most exact attention to
hours. We can time almost every event. Ex. gr. Juliet dismisses the nurse
on her errand to Romeo when the clock struck nine, and complains that she has
not returned at twelve. At twelve she does return, and Juliet immediately proceeds
to Friar Lawrence's cell, where she is married without delay. Romeo
parts with his bride at once, and meets his friends while "the day is hot." Juliet
at the same hour addresses her prayer to the fiery-footed steeds of Ph&oelig;bus,
too slowly for her feelings progressing towards the west. The same exactness
is observed in every part of the play.
</p>
<p class="no-indent">
I may remark, as another instance of Romeo's ill luck, the change of the
original wedding-day. When pressed by Paris, old Capulet says that "Wednesday
is too soon,&mdash;on Thursday let it be;" but afterwards, when he imagines
that his daughter is inclined to consult his wishes, he fixes it for Wednesday,
even though his wife observes that Thursday is time enough. Had this day not
been lost, the letter of Friar Lawrence might still have been forwarded to Mantua
to explain what had occurred.</p></div>

Alasco, in <em>Kenilworth</em>:

"The old woman assured Varney that Alasco had scarce eaten or drunk since
her master's departure, living perpetually shut up in the laboratory, and talking
as if the world's continuance depended on what he was doing there.

"'I will teach him that the world hath other claims on him,' said Varney,
seizing a light and going in search of the alchemist. He returned, after a considerable
absence, very pale, but yet with his habitual sneer on his cheek and
nostril. 'Our friend,' he said, 'has exhaled.'

my in-put at the least.'

"'Ay, truly is he,' said Varney, 'and properly swollen already in the face

poison entered the brain and did its work.'

let it be remembered, too, that Prince Henry, who had all the amiable qualities

Sherborne, with an intention to restore it to Raleigh, its just owner; though by
his untimely death this good intention did not take effect."&mdash;<cite>Life of Raleigh.</cite></p></div>

"<span class="speaker">Qui.</span> Have you sent to Bottom's house yet, &amp;c.?

</p>
<p class="no-indent">
I propose that the second admirer's speech be given to Snout, who else has not
anything to say, and is introduced on the stage to no purpose. The few words
he says elsewhere in the play are all ridiculous; and the mistake of "paramour"
for "paragon" is more appropriate to him than to Quince, who corrects the <em>cacology</em>
of Bottom himself. [Act iii. sc. 1.

</p>

<p class="no-indent">is of too much importance in the company to be rebuked by so inferior a personage
as Flute. In the original draft of their play Snout was to perform Pyramus's
father, and Quince, Thisbe's father, but those parts are omitted; Snout is
the representative of Wall, and Quince has no part assigned him. Perhaps this
was intentional, as another proof of bungling.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="no-indent"><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> In comparing the characters of Sly and Bottom, we must be struck with
the remarkable profusion of picturesque and classical allusions with which both
these buffoons are surrounded. I have quoted some of the passages from Midsummer
Night's Dream above. The Induction to the Taming of the Shrew
is equally rich. There, too, we have the sylvan scenery and the cheerful sport
of the huntsman, and there we also have references to Apollo and Semiramis;
to Cytherea all in sedges hid; to Io as she was a maid; to Daphne roaming
through a thorny wood. The coincidence is not casual. Shakspeare desired to
elevate the scenes in which such grovelling characters played the principal part
by all the artificial graces of poetry, and to prevent them from degenerating into
mere farce. As I am on the subject, I cannot refrain from observing that the
remarks of Bishop Hurd on the character of the Lord in the Induction to the
Taming of the Shrew are marked by a ridiculous impertinence, and an ignorance
of criticism truly astonishing. They are made to swell, however, the strange
farrago of notes gathered by the variorum editors. The next editor may safely
spare them.
</p>
<p class="no-indent">
I have not troubled my readers with verbal criticism in this paper, but I
shall here venture on one conjectural emendation. Hermia, chiding Demetrius,
says, Act iii. sc. 2,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">Being o'er shoes in blood, wade in <em>the</em> deep,</div>
<div class="verse">And kill me too,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">
Should we not read "<em>knee</em> deep?" As you are already over your shoes, wade
on until the bloody tide reaches your knees. In Shakspeare's time <em>knee</em> was
generally spelt <em>kne</em>; and between <em>the</em> and <em>kne</em> there is not much difference in
writing.</p></div>

the brothers Grimm are known in this country by two translations. The present
tale is written in the very words of an inhabitant of Steinbach, situate in Saxe-Meiningen,
at one mile's distance from the watering-place of Liebenstein, and containing
two hundred and seventy houses, with one thousand three hundred and
thirty inhabitants, amongst whom are a hundred and sixty cutlers, and eighty lock-smiths.
The inhabitants participate in the principal fancies of those regions,&mdash;singing-birds,
flowers, song, and music. The music bands of Steinbach are some of the
best of Germany, and are the delight of its principal fairs. In our translation we
have kept as close as possible to the words of the man who related it.</p></div>

I do not mean to defend my doggrel; but I think Ariosto has not yet had an
adequate translator in English, or indeed in any language; nor, in my opinion, will
he easily find one. The poem is too long, and requires the aid of the music of the
original language to carry the reader through. I do not know what metre in English
could contend against the prolixity; but I <em>do</em> know that Ariosto sadly wants&mdash;as
what classic in the vernacular languages does not?&mdash;a better critic of his text
than he has yet found, in Italian.

<p class="no-indent">
In the above passage it is somewhat amusing to find Ariosto assuring his readers
that they might pass this particular canto, because without it "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">puo star l'istoria</i>;"
as if there were a canto in the whole poem of which the same might not be said.</p></div>

The alterations I propose are very slight. <em>Upon</em> for <em>on</em>, <em>i'faith</em> for '<em>faith</em>, and the
introduction of the word <em>one</em> in a place where it is required. The succeeding dialogue
is also in blank verse. So is the sleeping scene of Lady Macbeth; and that so
palpably, that I wonder it could ever pass for prose.</p></div>

probable wound. But this could hardly be called <em>unseaming</em>; and the wound is intentionally
horrid to suit the character of the play. So, for the same reason, when
Duncan is murdered, we are made to remark that the old man had much blood in
him.</p></div>

the above statement has recently been furnished. Within the last three months,
the ground having been opened for the common sewer opposite Meux's brewhouse,
by the end of Oxford-street, eight or ten, or more, skeletons were discovered. They
were supposed to be the remains of suicides, who had been buried there, in the
cross roads, under the old law against <em>felo de se</em>. One or two of them had perhaps
committed self-destruction; but so many could hardly have been collected by the
same act in one spot. It is much more probable that the bones there found were
those of malefactors, who after execution had been interred under the gallows on
which they suffered.</p></div>
